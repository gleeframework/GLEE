"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $10,500. This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a small profit while still ensuring you get a great deal.  Let me know your thoughts!",10500.0,Alice,1,
