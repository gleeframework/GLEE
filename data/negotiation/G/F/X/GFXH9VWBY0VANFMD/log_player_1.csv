Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider that?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is truly significant, and $12,000 is below what I can accept.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

While ideally, we'd want to get closer to $14,000, Bob is firm on his price and we're running out of rounds. Accepting $13,000 now is better than risking him walking away and getting only $12,000 from John."
