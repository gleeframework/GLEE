"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $7500 for the product? I believe this price reflects the value we both see in the product, while still allowing me to make a worthwhile purchase.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $7500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. My revised offer is $9500.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $8250? This would allow both of us to walk away with a fair deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $8250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about the value of this product to me. My revised offer is $9750. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value you place on it at $12000.",9750.0,Alice,5,
