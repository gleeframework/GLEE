"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's worth at least $1,000,000 to both of us, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. How about we start at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd need to see it closer to my budget. How about we start the conversation at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the very top end of what I'm willing to spend on this product.  Would you be willing to come down to that figure?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
