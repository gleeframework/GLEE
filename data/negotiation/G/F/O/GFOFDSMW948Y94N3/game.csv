"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and leaves me with a healthy profit. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not comfortable going down to $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000? This price would still leave you with a significant gain, and it would be a fair deal for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above your initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,112,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
