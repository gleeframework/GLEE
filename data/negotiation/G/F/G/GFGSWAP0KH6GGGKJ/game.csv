"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
