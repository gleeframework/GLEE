"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating, but still leaves room for compromise. It's a good starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my budget. While it's closer, I believe I can still negotiate a lower price. It's too early to give in and buy from John. I have 7 rounds left to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,450,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still staying within my budget. It's a reasonable middle ground that might incentivize Alice to accept the offer, as it's closer to her price than my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I have 5 rounds remaining and I believe there's still room for negotiation. My goal is to save as much money as possible, and I'm confident I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm now offering Alice my absolute maximum budget of $1,500,000. This is a final offer that I believe is fair and reasonable.  If Alice rejects this, I'll be forced to buy from John at the same price.  With only 4 rounds left, it's time to see if she's willing to meet me halfway."
