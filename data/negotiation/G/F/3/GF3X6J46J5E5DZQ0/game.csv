"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $850000. This represents a significant savings for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $925000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875000. This is a good deal for both of us - a fair compromise.  Let's work towards a final agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $875000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $912500. This is a bit closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $912500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $875000. This price point works for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal here.  Let's make it happen.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your guns, and I respect that. However, I'm not ready to accept $875000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $900000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming back to the table, but $900000 is still too high for me. I'm going to stay at $875000. This is a fair price, and we're getting closer to a deal. Let's find a way to make it work.",875000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to accept $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I'll offer the product to you for $887500. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,9,
