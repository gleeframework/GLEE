{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) and my minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Justification:**  The ""special introductory price"" framing creates a sense of urgency and implies the price might increase later. 
* **Alternative:** I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at $100. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is closer to his perceived value than mine.  While it's above my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'll counter-offer to see if I can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $90 is a fair offer, the value of this product is truly reflected in my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** I acknowledge Bob's offer as fair but reiterate the product's value to justify my higher price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $110, I am compromising while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum and closer to my initial offer.
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Power:** I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't budge much higher. I can always sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're sticking to your initial price, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider $100? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 matches my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.  There's no incentive to negotiate further or risk losing the sale. Accepting this offer guarantees I achieve my goal of maximizing profit."
