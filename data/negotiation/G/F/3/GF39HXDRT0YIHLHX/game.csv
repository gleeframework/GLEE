"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to that amount? I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. To ensure a mutually beneficial transaction, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows you to gain significant value from the product while remaining within a reasonable range for me. Let's find common ground!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $950,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel that we might be able to reach an even better agreement. How about considering $900,000? This would allow us to strike a balance between the value of the product and my financial capacity.",900000.0,Bob,4,
