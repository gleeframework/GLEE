"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-value product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $12,000. You want to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows you to potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll sell it to you for $11250. This is the lowest I can go, considering its value to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than your desired budget. You're still aiming for a lower price, and rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10750. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll sell it to you for $11000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,000 is still within your budget of $12,000.  While you'd prefer to pay less, rejecting this offer might lead to further negotiation, potentially costing you more time and ultimately resulting in buying from John at a higher price. It's better to secure the product at a price that's still within your budget."
