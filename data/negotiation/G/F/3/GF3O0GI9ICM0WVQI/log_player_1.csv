"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm countering with $14,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm countering with $14,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my initial asking price.  We're getting close to the halfway point in our negotiations, so I need to start getting serious about closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Although it's very close to my minimum price, I have a feeling that I can still get a bit more from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm countering with $13,500. We're getting very close to the end of our negotiations, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. However, I'm also aware that John is waiting in the wings, and I don't want to risk losing out on a higher price.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $12,700.  We're down to the wire and there's a real risk that I'll lose both Bob and John if I continue to haggle. $12,700 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a decent profit.  I'll take it and be glad to be done with this negotiation."
