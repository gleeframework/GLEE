"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1100000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $950000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I believe this price still represents a good value for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I value your product, $1050000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000.  This price is fair to both of us, as it allows you to make a reasonable profit while staying within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1090000. I believe this price is a good balance between our interests.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $1090000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1025000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $1025000. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the terms of the sale. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1025000, but I'd like to throw in some additional support and maintenance services worth $20000. This way, you'll get an even better deal. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
