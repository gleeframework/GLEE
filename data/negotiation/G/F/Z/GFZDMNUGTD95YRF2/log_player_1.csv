Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  $11,000 is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room:** This strategy allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, giving him a chance to negotiate while still staying above my minimum value.
* **The ""John"" factor:**  The existence of John as a buyer willing to pay $12,000 gives me a solid fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is well below my minimum value of $12,000. Accepting it would be a significant loss.
* **Potential for counter-negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's still potential for a more favorable deal if I counter-offer. 
* **John as a backup:**  I have a solid backup option in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $10,500? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  $10,500 is a compromise that meets halfway between my initial offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Emphasize value:**  My message highlights the value of the product for Bob, reminding him of its potential benefit. 
* **Appeal to reason:** I'm appealing to Bob's logic by suggesting we find ""common ground"" to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum requirement of $12,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your original offer and my initial counteroffer. How about $10,250? That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $10,250 is still below my minimum value of $12,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is not ideal, it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate closer to my desired price.  There's still room for a counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, providing me with leverage during the negotiation.

I will counter-offer Bob to try and close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,250 is closer, but it's still a little below where I need to be. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $10,375. That way, we both come out a bit ahead.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10375}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  Offering $10,375, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's offer of $10,250, shows a genuine attempt to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Highlighting the benefits:** I emphasize that this solution allows both of us to ""come out a bit ahead,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and maximizing the chance of a deal.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's make this deal happen"" subtly conveys a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept the offer without further negotiation.
* **Maintaining minimum:**  $10,375 is still above my minimum requirement of $12,000, ensuring that I don't lose money in this transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10,375 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go down to $10,200. That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too close to minimum:**  $10,200 is very close to my minimum value of $12,000, and accepting it would mean selling for a price that's barely above my minimum. 
* **Negotiation breakdown:**  Bob has shown a stubbornness in his negotiation style, consistently offering just below my desired price.  Further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a more profitable outcome for me.
* **John's offer:**  John's offer of $12,000 is significantly more advantageous, ensuring a profit and meeting my minimum value.

It's time to cut my losses and secure a deal with John to avoid further negotiation with Bob, who is unlikely to budge."
