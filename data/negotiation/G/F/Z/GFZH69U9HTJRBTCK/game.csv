"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $8,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $8,800 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go to $8,600.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8600.0,Bob,4,
