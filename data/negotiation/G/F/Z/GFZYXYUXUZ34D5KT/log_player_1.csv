I'm going to sell to John.  While I'm disappointed that I wasn't able to get a better price from Bob, I've reached a point where it's not worth risking further negotiations.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, and it's more important to me to secure that than to keep pushing for a higher price with Bob."
