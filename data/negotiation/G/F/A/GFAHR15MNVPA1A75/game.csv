"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a lower price. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still finding it hard to justify $850,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another counteroffer. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $775,000. I'm proposing a price of $812,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate the movement.  How about we settle this right now at $790,000?",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to our target price. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $790,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $815,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",815000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. It seems like we're very close, but I'm afraid I'm at my limit. If you can do $800,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to thank you for your time and move on.",800000.0,Bob,8,
