"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $10,000. There are 9 rounds left to negotiate, so rejecting Alice's initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to offer $10,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down to $11,500. This is closer to Bob's ideal price of $10,000, but it's still not there. Since there are still 7 rounds of negotiation left, it's worth rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is very close to Bob's ideal price of $10,000. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's likely that the price won't drop much further. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price well below John's offer of $15,000."
