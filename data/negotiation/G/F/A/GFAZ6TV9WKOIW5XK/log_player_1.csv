Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $900000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you've described.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

While $900,000 is closer to what I envisioned,  I need to make a slightly higher price to make this deal worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.
