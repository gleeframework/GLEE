Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $130 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  It's crucial that my offer to Bob is significantly more attractive than John's $100 offer, ensuring I maximize my potential profit."
