"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's closer to my budget and still a good deal for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is a good compromise, but I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we meet at $127? It's a small step from $125, but it's still a great deal for you and I think it's fair",127.0,Alice,5,
