"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal on this product, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than Alice's value, it's significantly more than you need to pay. You know John will sell it to you for $8,000. There's a chance Alice might come down in price, so rejecting her initial offer keeps negotiation open."
