"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is a good starting point that's still beneficial to me while leaving room for negotiation.  I've included a message that acknowledges Bob's potential value and emphasizes the potential for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8500.  Given your own valuation, I believe this price is fair and gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet. I'm aiming for a higher profit and believe I can still get a better deal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $9,500 is my best offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000? This price is still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price, and it's still a good deal for him.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a solid profit without risking further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
