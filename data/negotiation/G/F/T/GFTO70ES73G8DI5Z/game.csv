"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $5,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference at $8,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $5,000 is a big jump, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a fair offer considering John is offering it to me right now for $8,000",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. $7,000 is closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $9,000? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. Let's close this deal! ",9000.0,Alice,5,
