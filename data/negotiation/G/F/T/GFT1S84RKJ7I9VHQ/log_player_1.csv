Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I believe a price of $12,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible while ensuring the deal is still very appealing to him. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $12,000 gives Bob a significant discount ($3,000) compared to his perceived value, making it likely he'll accept. 
* **Alternative Guarantee:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, we're guaranteed $8,000 from John. This safety net allows us to aim higher with Bob."
