"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I believe a price of $12,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $12,000 is cheaper than buying from John for $15,000. 
* While Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($8,000), it's still within Bob's budget and allows him to save $3,000 compared to buying from John."
