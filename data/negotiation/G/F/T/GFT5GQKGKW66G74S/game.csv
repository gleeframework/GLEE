,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in between?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum requirement, so I'm offering it to you for $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value.",13500.0,Alice,5,
