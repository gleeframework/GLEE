Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the difference between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is getting smaller and smaller.  It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation for a potentially small gain.  Selling to John guarantees the best outcome."
