"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $7500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $8250. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit above $7000, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7000. I can offer you a compromise at $8000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that you've already shown interest in it. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",8000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6800 and $8000, which would be $7400. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know if you're interested.",7400.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point of no return, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $7200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm not sure if I can continue the negotiation beyond this point.",7200.0,Alice,9,
