"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product has for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $16,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $15,000.  This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept $15,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need $17,000 to make it worth my while. This is my final offer, I'm not going to go any lower than this.",17000.0,Alice,5,
