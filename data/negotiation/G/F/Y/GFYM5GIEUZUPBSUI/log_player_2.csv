"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $140. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is within your budget of $150. While you could reject it hoping for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will offer one. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price lower than John's $150."
