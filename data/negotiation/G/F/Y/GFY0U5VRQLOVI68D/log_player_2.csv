"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's more than double your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which is my maximum budget. This establishes my willingness to negotiate, but also clearly shows Alice that I'm not willing to pay more.  It will be interesting to see if Alice is willing to come down to my price, or if we'll need to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, it's still significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping that Alice will get closer to my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,500,000, which is still below Alice's current offer, but demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise. This is a middle ground that could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much from her price.  While her offer is slightly lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly above my budget. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  I've already established my maximum willingness to pay, and further negotiations with Alice are unlikely to yield a more favorable outcome."
