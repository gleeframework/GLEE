Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do a bit better than $13,250.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $12,800 is still a good deal for me. It's more than I'd get from John, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher."
