"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do a bit better than $13,250.",12800.0,Bob,4,
