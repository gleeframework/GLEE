Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible, as that's my guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving me a chance to still secure a price higher than $800,000. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price and potentially sway Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While I know Bob values it at $800,000, he might be willing to pay slightly more if he perceives the product as essential or a good investment.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, but the potential reward of securing a much higher price than $800,000 makes it worth the attempt."
