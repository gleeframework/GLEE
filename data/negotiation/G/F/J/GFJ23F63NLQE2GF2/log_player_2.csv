"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price.  He has a significant buffer between his maximum price and Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. This counteroffer is a bold move, but it's within his budget and leaves room for negotiation. By offering $1,200,000, Bob demonstrates he's serious about buying the product but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, and $1,300,000 is a good price for Bob. This is a better deal than buying from John, and Bob can likely still get a slightly better price by continuing negotiations. However, the risk of continuing negotiations is that Alice might get stubborn and stick to her current offer, or worse, increase the price again.  It's a gamble, and  $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise."
