"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a strong opening offer, showing that I believe the product is valuable. It leaves room for negotiation while still being a profitable sale for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could sell to John for $800,000, I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing my willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally come to my minimum price. Accepting this offer is the best option as it maximizes my earnings.  While I could sell to John for the same price, there's no guarantee that I could get a better deal in the remaining rounds with Bob."
