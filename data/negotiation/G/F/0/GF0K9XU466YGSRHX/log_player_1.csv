"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My price is $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a strong starting point:

* **Message:**  It's friendly and suggests the product is valuable.  
* **Price:**  It's above Bob's value but below your minimum, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is just a little too low for me.  How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107.5 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit too low.  How about $110? I'm willing to meet you halfway on that."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $108 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite enough. There are still a few rounds left, so I'm going to try to push for a higher price. I'll see if I can convince Bob to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. It feels like we're really close though. Would you consider $109? I'm feeling very flexible at this point."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $109 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $108.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob not willing to budge much more, it's time to cut my losses. I'll sell the product to John for $120. While it's not the price I was hoping for, it's still better than settling for Bob's offer."
