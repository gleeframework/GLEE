"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is just a little too low for me.  How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. It feels like we're really close though. Would you consider $109? I'm feeling very flexible at this point.",109.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $109 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $108.50. Can you consider that?",108.5,Bob,8,
