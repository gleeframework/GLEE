"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $12,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm looking to get a good return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I acknowledge the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me at this point.  I'm happy to discuss a price closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $11,500. This is a fair price, taking into account my initial investment and the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to see if I can push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $11,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $11,000.  This would allow us both to come away satisfied with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to $11,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you a price of $11,250. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is getting very close to my target price of $11,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my offer again and I'll end up having to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's better to secure the product at a price that's still within my budget and leaves me with a good deal."
