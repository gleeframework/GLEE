Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I acknowledge the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me at this point.  I'm happy to discuss a price closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
