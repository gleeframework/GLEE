{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is higher than Bob's valuation of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still well above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring a profitable sale if Bob accepts. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is friendly and leaves space for Bob to respond.

Remember, the goal is to find a price that both you and Bob are happy with, while also keeping the option open to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While I value your willingness to negotiate, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll still find the product very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've considered your last offer, but I'm still unable to go beyond $10,000. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions and the value I expect to receive from the product. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before selling to John.  I think there's still room for a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  $10,000 is a better offer, but I'm still very close to my minimum. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested, or I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still not able to go above $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its current market value. I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I would prefer to make a higher profit, Bob is sticking to his $10,000 offer. At this point, I've already made a significant concession and I'm unwilling to go lower.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale with John for $15,000."
