"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to beat. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and counteroffering is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it's within my budget.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. Bob wants to save as much as possible, and there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows him to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit stretched at $1,300,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  This price allows me to stay within my budget while still giving you a good return on your investment.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,275,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,285,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can see the value in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,285,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,285,000 is very close to Bob's budget, he has already made multiple counteroffers, and it seems unlikely that Alice will go lower.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 saves Bob $85,000 and avoids further negotiation. This is the most cost-effective decision at this point."
