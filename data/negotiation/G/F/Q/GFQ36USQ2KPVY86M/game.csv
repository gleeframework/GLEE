,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can do $110, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. I think that's a fair price for the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $95, but I can do $105. That's as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're willing to meet me at $105, I'll make it happen.",105.0,Alice,5,
