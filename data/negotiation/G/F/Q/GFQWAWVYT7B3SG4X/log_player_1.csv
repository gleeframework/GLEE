Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to try and negotiate further with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a price point higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping that by being flexible but not giving in entirely, I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $16,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to what I initially wanted.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might get frustrated and walk away. It's better to secure the deal and move on."
