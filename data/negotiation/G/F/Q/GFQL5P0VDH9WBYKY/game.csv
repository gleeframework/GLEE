"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  However, $9,500 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  This is the highest I can go right now.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $8,500? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If we can agree on this, I'll take the product today.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,250. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,250 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,100, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",8100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $8,100, but I'm not going to give up on getting a bit more. How about we discuss $8,150? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",8150.0,Alice,7,
