"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a price closer to your $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm ready to buy the product today, but I need a price closer to my budget.  I'm offering $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing your seriousness about negotiating and also creating some room for compromise.  $9,500 is a fair starting point, considering your budget and Alice's potential profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product at $10,500. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is very close to your maximum price of $10,000. While you could continue negotiating and potentially get a slightly better deal, there's a risk Alice will reject further counteroffers, and you might end up paying more.  Accepting Alice's offer is the safest option, ensuring you get the product at a reasonable price within your budget."
