"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm ready to buy the product today, but I need a price closer to my budget.  I'm offering $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product at $10,500. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
