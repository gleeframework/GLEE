This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product but still leaves room for negotiation if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $100 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but $90 is my absolute limit. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
