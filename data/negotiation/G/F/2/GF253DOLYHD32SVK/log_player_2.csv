You have three options:

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $100, since the product is worth $120 to her."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $95. That's still a great price for you and it gives me a bit more room to negotiate. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price of $80."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $92.50. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

```

Alice has come down to $92.50, which is a good price, but it's still above your target of $80. It seems like further negotiation might be possible, but it's getting close to your limit.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $80, so it's safer to take that deal and avoid the risk of Alice continuing to stall or not accepting your next counteroffer."
