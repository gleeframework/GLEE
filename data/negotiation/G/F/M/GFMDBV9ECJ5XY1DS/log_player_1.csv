Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:**  The message starts by piquing Bob's interest and emphasizing the product's value.
* **High Anchor:** By starting with a price of $1,500,000, I set a high anchor. Even though Bob might try to negotiate down, this starting point increases the chances of closing a deal closer to my desired price.
* **Alternative Buyer (John) as Leverage:** While I don't explicitly mention John, the fact that I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives me confidence to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
