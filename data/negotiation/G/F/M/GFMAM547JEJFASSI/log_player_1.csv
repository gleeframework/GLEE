Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it to Bob for his maximum valuation ($1,000,000), we know John will buy it for more. We need to find a price that encourages Bob to buy while still maximizing our profit.
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,450,000 is a high price, but it's still significantly less than John's offer. This creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob.
* **One-Time Offer:**  By stating it's a one-time offer, we increase the pressure on Bob to make a decision without trying to negotiate further."
