Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it immediately. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
