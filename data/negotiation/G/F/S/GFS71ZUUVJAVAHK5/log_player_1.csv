Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a significant profit.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further details."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but still provides me with a decent profit. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, highlighting the potential benefits for Bob. It also leaves the door open for further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The initial offer is high enough to see if Bob is seriously considering buying the product.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my absolute minimum, allowing for some bargaining.
* **Maintain a strong position:** The offer is high enough that if Bob rejects it, I have a backup plan with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, potentially reaching a point where it's more beneficial to sell to Bob than to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price is still fair for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $950,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining a reasonable profit. 
* **Message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's offer and express my willingness to negotiate.  I also highlight the fairness of the proposed price, focusing on the product's value.

**Strategy:**

By offering a slightly lower price while remaining firm, I'm aiming to:

* **Signal my willingness to negotiate:**  Show that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Close the gap:** Bring the price closer to my desired range while keeping the possibility of John's offer as a safety net.
* **Encourage Bob to counter:**  Leave the door open for another counteroffer from Bob, potentially leading to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough to make me comfortable.  At this point, I'm realizing that the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is higher than the potential reward. John is guaranteed to pay $1,200,000, which is significantly more than what I'm currently being offered. 

**Strategy:**

It's important to balance potential profit with the likelihood of a successful negotiation.  In this case, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the possibility of a slightly higher price from Bob."
