"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this fantastic product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's a chance you might get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good profit, and it's the highest I can go at this time. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is still above your maximum budget.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will keep rejecting your offers and you'll end up spending more time and possibly more money. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring you get the best price and avoid further negotiation."
