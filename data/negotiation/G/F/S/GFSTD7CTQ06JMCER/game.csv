"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good profit, and it's the highest I can go at this time. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
