"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? I believe that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $6,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That would work for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
