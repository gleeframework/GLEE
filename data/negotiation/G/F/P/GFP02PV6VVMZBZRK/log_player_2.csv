"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still more than the product is worth to him ($10,000). It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to the product's worth to him as possible.  He's offering $10,500, which is halfway between his maximum price and Alice's initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate but still leaves room for Alice to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob has already established a willingness to negotiate, and Alice's counteroffer is only a slightly better deal than her initial offer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially as Bob has 7 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with a strategy of incremental negotiation.  He's increased his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but still aiming for a price closer to his desired value.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward without giving in too quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Even though Bob is running out of rounds, there's still potential to get a better deal.  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate and Alice is also showing flexibility. There's a chance she'll come down further if he keeps pushing. It's still worth trying to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise. However, he's still aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. This keeps the pressure on Alice to negotiate further and prevents her from pushing for a quick close at a high price. With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob needs to find a balance between pushing for a better deal and risking losing the opportunity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still too high. Bob has only three rounds left and needs to be strategic. If he accepts, he'll save $1,500 compared to buying from John, but he might be able to get a better price.  It's worth risking one more round to see if Alice will come down further. If she doesn't, he can always switch to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's latest offer but is still trying to keep the price below his maximum.  This counteroffer demonstrates his commitment to closing the deal while maintaining some leverage. With only two rounds left, the pressure is mounting, but Bob needs to be cautious about accepting a price that's too high. If Alice rejects this offer, he'll need to decide if he wants to accept her next offer or go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $1,000 away from John's price.  Bob has only one round left, and there's a high chance that Alice will reject his counteroffer.  With only one round left, he won't be able to get a better price, and it's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than risk losing the opportunity. Buying from John is the safest and most efficient choice at this point."
