"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product at a competitive price of $1750000.  I believe it represents a great value for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let's start the conversation!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1200000 is significantly below the value I'm seeking for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This price still reflects a substantial benefit to you, and it allows me to achieve my minimum target. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1500000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1300000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To make this deal work, I'm willing to drop my price to $1400000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close to a deal, but we need to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price allows us both to benefit from the transaction. I believe this is a fair compromise that we can both live with. Let's finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
