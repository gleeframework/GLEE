"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome.
* **Understanding Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, giving us a good understanding of his potential price ceiling. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, while still keeping the price significantly above your $800,000 minimum.
* **Confidence and Politeness:** The message is phrased confidently and politely, promoting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly below Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation. We are in the early rounds and have leverage to aim for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob, but $950,000 undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from this product."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Stand Firm:**  We are acknowledging Bob's offer but holding firm on a price closer to our initial offer. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate but not be easily swayed.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the value proposition, subtly reminding Bob of the benefits he gains, justifying the higher price.
* **Strategic Movement:**  The counter-offer reduces the gap,  signaling to Bob we are open to negotiation but expect him to move towards our desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. Is that something we can agree on? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,075,000 is a strong offer, significantly exceeding our minimum price and representing a good portion of the potential profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is clearly willing to pay a premium for the product and has steadily increased his offer. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, securing a deal now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling. 

Accepting at $1,075,000 guarantees a significant profit and avoids potential downsides of continued negotiation."
