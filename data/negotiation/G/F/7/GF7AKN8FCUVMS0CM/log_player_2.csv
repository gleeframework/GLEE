"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is still within Bob's budget and is a better price than what John is offering. It's likely that further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away or Bob might end up paying more than $1,080,000. It's a good time to secure the product at a reasonable price."
