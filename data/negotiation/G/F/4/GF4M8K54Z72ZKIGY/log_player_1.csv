"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. My goal is to see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to pay a premium. If he rejects this offer, I can gauge his interest level and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good profit for me. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a bit higher.  I have a few rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to close the deal.  I'm running out of rounds, so I need to find a way to get Bob to accept soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for the same amount.  It's better to secure the sale and move on."
