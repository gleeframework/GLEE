"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000? I think that's a fair price that would allow us both to benefit.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway at $1,000,000, which is the minimum value I'm willing to accept for the product. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
