Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth $10,000 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit.  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counter and potentially even go down to my minimum of $10,000. However, I'm also confident that I can get a better price than John is offering.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $8,500 is simply not acceptable. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $9,500.  This shows Bob I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my valuation. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm confident that I can't get much more out of him.  While I'd prefer more,  it's better to secure a sale than risk losing both Bob and John."
