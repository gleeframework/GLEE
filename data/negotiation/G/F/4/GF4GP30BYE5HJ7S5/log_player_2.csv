"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is under your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $10,000. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a subsequent offer to avoid having to go to John."
