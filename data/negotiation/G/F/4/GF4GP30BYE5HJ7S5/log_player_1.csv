Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a great price.
* **Time Value & Certainty:** Offering it to Bob directly before going to John provides Bob a sense of exclusivity and allows Alice to potentially close the deal faster. 
 
This strategy balances getting the highest price from Bob while acknowledging that Alice has a strong alternative if Bob declines."
