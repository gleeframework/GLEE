"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I believe $10,000 is a fair price that gives me a good profit while still being attractive to Bob.  This leaves room for 2 rounds of counteroffers before I need to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for your product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to get more. I have 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $9,500 to make this deal work. This is still a great price for you, and it gives me a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the reduction, but I still believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $8,500 for your product. Let me know if this works for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not ready to accept.  I have 6 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate.  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the reduction, but I still believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $8,750 for your product. Let me know if this works for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I have 4 rounds left, so there's still time to see if we can agree on a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8875}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I've been pushing for a higher price, but Bob seems to be holding firm. We're only $75 apart, and with only two rounds left, I need to decide. Accepting his offer will give me a decent profit and avoid the risk of losing the sale entirely. While I'd like to get a bit more, it's probably not worth the risk of further negotiation."
