"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1500000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit steep for me. To start, I'd be willing to offer $800000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is my minimum price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1200000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $900000, which reflects a significant move on my part. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000, which is closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point.  $1100000 is still outside my budget, but I can go up to $1000000. This would be a good compromise, and hopefully we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price point, Bob, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $1050000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you at $1025000. This is a significant move from my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1025000, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if that's enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to be at $1075000 to feel comfortable. Let's see if we can push the needle a bit further.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
