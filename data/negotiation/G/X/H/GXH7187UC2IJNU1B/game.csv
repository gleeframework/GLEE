"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great value for the product's worth to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
