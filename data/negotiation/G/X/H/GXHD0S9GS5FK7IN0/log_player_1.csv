Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my target price. Since I value the product at $12,000 and know I have a backup buyer willing to pay that, there's no reason to start lower.  I'll see if Bob is willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not going to accept that offer. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering a price of $11,000. This is still significantly higher than his offer but lower than my initial ask, hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and it seems unlikely that he'll budge much further. I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum value. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling for a price significantly lower than what the product is worth to me."
