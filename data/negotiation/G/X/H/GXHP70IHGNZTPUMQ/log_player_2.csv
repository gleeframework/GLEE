It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $50. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and might make her more likely to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

$55 is a good price, and it's likely Alice won't budge further. It's better to accept the offer and save money than to risk further negotiation or buying from John at a higher price."
