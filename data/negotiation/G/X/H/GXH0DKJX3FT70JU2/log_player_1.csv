{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach allows for a potential compromise and maximizes the chances of a successful sale. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, always keeping my minimum value of $12,000 in mind. If negotiations stall, I can always go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can do better. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm hoping for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $9,800.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand your position, but I'm still working within my budget constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,600 for the product. I hope this might be more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $9,600 is very close to my previous offer of $9,800.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to $10,000, I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to accept John's offer.  It's important to be realistic and recognize that sometimes a deal is a deal.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
