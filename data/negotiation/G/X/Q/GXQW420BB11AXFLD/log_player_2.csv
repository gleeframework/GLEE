Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a good deal for both of us, allowing me to get closer to my target and you to secure a valuable asset.  Let's find a middle ground.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than John's, there's still room for negotiation and Bob can potentially save more money.  There's not a huge difference between Alice's latest offer and his counter offer, so it makes sense to continue negotiating."
