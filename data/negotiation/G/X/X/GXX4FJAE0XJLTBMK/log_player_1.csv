{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly very interested and willing to negotiate. We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate without settling for less than our fallback."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in this product and your willingness to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we settle on $1,390,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your position."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in finding a mutually beneficial price, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,385,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,385,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,385,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently increasing his offers in smaller increments, indicating he's nearing his limit. Accepting $1,385,000 secures a significant profit above our $1,200,000 fallback with John, and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
