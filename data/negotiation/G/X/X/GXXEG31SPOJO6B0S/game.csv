"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1800000 is unfortunately far above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can currently afford.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1800000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. Considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1200000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm offering $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm offering $1100000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
