"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $6,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $7,200. This is a good middle ground that still reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above $6,850. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $7,100. This is the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit.
