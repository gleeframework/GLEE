# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is overpriced:**  While her message tries to frame $950,000 as a discount, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.
* **Negotiation potential:** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're a serious buyer but also price-conscious. There's a good chance she'll come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, you open the door for further negotiation with Alice. You might be able to get the product for significantly less than $950,000, saving even more money."
