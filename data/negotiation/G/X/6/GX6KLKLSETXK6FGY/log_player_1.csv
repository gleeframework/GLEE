Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a significantly higher price than John's offer, hoping Bob values the product even more. It's important to leave room for negotiation, but also to set a high bar from the start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, showing flexibility but still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer.  This should encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement over John's offer, and it's close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high."
