Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll sell it to you for $950,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $950,000.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John at $800,000 is the most financially sound decision."
