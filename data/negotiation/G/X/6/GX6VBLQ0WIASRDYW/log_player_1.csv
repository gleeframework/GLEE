Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Offering $120:**  This is a price that is above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still lower than what I would get from John ($150). 
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to make the offer appealing to Bob, highlighting the potential value he gets.

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of selling to Bob while still securing a decent profit."
