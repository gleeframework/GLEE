(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but closer. I'll reject and try to get a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
