"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to propose a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 
We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room for negotiation. Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value than mine, so I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product to your business is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

We're getting close, but I believe the product is worth pushing a bit further. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,360,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done while still reflecting the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your persistence, but I'm still not convinced. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,280,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the value I'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While it's tempting to push for more, Bob's offer is now only slightly above John's guaranteed offer.  Continuing the negotiation has diminishing returns and carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer further. It's time to accept and close the deal."
