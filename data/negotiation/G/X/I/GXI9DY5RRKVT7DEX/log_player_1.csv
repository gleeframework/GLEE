Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high at $175, knowing it's more than what Bob values it at. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and optimistic, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. I also emphasize the value of the product to make it more appealing. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with maintaining a positive relationship with Bob, potentially leading to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. I'm not willing to sell at such a loss. I'll counteroffer Bob, hoping to find a price that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price to $140, which is still above my minimum of $150. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a reasonable profit. 
* **Message:** I'm reiterating Bob's interest and highlighting the value of the product again. I'm also using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable.

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that satisfies both parties and potentially leads to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  John is offering a guaranteed $150, which meets my minimum requirement.  Selling to John is the most financially advantageous choice in this situation."
