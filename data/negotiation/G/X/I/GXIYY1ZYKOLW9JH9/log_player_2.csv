"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $90? That's a pretty significant discount from my original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on price, she's unlikely to reach your $80 limit. John offers a guaranteed price that meets your needs, making it the most logical choice at this point."
