Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, but I think it's a bit steep at $1,500,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise to ensure you benefit from the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,350,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet her halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $1,300,000.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
