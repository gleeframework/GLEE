"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise to ensure you benefit from the product's value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
