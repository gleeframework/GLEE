"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $50 is significantly below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm willing to be flexible to make this work.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is a bit steep for me. How about we try $70? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $70 is still far too low for me. Let's compromise at $100. This is my final offer. ",100.0,Alice,5,
