Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still being profitable for me.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but if not, I'll be ready to counter his offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I believe I can still get more from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175.  This is a compromise, but still above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer $175,  $160 is a good price and it's better than selling to John for $150."
