"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $95 is still a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
