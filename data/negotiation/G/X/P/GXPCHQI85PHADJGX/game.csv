"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives me a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at that price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to drop to $950,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $1,050,000?  This price still allows me a reasonable return, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. How about $1,025,000? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $1,025,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,037,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. What do you say?",1037500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I really need to stay within my budget. How about $1,022,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,025,000, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",1022500.0,Bob,6,
