{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love! I'm asking for $125 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is a good compromise between my minimum value and Bob's perceived value. This way, I leave room for negotiation without instantly pushing Bob away with a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $125 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I can still aim for a higher price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $100 is my minimum, I'm willing to go a little higher to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and settle at $112.50?"", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $106? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $106 is just above my minimum acceptable price and is a good compromise.  It's not ideal, but it's a better deal than selling to John for $100, so I'll accept it."
