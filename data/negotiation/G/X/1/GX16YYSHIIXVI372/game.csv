"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,500? That's a fair compromise, and it still leaves you with a good value for the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
