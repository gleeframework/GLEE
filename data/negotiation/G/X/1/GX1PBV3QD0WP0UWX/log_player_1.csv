Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 
I'm starting with a price of $140. This gives Bob a little wiggle room to negotiate, but it's also a good starting point to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is a compromise that's closer to my initial offer, but still leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he's willing."
