"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $8500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $9250? It's a fair compromise and allows me to make a little profit.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $9250 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000.  This is my final offer, as I can always buy from John for $8000.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",9000.0,Bob,4,
