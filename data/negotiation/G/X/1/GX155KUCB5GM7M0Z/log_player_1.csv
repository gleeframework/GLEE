Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value of $120 and leaves room for potential negotiation.  It's also below Bob's perceived value of $150, so there's a good chance he'll find it appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below my ideal price point. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm countering with $135. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway. Hopefully, this price will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, while still allowing me to get closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over selling to John.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield much more.  It's best to accept the current offer and finalize the sale."
