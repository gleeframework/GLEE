"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it! I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her, closer to her $10,000 value. If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on John's offer."
