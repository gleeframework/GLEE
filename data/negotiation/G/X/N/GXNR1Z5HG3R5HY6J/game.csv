"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,200 is still a little out of my range. I'm happy to meet you halfway *again* at $8,750.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,750. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about my costs and my profit margin. I can do $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have your costs to consider, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this deal happen.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $8,800 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. I can do $9,100, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to work with me. I'm also considering my options, and to be honest,  $9,100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,900, which is a significant increase from my last offer. This is a final offer from me.  I believe it's fair, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",8900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm starting to think that we might be getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. I can do $9,050, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9050.0,Alice,9,
