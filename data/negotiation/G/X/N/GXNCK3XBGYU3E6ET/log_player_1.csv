Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can still sell it to John for $80, so I'm not taking a significant risk.  This approach balances the desire for maximum profit with the possibility of losing the sale to John."
