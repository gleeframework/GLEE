Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This is a strategic starting point.  Here's why:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  By starting at $1,400,000, you leave room for negotiation and potentially get closer to your desired price.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You've set a firm minimum of $1,500,000, so if Bob rejects this offer, you're still in a good position to walk away and sell to John.
* **It's a good opening message:**  The message is friendly but firm, setting the stage for a productive negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I am only willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below your minimum price of $1,500,000.
* **You have a better option:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed way to achieve your goal. However, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price and try to close the gap.  You have a strong position in this negotiation, so you don't need to accept a deal that's so far below your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this counteroffer:

* **Midpoint approach:** This counteroffer is a midpoint between your previous offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000. It signals your willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price that's closer to your desired value.
* **Strong message:** The message conveys a firm stance while remaining open to negotiation. It also reinforces the value of the product.
* **Remaining flexibility:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, you still have the option to accept his initial offer or sell to John, giving you a safety net.

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I still believe the product should be within my budget. I am willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Still below your minimum:**  While Bob has moved up slightly, $1,250,000 is still below your minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* **You have a guaranteed alternative:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a better option than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Room for further negotiation:** You can still make a counteroffer to try and reach a price closer to your desired value.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below your minimum. It also allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, I can't go lower than $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

Here's why:

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is a clear indication that you are willing to negotiate but have a firm lower limit. It's a slight concession from your previous offer but still above Bob's last offer.
* **Strong Closing Message:** The message is direct and emphasizes the potential for a beneficial agreement.  
* **No More Concessions:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you can move forward with selling to John, as you've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to be successful. 

This counteroffer leaves the ball in Bob's court. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this careful consideration and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. This is my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Here's why:

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's a slight increase, $1,275,000 is still below your minimum price of $1,500,000.
* **No further negotiation is likely:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, indicating he's unlikely to go higher. 
* **You have a better alternative:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees you your minimum price and achieves your goal.

There's no need to continue negotiating with Bob when you have a guaranteed deal with John that meets your requirements."
