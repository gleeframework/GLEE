Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident it would be a wise investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) while staying above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation if he tries to haggle. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, making it more likely Bob will accept a higher price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a safety net in John, so we can afford to be ambitious with our initial offer to Bob."
