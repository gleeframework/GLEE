Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for a bit more.  How about $110? That's still a great price for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be. Let's find a solution that works for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Alice's offer of $110 is a good deal for you.  It's less than your maximum budget of $150 and still gives Alice a reasonable profit.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product and save some money."
