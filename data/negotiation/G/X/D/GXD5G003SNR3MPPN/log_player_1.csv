I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $13,500 is still a decent profit, but I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $13,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a slightly better price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
