"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $8,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $9500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $9,500 is still lower than John's price of $12,000 and leaves some room for Alice to make a profit.  It's a good compromise and Bob should accept to save money."
