Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob might counteroffer, and you can still potentially reach a price closer to his valuation of $15,000.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A much higher price might scare Bob off right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still lower than the initial offer you made. You want to see if you can get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,500 would be my final offer.  If this doesn't work for you, I'm going to have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Finality:** I'm calling this my final offer to put pressure on Bob.
* **Alternative:**  Mentioning other options makes Bob aware of the potential loss if he doesn't agree."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.
