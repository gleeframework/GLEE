"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7,000. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $8,200 for the product. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise. However, $8,200 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Could you meet me halfway at $7,600? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",7600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not comfortable going any lower than $8,500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",8500.0,Alice,5,
