"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am only able to commit to a maximum of $1200000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1250000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
