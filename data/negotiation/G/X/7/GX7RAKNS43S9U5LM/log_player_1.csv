"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,700,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $1,400,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make a profit. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit. This is my best offer, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's what John is willing to pay.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate."
