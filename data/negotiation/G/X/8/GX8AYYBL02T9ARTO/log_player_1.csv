Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to see it as a potential bargain. 
* **Exclusivity:**  By phrasing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" we create a sense of urgency and value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open if he's highly interested.

**Important Note:**  We don't want to go too low initially, as it might undervalue the product and make Bob suspicious. This approach balances risk and potential reward."
