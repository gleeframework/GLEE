"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $60 significantly undervalues the product.  To be fair, I could come down to $95. This is my final offer.",95.0,Alice,3,
