Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have leverage.  Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" you frame the product as a worthwhile investment, justifying the high price. 
* **Openness to discussion:**  While aiming high, appearing flexible and open to negotiation makes Bob more likely to engage rather than immediately reject the offer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on maximizing profit. However, factors like your relationship with Bob, his negotiation style, and market dynamics could influence your approach."
