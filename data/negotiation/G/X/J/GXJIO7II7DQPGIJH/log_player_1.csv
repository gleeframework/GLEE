Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.  It also allows me to adjust the price if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **The Backup Plan:** Remember, I have a backup buyer in John who will pay my minimum price. This allows me to walk away if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $6,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even below the value the product has to Bob ($8,000). Accepting it would be a huge loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's interested. Rejecting it allows me to counter with a more reasonable price, aiming for a better outcome than a quick sale at a loss.
* **The Backup Plan:** Remember, selling to John guarantees me my minimum price. This option remains available if the negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can work with.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm proposing a price of $8,500, which is halfway between my last offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($6,500). This shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I remind Bob that this is still a good deal for him, as it's below the value he places on the product.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:**  I continue to be friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation going. 
* **The Backup Plan:**  Remember, selling to John for $12,000 is still an option if Bob doesn't accept this counteroffer.  I'm confident that this offer is reasonable enough to secure a deal with Bob while still ensuring I make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $6,500 is quite a gap from your initial offer, Alice.  How about we try $7,500? I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** While $7,500 is still below my minimum, it's a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer. It shows he's willing to negotiate and come closer to my expectations.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** If I keep rejecting offers, there's a chance Bob will get frustrated and walk away. This could lead to a stalemate, forcing me to sell to John at a lower profit. 
* **Timing is Key:**  The negotiation has already gone back and forth a few times. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further delays. 
* **The Backup Plan:** Remember, John is still an option if the negotiations with Bob completely fall apart. However, at this point, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice to secure a sale and earn a decent profit."
