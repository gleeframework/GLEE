The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $115. While this is a good price, you can likely do better.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice has increased her offer slightly to $117.  While this is not your ideal price, it is still below your maximum of $120. It's not worth risking further negotiation, as it is very likely that Alice will not go lower and you could end up paying $120 to John."
