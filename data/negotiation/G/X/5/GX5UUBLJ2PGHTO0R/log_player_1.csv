Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm offering it to you at $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, I'm aiming to stay closer to $10,500. Would you be willing to come down a bit to make this work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is offering $500 more than my minimum, and significantly closer to his own valuation. There's a risk he walks away if I push further.
