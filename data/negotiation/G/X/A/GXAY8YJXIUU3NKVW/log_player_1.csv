**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently moved in smaller increments and has now reached a point where he's unlikely to go much higher than $1,050,000. While we still have rounds left, the risk of him lowballing further or reaching a stalemate is high. Accepting his offer would net us $50,000 more than John's offer, but the difference isn't substantial enough to warrant the risk of continuing the negotiation. 

Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and avoids potentially wasting more time and effort on a negotiation that might not yield a significantly better outcome."
