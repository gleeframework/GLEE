Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **50% markup:** Offering the product at $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup. While this is a significant increase, it leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a much higher profit. 
* **Positive language:** The message focuses on the product's value and potential, justifying the high price and encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The phrasing ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in discussion and potentially negotiate the price, rather than presenting a firm, take-it-or-leave-it offer. 

By starting high and expressing confidence in the product's value, you maximize your chances of securing a deal significantly above your minimum acceptable price."
