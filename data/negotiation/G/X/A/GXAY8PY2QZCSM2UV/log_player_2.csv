"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is a bit too high. There's room for negotiation to try and get a price closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's offer, I'm aiming to understand her bottom line and leave room for negotiation.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but makes it clear I'm looking for a better price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is closer to Alice's value ($120) than my maximum ($150), giving her an incentive to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $110 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate down from her original price, but we're not there yet.  There's still room to maneuver before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, $110 is quite a jump. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
 ""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Fair:**  By offering $120, I'm aiming directly at Alice's known value for the product.  This shows I'm serious about buying but also unwilling to go higher. 
* **Ending the Negotiation?:** This offer might be Alice's limit. If she rejects it, I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John, as further haggling is unlikely to yield significant savings."
