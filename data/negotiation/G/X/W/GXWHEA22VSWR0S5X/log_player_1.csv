"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and lets him know I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I want to see if I can push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not convinced this is the best deal I can get. I'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price but still holding out for a price closer to my minimum value.  I'm hoping this will be enough to tempt Bob into a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm disappointed that I wasn't able to reach a deal with Bob, his latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.  I've had six rounds of negotiation, and I'm concerned we may not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds.  To ensure I get at least my minimum value, I'll sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
