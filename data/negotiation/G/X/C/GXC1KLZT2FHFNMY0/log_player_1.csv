{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, leaving room for negotiation. It also provides a reason for the price and tries to create a connection with Bob by suggesting the product is perfect for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer $120 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its condition and features. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $120 is a decent offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to $135 for the product. It's in excellent condition and offers some unique features. I believe this price is still fair, considering its value.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. I am willing to go up to $130 for it. This is my final offer, as I also need to consider my budget for purchasing the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is above your minimum acceptable price of $100.  While you might prefer a higher price, it's important to consider that further negotiations might lead to a rejection and force you to sell to John for a lower price.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most practical choice in this scenario."
