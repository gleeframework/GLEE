"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects its worth while leaving room for a beneficial deal on your end.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I find the price a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 falls significantly short of the true value of this product. To move forward, I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's worth.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the movement on your end. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This reflects a willingness to compromise from both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a fair deal.  While $975,000 is closer to a realistic price point, I need the number to be a bit higher.  How about $1,025,000?  This keeps us moving forward and acknowledges your willingness to compromise as well.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we are getting closer. To avoid further back and forth, I'm willing to make my final offer at $990,000. This represents a significant investment from my side and a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, and I understand this is a significant investment for you.  To be frank, though, anything under $1,000,000 is just too low for me to accept. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair one.  Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
