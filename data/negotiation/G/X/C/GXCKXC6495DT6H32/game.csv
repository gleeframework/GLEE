"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
