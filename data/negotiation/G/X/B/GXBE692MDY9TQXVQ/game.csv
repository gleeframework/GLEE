"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its value, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This price would be a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to finalize this deal at $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to invest in it without exceeding my financial constraints.  Let's make this deal happen.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $875,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our last offers. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
