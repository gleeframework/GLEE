Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** You're still aiming to pay $800,000 or less.

* **John is a safety net.** You have a backup option if negotiations with Alice fail.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $875,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our last offers. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your target, you're only willing to pay $800,000.
* **Negotiations are likely to continue.** It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $850,000.
* **John provides the best price.** He's willing to sell you the product for your maximum budget.

**Conclusion:** It's more advantageous to buy from John at $800,000 than to continue negotiating with Alice. You save $50,000 and avoid potentially prolonging the negotiations."
