"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, but I have to be honest with you, I've already received another offer from another buyer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000, but I need to make a decision soon. Is that something you're interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is using a common negotiation tactic to pressure you into accepting a less favorable deal.  Since you know John will sell the product for $8,000, there's no reason to pay more."
