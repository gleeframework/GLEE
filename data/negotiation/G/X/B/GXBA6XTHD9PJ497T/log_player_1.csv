Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will see value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept a price that is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is a compromise that is closer to my minimum value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price, given the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm not comfortable accepting a price this far below my minimum value.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm confident I can get a better price from John.  It's time to stop negotiating and move forward with the sale."
