Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested, I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000 for this product.  It's a significant investment for me, and this price point would allow us both to make a good deal.  What do you think?
