Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit above $8,000 in my valuation. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I'm not going any lower than that. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,250 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,250 and $8,500, so I'm counteroffering at $8,375. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $8,375 secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of the price increasing or missing out entirely."
