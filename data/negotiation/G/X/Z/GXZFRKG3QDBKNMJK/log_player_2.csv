"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I believe a price of $9,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, but $10,000 to you. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Alice's Offer:** $9,500 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and try to negotiate a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  My goal is to get the price as close to $8,000 as possible, which is Alice's value. 
* **Counter-Offer:** $8,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a good price for me. 
* **Negotiation:** This counter-offer shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and I can't go as low as $8,500. Would you consider $9,000? It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** While $9,000 is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my desired range.
* **Strategy:**  I'm still willing to negotiate further.  Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on her to come down in price.
* **Next Steps:** I'll send another counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still very interested in the product, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Offer:** I'm offering a price exactly halfway between my last offer of $8,500 and Alice's current offer of $9,000. This shows I'm serious about finding a compromise.
* **Fairness:**  By suggesting a middle ground, I'm emphasizing that I'm looking for a deal that benefits both of us.
* **Negotiation:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward without being overly aggressive."
