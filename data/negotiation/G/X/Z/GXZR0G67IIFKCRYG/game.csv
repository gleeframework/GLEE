"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  I believe its value speaks for itself, and to kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,500,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $1,100,000?  Let's try to get this done.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
