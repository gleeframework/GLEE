"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value while allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
