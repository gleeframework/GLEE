{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close, and it's important to remember that I have a backup option with John. It's risky to keep negotiating, and I might not get a better offer.  $960,000 is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale."
