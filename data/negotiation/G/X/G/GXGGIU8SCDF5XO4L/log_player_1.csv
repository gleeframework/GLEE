Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and this offer reflects that."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $20,000. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is still a significant discount from the market value. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches John's offer, and we know the product is worth no less than $15,000 to us. There's no guarantee of getting a better offer from Bob in further rounds, so it makes the most sense to sell to John now and secure the guaranteed $15,000."
