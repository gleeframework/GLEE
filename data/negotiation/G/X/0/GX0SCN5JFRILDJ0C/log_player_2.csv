{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you working with me, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm very close to my budget limit.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 12000}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $10,000.  He's already had a good negotiation with Alice, but he's reached his budget limit and it's getting very close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Alice has already rejected his last counteroffer, and it's not clear she's willing to come down any further. It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John, rather than risk Alice rejecting his next counteroffer and losing the opportunity to buy the product from either seller."
