Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000,  getting Bob to buy it at a slightly lower price still yields a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still being substantially higher than his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly."
