Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Our goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible, while staying above our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. It signals that we're serious about selling but also aiming for a strong profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives us a strong position. We're not desperate to sell below our minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while having a safety net in place with John's offer."
