I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, allowing room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll counter with a lower price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and move closer to his price point. Hopefully, this will encourage him to come up with a better offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. I believe further negotiation will be unlikely to result in a significantly better offer. It's better to secure this deal and avoid the risk of Bob rejecting further counteroffers or potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
