"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $850000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,780000.0
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $780000? It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price for this incredible product.",780000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $780000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $740000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me get this product without breaking the bank.",740000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the split-the-difference offer, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we go with $760000? It's still a compromise, but it's a bit more in line with my minimum price point.",760000.0,Alice,5,,
