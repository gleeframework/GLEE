**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm on getting a price above her product's value to her ($1,200,000).  While we could likely negotiate her down a little further, the difference is getting small enough that it's becoming risky. She might dig in, and we'd end up having to buy from John at the full $1,500,000. Accepting $1,260,000 secures a significant savings and avoids the risk of missing out on the deal entirely."
