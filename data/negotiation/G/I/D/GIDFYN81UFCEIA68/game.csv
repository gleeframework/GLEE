"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its unique features, I'm offering it at a starting price of $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has some nice features, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your initial offer, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept for this product. Its value is truly much higher. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I have a pretty firm budget in mind.  I could potentially stretch to $13,000, but that's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to make a final offer of $15,500. This is a really competitive price for something of this quality and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right this is a good product, but I need to be realistic with my budget.  I can offer $14,000, but I'm getting close to the point where I'll need to explore other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,
