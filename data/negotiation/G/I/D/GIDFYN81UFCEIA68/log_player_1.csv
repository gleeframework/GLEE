"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its unique features, I'm offering it at a starting price of $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and might give you a better understanding of Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $20,000, we're aiming to set a high anchor point. Even if Bob doesn't accept this price, it might make subsequent offers in the $15,000-$19,000 range seem more reasonable. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (""unique features"") adds perceived value, even if vague.

Let's see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has some nice features, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While we want to make a deal, accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. It's too early in the negotiation to settle for such a low price. We have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your initial offer, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept for this product. Its value is truly much higher. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:**  We're politely explaining why we can't accept Bob's offer without being overly negative. 
* **Compromise (Apparent):** Offering to ""meet in the middle"" sounds fair, even though our ""middle"" is still closer to our desired price.
* **Downward Movement:** We're signaling a willingness to negotiate by coming down from $20,000 to $17,000.  However, this is still a significant margin above Bob's offer, showing we're not desperate. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  We're reiterating that the product holds high value, hoping to nudge Bob closer to our target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I have a pretty firm budget in mind.  I could potentially stretch to $13,000, but that's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, $13,000 is still considerably less than our guaranteed sale to John at $15,000.  Bob's language (""firm budget,"" ""absolute maximum"") suggests he might be less flexible.  We need to signal that our price is also firm while encouraging him to move closer to a more acceptable range.  We'll proceed cautiously to see if we can negotiate further before falling back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to make a final offer of $15,500. This is a really competitive price for something of this quality and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** We're using language like ""final offer"" and ""significantly undervalues"" to indicate we're reaching our limit.
* **Slight Concession:**  We're lowering our price slightly, showing some flexibility, but staying above our guaranteed $15,000. 
* **Justification:** Reminding him about the product's quality reinforces its value.
* **Urgency:**  By presenting this as our ""final offer"" we're hoping to encourage Bob to make a decision and avoid prolonged haggling.

This is a critical point.  If Bob doesn't budge, we'll likely need to walk away and accept John's offer in the next round to avoid the risk of Bob not reaching our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right this is a good product, but I need to be realistic with my budget.  I can offer $14,000, but I'm getting close to the point where I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is finally within a reasonable range of our guaranteed $15,000 sale to John.  

* **Time Pressure:**  Bob's comment about exploring other options suggests we're reaching the end of his negotiating window.  Holding out further risks him walking away. 
* **Minimal Gain vs. Risk:** While we could try for a slightly higher price, the difference between $14,000 and $15,000 isn't substantial enough to risk losing the deal altogether. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially end up with nothing."
