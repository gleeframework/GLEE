Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go down to $8,500 as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you and my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.
