"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to go down to $12,500?  I believe that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,
