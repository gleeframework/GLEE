"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $900,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is still a fair price given the product's potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the potential benefits you'll realize and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's continue working towards a deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $850,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price point that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $825,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the potential value, and I believe it's a good starting point for a final agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
