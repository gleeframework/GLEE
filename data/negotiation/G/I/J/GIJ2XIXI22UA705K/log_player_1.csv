Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for your operations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) without going below my minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counter-offers. He might be willing to go a bit higher, especially if I can effectively communicate the product's value to him.
* **Strong Alternative:** I have a strong fallback option with John, who will pay my minimum price. This knowledge empowers me to be firm in my negotiations with Bob."
