"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the value you'll receive from the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll receive from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
