"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $11,000?  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750, which is a good compromise.  Let's meet in the middle on this one!",10750.0,Alice,5,
