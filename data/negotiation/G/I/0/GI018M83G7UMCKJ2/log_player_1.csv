Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $10,000 is still too low for me, and I want to see if we can get closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $11,000?  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4

# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is closer to what I want, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll see if I can push for a bit higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750, which is a good compromise.  Let's meet in the middle on this one!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
