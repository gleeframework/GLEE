Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}

This offer is a good starting point for a negotiation. It is significantly higher than John's offer, indicating that you are motivated to sell to Bob, but it also leaves some room for negotiation. This strategy maximizes your chances of getting a better price than John's offer while still remaining appealing to Bob, who values the product more."
