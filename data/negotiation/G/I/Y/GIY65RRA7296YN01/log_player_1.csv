Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $150. I believe it's a great value and will be very beneficial for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** By starting with a price higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, you leave room for negotiation and potentially maximizing your profit. 
* **Gauging interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest and invite a counter-offer. If he's very enthusiastic, he might accept the $150.
* **Backup plan:** You have a secured buyer (John) at $120, which is your minimum acceptable price. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
