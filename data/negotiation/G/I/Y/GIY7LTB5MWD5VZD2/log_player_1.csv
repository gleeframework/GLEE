Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can find a compromise closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $9,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with selling at that price.  I believe I can negotiate further with Bob and get a price closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm still not able to go below $9,000. This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident you'll find it invaluable. Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product is exceptional, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,750. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident that I can get a price closer to my minimum with Bob. It's getting very close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and while $8,750 is a decent offer, it's still significantly less than what John is willing to pay.  To ensure I get the best possible price for my product, I'm going to accept John's offer."
