"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a nice, round number that can be easily adjusted in future rounds.  I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still worth trying to get a bit more. Bob seems interested, and I have a few rounds left to push for a better price.  I can use this round to see if I can squeeze out a higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  How about $95? That's a good compromise and leaves some room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's offer. It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product. The message also emphasizes a compromise and a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $92? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, Bob's offer of $92 is within a reasonable range and leaves me with a decent profit. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and continuing to push might risk losing the sale altogether. It's better to accept the offer now and avoid the risk of a stalemate."
