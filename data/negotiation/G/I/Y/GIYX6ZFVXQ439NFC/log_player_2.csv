"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal. He can try to negotiate with Alice and potentially get the price lower.  Even if Alice rejects the counteroffer, Bob can still make a further counteroffer.  It's worth exploring this path before resorting to buying from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's a good compromise.  He wants to save as much money as possible while staying within his budget.  Offering $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum. This should open the door for further negotiation while still leaving room for Bob to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,800 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can likely still negotiate further. He's already proven willing to counter-offer, and Alice has shown some flexibility.  There's a good chance Bob can get closer to his ideal price with another counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has made a slight concession.  $9,500 represents a reasonable compromise that is still within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price.  This counter-offer demonstrates Bob's continued interest in buying the product while also pushing for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,600, which is only $400 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  This is a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price and still within his budget.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away outweighs the potential small savings.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking losing it."
