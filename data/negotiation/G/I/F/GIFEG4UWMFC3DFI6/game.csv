"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! The product looks great, but I was hoping to be closer to $600,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I can't quite meet you there. However, I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $750,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

"Hello Bob, I understand that $675,000 is a reasonable compromise, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.
