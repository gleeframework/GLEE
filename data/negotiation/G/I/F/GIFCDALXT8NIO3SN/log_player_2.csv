You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $500,000 is a very good price, but there's a lot of room for negotiation.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives you the chance to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $300,000 is a bold move, but it sets a strong starting point for haggling. If Alice rejects this, I'll have a better understanding of her price expectations and can adjust my offers accordingly."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $400,000 is still a decent price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to reject and counter again, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer to $350,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's last price.  I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if we can reach an agreement."
