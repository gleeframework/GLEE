"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't accept $800,000. It's significantly below the value of the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the product's worth and ensures a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
