"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm hoping to get closer to Bob's perceived value of $150. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go as low as $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$105 is getting closer to my minimum price of $80, but it's still not quite there. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a better price. There are still 6 rounds left, and I can always sell to John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $107.50. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to go as low as $102? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $102 is very close to my minimum price of $80, I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. There are only four rounds left, so I need to be careful not to sell to John prematurely. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $102 is still just a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for a final compromise: $104. I'm confident you'll find this a fair price, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 104}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still not satisfied with the price. Would you be willing to go as low as $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offer of $100 is now at my minimum acceptable price. There's a chance that he might reject my counteroffer in the next round and I'll be forced to sell to John for $80. It's better to accept his offer and ensure a sale."
