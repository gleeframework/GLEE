{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high point, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to maximize my profits while still enticing Bob to make a counteroffer.  If he rejects, I can then assess if a counteroffer from him is worth my time, or if I should just go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  While I'm open to negotiation, his initial offer is too far off. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a more agreeable price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $990,000? I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers.

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $990,000 is still below my target. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher."

# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,005,000? I'm willing to compromise and give you a bit more, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000.

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, accepting his offer will still result in a decent profit. I'm going to take the deal and sell to Bob."
