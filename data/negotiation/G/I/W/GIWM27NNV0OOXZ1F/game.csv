"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $990,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to work with you, but I need to be closer to $1,050,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,020,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
