Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on its quality and potential benefits, I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the value the product offers Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly states that I'm open to discussions and suggestions.

By doing this, I aim to get a good price while also keeping the negotiation process open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but  $13,000 is a bit more than I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?  That's the absolute maximum I can pay at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum than his initial rejection, it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a price closer to my ideal range. 
* **Risk of selling to John:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $10,000, it's less than what I can potentially get from Bob.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer to try and find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  Considering the value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and keeps the deal profitable for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:** My counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise and move towards Bob's price point while still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's worth, subtly suggesting that $12,000 is still a fair price for its benefits.
* **Win-Win Emphasis:** The message emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario, making it more likely that Bob will see this as a reasonable solution.

By adjusting my offer and focusing on a mutually beneficial outcome, I hope to encourage Bob to accept this counteroffer."
