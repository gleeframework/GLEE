"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but  $13,000 is a bit more than I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?  That's the absolute maximum I can pay at this time.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  Considering the value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and keeps the deal profitable for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
