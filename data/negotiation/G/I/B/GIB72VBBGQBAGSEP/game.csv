"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $9500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8750, which is a good middle ground. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $8750 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell for $8875. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",8875.0,Alice,5,
