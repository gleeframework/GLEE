"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where I'm willing to compromise a bit, but still aiming for a good price. It also sets a positive tone by emphasizing the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'll counter-offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $1,050,000 is a good starting point, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000,  which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still determined to get a better offer. I believe there's more room for negotiation, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,060,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,065,000. This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1065000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,065,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,060,000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. I hope you'll reconsider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a critical point. Bob's final offer is only $1,060,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  There's a good chance we could continue negotiating and reach a compromise, but the risk of losing the deal entirely is high. I'm confident that selling to John for $1,200,000 will guarantee me a profitable outcome and avoid potential losses."
