It's a good start! $750,000 is a decent discount, but Bob can likely do better. Let's see if we can squeeze out more savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I understand your budget constraints, but I must maintain the value of our product. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to adjust it slightly. My counteroffer is $725,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

While Alice is coming down in price, it's still a bit higher than Bob's ideal. Let's try to get a bit closer to his target with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $725,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $710,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 710000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

# Alice's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Bob. I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. My counteroffer is $707,500. Let's aim for a deal that satisfies both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $707,500.

Bob is getting a great deal here!  Alice is practically at his target price, and there's a good chance that further negotiation won't get him much lower. It's time to close the deal and save that money."
