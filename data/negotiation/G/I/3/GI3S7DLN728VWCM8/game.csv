"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to me.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $7,000.  Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
