"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $9,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John for $8,000, as it guarantees the lowest possible price within his budget.  Further negotiation with Alice risks a deadlock or a higher price, making John the more reliable option."
