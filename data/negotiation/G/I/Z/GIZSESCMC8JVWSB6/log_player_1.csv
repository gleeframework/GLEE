{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $135. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's valuation of the product, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This creates space for negotiation, allowing me to potentially secure a better price than John's offer while also leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're trying to find a good price. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $130? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
