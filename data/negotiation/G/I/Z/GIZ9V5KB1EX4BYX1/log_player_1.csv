Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a strategic balance:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're getting more than your floor price of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob is still getting a good deal at $50,000 less than his perceived value. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have some wiggle room to potentially raise the price.

By offering a price that's attractive to Bob while still securing a significant profit for you, you maximize your chances of a successful sale."
