"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. This product is worth a lot more.  I could consider $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $14,000.  This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to look elsewhere.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up.  I'm willing to compromise to close this deal quickly. How about we settle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I can only go up to $15,000.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close this deal now.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with another seller.",15000.0,Bob,6,
