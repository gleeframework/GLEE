"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Can you consider that price?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $100. Can you consider that price?",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $105. Can you consider that price?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to reach your target, but I'm still a bit uncomfortable with $105. I'm willing to go up to $102, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that price?",102.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $102, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $102 and $105, which would be $103.50. Can you consider that price?",103.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $103.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $101, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that price?",101.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer, which is $104. This is as high as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to sell it to you at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",104.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $104. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $120.",100.0,Bob,10,
