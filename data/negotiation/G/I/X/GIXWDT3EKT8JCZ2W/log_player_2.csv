"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  He should counteroffer Alice with a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I need to make a counteroffer. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's budget, and continuing to negotiate might not lead to a price lower than what John is offering."
