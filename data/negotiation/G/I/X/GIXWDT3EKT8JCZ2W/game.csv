"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me, and it allows us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I need to make a counteroffer. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
