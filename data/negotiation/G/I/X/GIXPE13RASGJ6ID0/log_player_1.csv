Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while still exceeding our minimum selling price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing our potential profit.  
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so we shouldn't go below that price with Bob."
