"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900000. I can offer you a compromise at $1050000, which is a bit higher than your counteroffer but still a significant discount from my initial price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. I can see you're serious about the product, and I'm willing to meet you a bit closer to your budget. I can offer you $1050000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $1025000? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $975000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where both of us can be happy with the deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $975000 is a bit too low for me. I can offer you a compromise at $1025000 again, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the next increment. How about we meet at $1012500? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",1012500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're really close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $990000 is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet.
