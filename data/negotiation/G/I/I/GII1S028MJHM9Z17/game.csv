"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000.  I'm open to discussing further, of course. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $22,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however, $10,000 is significantly below the market value of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $18,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering my budget and the current market situation, I am unable to agree to $18,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $15,000. I hope this might be closer to what we can mutually agree upon.",15000.0,Bob,4,
