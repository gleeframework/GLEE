Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000.  I'm open to discussing further, of course. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a price that's beneficial for you.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states openness to discussion, indicating that the initial price isn't a take-it-or-leave-it deal. 
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, there's a chance to earn significantly more from Bob. Starting at $22,000 allows for this potential upside."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $22,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below both our desired price and his perceived value of $8,000. While we want to negotiate, accepting this offer would be leaving a lot of money on the table. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however, $10,000 is significantly below the market value of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $18,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We significantly lowered our price from $22,000 to $18,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate. This approach might encourage Bob to make a more reasonable counteroffer closer to his perceived value of $8,000.
* **Highlighting Market Value:** By mentioning ""market value,"" we subtly remind Bob that his offer is significantly low, attempting to manage his expectations for further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While we are open to negotiation, we are not desperate. We are still aiming for a price that reflects the product's worth to us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering my budget and the current market situation, I am unable to agree to $18,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $15,000. I hope this might be closer to what we can mutually agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met our minimum acceptable price of $15,000, which matches what John is offering. There's no guarantee that further negotiation would result in a higher price from Bob. Accepting this offer secures the best possible outcome at this point."
