"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price is still well above my max budget, but it leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. To make this deal work, I'm offering $950,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows us to close this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $1,020,000 is still too steep for me. To make this a win-win, I'm offering $975,000. This price is a good compromise, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value and my budget. Let's finalize this deal!",975000.0,Bob,6,
