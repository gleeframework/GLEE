Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly less than my minimum value but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and inviting, aiming to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* This strategy balances my desire to maximize profit with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer and potentially leading to a counteroffer.  

I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  While it's tempting to accept, I'm aiming for a higher profit.
* **Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price.** There's a chance Bob may be willing to increase his offer if I reject his initial counteroffer.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than his initial offer, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about $11,500?  This price still allows you a good deal, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer higher than Bob's but lower than my minimum:**  This is a strategic move to show willingness to negotiate but also maintain my desired profit margin.
* **Positive and encouraging message:**  I'm highlighting the value Bob gets with the product and emphasizing the progress we're making towards a deal. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will either get Bob to accept or at least lead to a further counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my ideal profit margin. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation in hopes of securing a better deal.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob again, increasing the price slightly to test the waters and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer higher than Bob's:**  This shows I'm still willing to negotiate but not willing to accept his latest offer.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Middle ground approach:**  This approach is less aggressive than a big jump in price, potentially making Bob more likely to accept.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to agree to the price, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my expectations. 

To maximize my profit, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000. This guarantees me the highest possible price and avoids further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome."
