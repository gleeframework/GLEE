"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a fair price, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,200. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",10200.0,Bob,4,
