"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product! While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,200 is getting closer, I'm still not there yet.  To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to go up to $10,900.  It's a good price for me, and I think it reflects the value we're both placing on the product.",10900.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I hear you, and I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,100 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm making a final offer of $11,000. This reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",11000.0,Bob,8,
