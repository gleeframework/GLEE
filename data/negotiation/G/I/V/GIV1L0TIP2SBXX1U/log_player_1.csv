Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the quality and benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating. I have several rounds left and the option of selling to John for a higher price if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's reach a deal in this round, as I'm confident we can both be satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
