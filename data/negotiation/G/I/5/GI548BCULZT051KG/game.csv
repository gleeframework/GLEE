"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $80, which would be $85. Would you be interested in that price?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you consider that price?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you halfway between $85 and $78, which would be $81.50. Would you be interested in that price?",81.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $81.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $77 for the product. Can you consider that price?",77.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you halfway between $81.50 and $77, which would be $79.25. Would you be interested in that price?",79.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $79.25 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $76 for the product. Can you consider that price?",76.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you halfway between $79.25 and $76, which would be $77.625. Would you be interested in that price?",77.625,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $77.62 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",75.0,Bob,10,
