"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable meeting you in the middle at $6500. I'm willing to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. Let me know if this works for you!",7500.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm thinking $7000 is a fair price for this amazing product. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",7000.0,Alice,5,,
