"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in your product but I can only go up to $8000 right now.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $17000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $17000 is still a bit higher than I can realistically pay. I'm willing to offer $10000, let's meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to compromise further. Let's meet in the middle at $13500. This would be a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $12750.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best we can do at this point.  Let me know if this works for you.",12750.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $12000.  Let's finalize this deal now.  I really value your product, and I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,8,
