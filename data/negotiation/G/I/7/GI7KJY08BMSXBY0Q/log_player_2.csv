Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This feels like a fair compromise to ensure both of us benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I see you're serious about this purchase.  While $13,000 is still under what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $16,000. This is a firm offer, as I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.
