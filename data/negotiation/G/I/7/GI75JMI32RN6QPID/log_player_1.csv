I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's low offer, I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I believe there's still some room for negotiation.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I'm hoping it's attractive enough to convince Bob to come closer to my initial asking price."

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his initial offer, and I'm not willing to go lower.  I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,200,000. It's not the ideal outcome, but it's better than risking further negotiations with Bob."
