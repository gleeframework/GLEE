"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
