"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, and $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,150,000, which is $1,225,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
