Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  Offering $1,300,000 allows for a few rounds of counteroffers before I need to consider John's offer.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and encourages dialogue, making Bob more likely to engage in a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 I need to get.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob by making a counteroffer. There is a $200,000 gap between our current positions, which offers room for negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If further negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000.  This leaves us both with a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that is exactly in the middle of our current positions. This shows willingness to compromise and could make Bob more likely to accept.
* **High Enough:** $1,200,000 is still above Bob's offer but below my minimum, so it's a good starting point for a potential agreement.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing my offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us, highlighting the potential win-win scenario."
