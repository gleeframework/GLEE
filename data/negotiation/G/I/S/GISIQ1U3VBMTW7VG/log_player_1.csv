Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000. I believe it holds significant value and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $22,000, we ""anchor"" the negotiation higher. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers might be more favorable than if we started lower. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:** Remember, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000.  This knowledge gives us leverage and allows us to be more assertive in our negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Value:** Bob's counteroffer of $18,000 is still significantly higher than his perceived value of $10,000. This indicates there's room for further negotiation. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  We don't need to settle for $18,000 yet.  Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives us the confidence to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, the product is worth more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?"", ""product_price"": 20000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** We've come down from our initial price, signaling flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Concessions:**  A $2,000 reduction is significant enough to show we're serious about reaching a deal, but not so drastic that we appear desperate.
* **Targeting Above Bob's Value:**  We're still aiming for a price well above Bob's perceived value, maximizing potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $19,000, but no higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $19,000 is a significant profit over Bob's perceived value of $10,000 and well above John's offer of $15,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's unlikely to be a substantial amount. Further negotiation could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further back-and-forth and secures the profit.  Time spent negotiating could be used for other opportunities."
