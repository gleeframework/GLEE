"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) but lower than what I believe it's worth to me.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and optimistic to build a rapport with Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This gives Bob room to counteroffer, but also establishes a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I want to try to get a higher price, and there's still room to negotiate in the remaining rounds.  
* **Selling to John is an option:** I know I can sell to John for $150, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a little low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a great deal for a product like this. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation open and friendly.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer to make it seem reasonable and encourage Bob to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Higher:**  However, I'm still willing to gamble that I can get a slightly better offer in the next round. 
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $150 is still a viable option if I don't get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $140 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $145? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Fair Price:** I'm emphasizing that $145 is a fair price for both of us, making it sound like a good deal for Bob as well.
* **Finalizing the Deal:** I'm suggesting this is a good opportunity to finalize the deal, putting some pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John is always an option, I want to see if I can get a slightly better price from Bob before resorting to that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $135 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of Further Reduction:**  There's a high risk that Bob will continue to push for lower prices, and I'm worried I might end up selling it for less than I want.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation. 

At this point, it's better to secure a guaranteed profit with John than to risk getting a lower price from Bob."
