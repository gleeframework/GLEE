Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a safe $1,000,000, Bob's valuation of $1,500,000 presents a chance for higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain for Alice. This price point is also significantly below Bob's perceived value, making it an attractive proposition.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
