Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still making a profit. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. I'll also keep John's offer of $120 in mind as my floor price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is my floor price, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $135. This is a bit higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial price.  I'm hoping to split the difference and find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only slightly better than John's offer, it's still a profit and avoids further negotiation.  I'm not sure if I can get a better price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
