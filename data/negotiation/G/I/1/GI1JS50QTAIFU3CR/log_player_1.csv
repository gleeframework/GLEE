Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $600000. This reflects the value I see in the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
