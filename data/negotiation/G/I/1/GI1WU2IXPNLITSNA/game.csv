"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to make a significant investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000, which is a fair and competitive offer considering the product's value to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,250,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,125,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,125,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $1,150,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be honest, $1,150,000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this reflects a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is getting closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a price of $1,120,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1120000.0,Alice,7,
