"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident in the value of my product and want to see if Bob is seriously interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price and far below the value I place on the product. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the potential for Bob to make a profit. I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price and ensures I make a profit. It's also a decent deal for Bob, who can still make a profit on the product. While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I want to prioritize closing the deal now, especially with limited rounds remaining."
