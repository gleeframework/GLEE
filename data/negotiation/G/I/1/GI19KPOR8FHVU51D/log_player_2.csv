{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with my maximum budget. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying but am also firm about my price limit. If she rejects, we can continue negotiating within the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price. We have several rounds left, so there's still time to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm willing to compromise.  $900,000 is still below my limit, and it's closer to Alice's last offer. This could incentivize her to accept, but if not, we can keep negotiating."
