"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 
I'm going to start high, as I know the product is worth $100 to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I know the product is worth at least $100 to me. I want to see if I can get closer to that price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $95, which is closer to my minimum price of $100. While I'd love to get even more, I'm not sure I'll get a better offer from Bob, and I risk losing him entirely if I keep rejecting.  I'll take the $95 and move on."
