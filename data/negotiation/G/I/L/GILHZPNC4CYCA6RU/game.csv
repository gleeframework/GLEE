"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  I believe it's a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This would still give you a good deal and allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $100. This is the lowest I can go while still making a fair profit.  Let's finalize this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
