"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth is no less than $1200000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He has a guaranteed alternative from John for $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is higher.  While Alice might be willing to negotiate, there's no reason for Bob to risk paying more than he needs to."
