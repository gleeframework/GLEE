"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message upbeat and encouraging to maintain a good rapport with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** While $175 is above Bob's value, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could sell to him now, that would result in a significant loss. 

I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that is closer to my desired value.  I still have plenty of rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great price for a product with so much value. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping the price above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message respectful and open to negotiation, hoping to encourage Bob to come closer to my price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, hoping to justify my price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $120 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still not a good enough deal for me.  I would rather continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target. I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate, and I believe there's still room for a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Compromise:**  I'm still moving closer to Bob's price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not giving in completely.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a bit of urgency by suggesting this is a ""final"" offer, hoping to push Bob towards accepting.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify the price."
