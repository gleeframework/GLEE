{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you have an alternative seller (John) willing to sell the product for $120.  There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or get the product for your maximum price from John."
