Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This gives him some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $11,000, I can potentially negotiate a higher price if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm offering a price lower than John's offer ($12,000), but still high enough to ensure a good profit. This way, I can keep the option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. While I like the product, I'm only able to go up to $10500 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John guarantees a profit, but it's not the most favorable outcome. I'm still hopeful to get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer! I understand you're working within a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product. Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to work with Bob.
* **Keeping the Deal Alive:** By making a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation process going.
* **Still Profitable:** The price of $10,750 is above my minimum acceptable price and still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a bit too high at $10750, but I'm willing to go to $10600.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While a profit is still possible, it's becoming increasingly slim.
* **Time and Energy:**  Negotiations are taking longer than anticipated, and I'm not confident Bob will budge further.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me the highest profit and a faster transaction. The time and effort involved in further negotiations with Bob may not be worth the small potential increase in price.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a guaranteed profit and avoid further haggling."
