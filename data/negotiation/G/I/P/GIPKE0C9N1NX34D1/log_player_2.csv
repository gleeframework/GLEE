"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,100,000. It's a steal considering its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset.  Let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below her valuation, you can get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  There's no need to negotiate further with Alice since you have a better option readily available."
