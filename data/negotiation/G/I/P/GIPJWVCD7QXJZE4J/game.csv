"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I'm looking to acquire it at a more competitive price.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a competitive price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1350000. That's a good step in the right direction.  However, I'm still looking for a slightly lower price. To be fair, I'm willing to offer $1300000. This is a significant commitment for me, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a significant commitment. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $1325000.
