``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $12,000, but I'm also trying to be reasonable and encourage Bob to make a deal. I'll be ready to adjust the price based on his response and the possibility of dealing with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $8000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but I can't go as low as $8,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I am unable to meet you at $9000. I would like to stick to my original offer of $8000, which I believe is fair given the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get a higher price, Bob has clearly set his limit at $8,000. Continuing to negotiate with him risks going back and forth with no progress.  John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is much closer to my minimum value. It's time to move on and secure a better deal with John."
