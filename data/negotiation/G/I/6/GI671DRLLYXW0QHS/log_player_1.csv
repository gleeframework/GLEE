Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $7,500 is too low for me, even though it's better than selling to John. I'll try to get closer to my initial price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8,500. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,800. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800

While $7,800 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price of $9,000.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit short on budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,900. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900

I've been trying to get a better price from Bob, but it seems he's not budging.  While $7,900 is tempting, it's still lower than what I want. I'm going to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John, as it's a better deal for me at this point."
