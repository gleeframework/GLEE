"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message makes Bob feel valued and more likely to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the product's value helps justify the price.

This strategy aims to establish a strong initial position while keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.** 
* **I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to be patient and see if I can get closer to my desired price.**
* **Selling to John right now would be the most profitable option, but I want to explore if I can do better with Bob.**

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than his counteroffer. This will show I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. Let's meet halfway, and I think we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,000.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm framing it as a ""meeting halfway"" scenario to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $9,000 is still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer.

**Strategy:**

I believe this counteroffer strikes a balance between maintaining my desired profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. I'm optimistic that we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the next few rounds."
