Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your starting price is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay at this time.  Given my research and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering our respective needs and the market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Let's work together to bridge this gap.
