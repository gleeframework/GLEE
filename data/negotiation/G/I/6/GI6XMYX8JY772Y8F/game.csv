"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your starting price is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay at this time.  Given my research and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering our respective needs and the market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's inherent worth and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This adjustment reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our respective needs. Let's work together to bridge this gap.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $1,600,000 for this product.  It's truly a unique offering, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I believe this revised price represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
