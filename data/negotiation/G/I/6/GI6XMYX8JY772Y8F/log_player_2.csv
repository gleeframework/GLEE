"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is far above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting her offer allows you to start a negotiation process. You will be able to counter-offer and potentially reach a price you're comfortable with.  Buying from John immediately would be the best option if you were satisfied with the product from John, but since you are negotiating with Alice, you should continue the negotiation process."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your starting price is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay at this time.  Given my research and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering our respective needs and the market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's inherent worth and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This adjustment reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget of $1,200,000.  You're better off continuing the negotiation process. You can counter-offer again and try to reach a price closer to your maximum limit. Buying from John immediately would be the best option if you were satisfied with the product from John, but since you are negotiating with Alice, you should continue the negotiation process."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our respective needs. Let's work together to bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $1,600,000 for this product.  It's truly a unique offering, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I believe this revised price represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While continuing the negotiation process is possible, it's unlikely that you'll be able to get her down to your desired price.  Since John is willing to sell you the product for your maximum limit, it's more advantageous to purchase it from him. You'll save a significant amount of money and avoid further negotiation."
