{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly below its market value. I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is strategic for the following reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.**  This gives him incentive to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting. 
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price.**  This gives you some wiggle room to make counteroffers if Bob rejects.
* **The message is friendly and encourages a positive response.**  This helps build rapport and increase the likelihood of Bob engaging in the negotiation. 

I'm aiming to maximize profit while still keeping the negotiation open and ensuring a potential deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer would be a huge loss for me. 

While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product at such a low price. I will proceed with a counteroffer in the next round to try and find a price that is more beneficial for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still offers you a significant value considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer:** This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message is still friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob:**  This helps maintain a positive tone and encourages further negotiation.
* **Price is closer to my minimum acceptable price:** It provides a better starting point for further negotiations while still leaving room for potential compromises.

I believe this counteroffer will push Bob to reconsider his initial offer while still maintaining a positive and collaborative negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept such a substantial loss.

Considering the fact that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price, it's more advantageous for me to sell the product to John. This ensures that I get the best possible price and avoid any further negotiation with Bob that may result in a price lower than my minimum acceptable price."
