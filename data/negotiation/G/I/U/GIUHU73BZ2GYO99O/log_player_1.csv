Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to the true value Bob sees in the product.  I'll be ready to counter-offer if he rejects this initial price."

Bob's offer is closer to my value, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can get a better price, so I'll reject his offer and counter-offer."

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to his offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a higher price than John's $1,000,000, but I'm also willing to consider Bob's perspective."
