Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,080,000 undervalues its potential.  Would you consider $1,120,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced that $1,120,000 is the right price.
