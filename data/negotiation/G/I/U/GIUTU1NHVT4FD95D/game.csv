"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1080000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,080,000 undervalues its potential.  Would you consider $1,120,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced that $1,120,000 is the right price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,080,000, but I'd like to propose a compromise: $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
