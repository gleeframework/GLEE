"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,450,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects its worth. Would you consider $1,400,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and sees the value.  While $1,350,000 is a good offer, I'm aiming to get as close to $1,400,000 as possible. It's still early in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,375,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value."", 
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,375,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my last offer of $1,350,000. This price is fair given the product's value and my financial limitations.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is holding firm at $1,350,000 and has indicated this is his final offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, we're getting close to the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Accepting now secures a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to push risks losing Bob altogether."
