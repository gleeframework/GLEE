Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,450,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects its worth. Would you consider $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,375,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.
