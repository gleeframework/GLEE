"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to meet you halfway. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it shows my commitment to making this happen. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $11,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $10,500. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might reject further counteroffers and I might end up selling to John for $10,000.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a slightly higher price and avoids the risk of a stalemate."
