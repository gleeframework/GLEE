"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to meet you halfway. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it shows my commitment to making this happen. Let's find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $11,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $10,500. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
