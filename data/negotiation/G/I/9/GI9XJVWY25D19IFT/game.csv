"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm ready to purchase the product if you can come down to $10750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm thinking we can meet in the middle at $11250, but I'm willing to compromise on that. Let me try one last time to meet you at $11000.",11000.0,Alice,7,
