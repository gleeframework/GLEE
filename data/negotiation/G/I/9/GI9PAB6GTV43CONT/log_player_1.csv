"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to see if he's willing to pay more than expected.  It also sets the stage for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than what he initially offered, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counter-offering with $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer and closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident that I can get a better offer in the next round, and I want to avoid selling to John for $100 if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 102}
```

I'm counter-offering with $102.  This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum threshold.  This also shows Bob that I'm serious about wanting to close the deal and avoid selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below my initial goal, it's a good compromise and above my minimum acceptable price. It's also getting very close to what John is willing to pay, and I want to avoid selling to John if possible.  With only a few rounds left, it's a good time to close the deal and get the sale finalized."
