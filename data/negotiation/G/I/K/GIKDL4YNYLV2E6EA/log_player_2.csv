"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special price of $135. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I think this is a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $135 is cheaper than buying from John for $150.
* While the product is worth $120 to Alice, it's worth $150 to you, so any price below $150 is a good deal."
