Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special price of $135. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I think this is a fair deal. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Finding a middle ground:** Offering the product for $135 is a compromise between your minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($150). This gives you a good chance of securing a deal while still maximizing your profit. 
* **Alternative buyer:** You have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $120. This knowledge allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob."
