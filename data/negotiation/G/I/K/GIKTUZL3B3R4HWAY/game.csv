"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. Let me know if you're interested.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little hesitant. Could we agree on $775,000? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. Let me know if you're interested.",825000.0,Alice,5,
