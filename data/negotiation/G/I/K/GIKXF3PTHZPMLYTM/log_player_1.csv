Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob and using positive language to encourage a sale. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and decide whether to:

* **Accept his counteroffer:** If it's close to my desired price, I'll accept to close the deal.
* **Counteroffer:** If his offer is too low, I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Sell to John:** If the negotiation stalls or Bob's offers are too low, I'll move on and sell to John for $150 to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even significantly lower than my initial offer of $130. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, but still keeping in mind that I have a fallback option of selling to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This is a great product, and I believe it's worth the price."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $60. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive Language:** Using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""great product"" promotes a sense of collaboration and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response and decide whether to:

* **Accept his counteroffer:** If he comes closer to $90, I'll consider accepting.
* **Counteroffer:** If his offer is still significantly lower, I'll counteroffer again, perhaps by reducing my price slightly.
* **Sell to John:** If the negotiation drags on or Bob's offers remain too low, I'll sell to John for $150 to secure a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I have a strict budget.  Could you do $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for me.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a price that is higher than $75 but also acknowledges his budget constraint. I will strive to find a compromise that works for both of us.  However, I will keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $150, giving me a safety net in case the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you about the budget. Let's try $85.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this excellent product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer of $75, but still above his initial offer of $60. This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm willing to negotiate further, but also setting a limit with the phrase ""but I need to make sure I get a fair price.""

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response and decide whether to:

* **Accept his counteroffer:** If Bob accepts $85 or makes a counteroffer close to it, I'll accept to close the deal.
* **Counteroffer:** If Bob's offer is still too low, I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting close to my minimum price of $150. 
* **Sell to John:** If the negotiation continues to stall or if Bob's offers remain too low, I'll sell to John for $150 to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
