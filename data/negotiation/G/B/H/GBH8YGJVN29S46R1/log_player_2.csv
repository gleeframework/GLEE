# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $800000. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $725,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm eager to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $750000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is within your budget and a good price considering the initial offer.  There's a chance you could get it lower, but the risk of going back and forth further increases the likelihood of Alice sticking to her current price or even going up.  It's better to take the offer and secure the product."
