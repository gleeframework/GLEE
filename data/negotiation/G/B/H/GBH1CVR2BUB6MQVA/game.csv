"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I am still looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product for $1,000,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still significantly below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still committed to staying within my budget. Could we possibly agree on a price closer to $950,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
