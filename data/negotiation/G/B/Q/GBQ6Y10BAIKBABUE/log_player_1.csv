Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $115.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value for the product. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm unable to go down to $90.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? This is a fair price for both of us, and ensures I can still make a decent profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 isn't quite enough for me to cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is my absolute bottom line. This ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're able to agree to that."", ""product_price"": 100}
