""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product at a price of $19,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I truly believe in the value of this product and I am certain it will be highly beneficial for you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes it more likely to secure a price closer to your desired range. 
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the product's benefits to Bob helps justify the price, even if it's higher than his initial perceived value.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives you leverage. It allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob, as you're not desperate for the sale.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While this offer maximizes potential profit, it's crucial to consider Bob's likely reaction. A significantly higher price than his perceived value might discourage him entirely.
* **Relationship Building:**  If building a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive opening offer might be more suitable.

This initial offer is a starting point. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your negotiation skills."
