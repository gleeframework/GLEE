Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I think this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's room for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling pressured to accept a significantly lower price. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** This approach balances the risk of Bob rejecting my offer with the potential for earning a high price. If he rejects, I can still negotiate further or sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
