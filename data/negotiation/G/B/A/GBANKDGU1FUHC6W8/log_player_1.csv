Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $900,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point. I'm ready to offer $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
