"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $900,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point. I'm ready to offer $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.",875000.0,Alice,3,
