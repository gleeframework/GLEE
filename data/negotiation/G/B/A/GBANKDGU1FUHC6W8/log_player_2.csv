"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth exploring negotiation to see if a lower price can be reached.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $900,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point. I'm ready to offer $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  Bob is trying to bridge the gap between Alice's offer and his ideal price.  $850,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still a profitable deal for her. 
* **Message Tone:** The message remains polite and focuses on a ""mutually beneficial"" outcome. This helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being a fair price for me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price Point:** Alice's offer of $875,000 is a significant drop from her initial offer and is within Bob's budget. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** This offer represents progress in the negotiation, and further counter-offers may risk pushing Alice to a point where she's unwilling to sell. 
* **Alternative Cost:** Buying from John for $1,000,000 would be more expensive, making Alice's offer the most financially beneficial option."
