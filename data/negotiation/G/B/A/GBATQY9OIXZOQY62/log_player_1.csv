Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer message:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase [product name]. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This offer stands until [date/time], after which I'll be moving forward with another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming High:**  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting with a price of $1,150,000 allows for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Deadline Creates Urgency:** Setting a deadline encourages Bob to act quickly and prevents prolonged negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you don't explicitly mention John, the deadline implies you have other options, subtly increasing the offer's perceived value. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy. You could:

* **Start higher:**  Push for an even larger profit by initially offering a price closer to $1,200,000.
* **Offer a payment plan:** If upfront payment is an issue,  proposing installments might make the deal more appealing to Bob. 

The best approach depends on your negotiation style and how much risk you're comfortable taking."
