Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming to maximize my profit.  $175 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly message can build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard limit, so I can adjust if necessary. 
* **The $150 safety net:** I know I can sell to John for $150, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob won't meet a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **The $150 safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $150, so there's no risk in continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer is halfway between my original offer of $175 and Bob's offer of $80. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive message:**  I maintain a friendly tone, reminding Bob of his interest and encouraging further negotiation.
* **Still above minimum:**  $120 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for flexibility:**  While I've lowered my price, I'm not fully committed. There's still room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $92 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful:**  Bob's offers are getting increasingly closer to his perceived value of $100, indicating he's unlikely to go much higher. 
* **Guarantee profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $150, which is more than Bob's current offer. 
* **Time is valuable:** Continued negotiation could be time-consuming and ultimately unproductive. 

By selling to John, I ensure a profitable outcome and avoid the risk of further negotiation that may not lead to a better deal."
