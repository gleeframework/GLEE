"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you.  I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.

Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and purchase from John."
