"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, and I know it can be equally valuable to you.  My initial price is $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects the product's value while leaving room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's significantly higher than his maximum budget, and there's room for negotiation.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems interesting, but your initial price is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum selling point. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000.  This price still reflects the significant value of the product, but it's also closer to your budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price point. Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating for a lower price. There's still room for both parties to come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering your value and my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too far from what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the product's value and gives us both a fair deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is his maximum budget and the price John is selling for. It's a good deal for both parties."
