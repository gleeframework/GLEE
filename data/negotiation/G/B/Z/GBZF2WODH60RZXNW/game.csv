"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, and I know it can be equally valuable to you.  My initial price is $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects the product's value while leaving room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but your initial price is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum selling point. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000.  This price still reflects the significant value of the product, but it's also closer to your budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering your value and my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too far from what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the product's value and gives us both a fair deal. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,5,
