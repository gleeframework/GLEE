Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $13,000 is less than Bob's estimated value of $15,000, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can potentially go higher if Bob counteroffers. 

Remember, the goal is to get as close to Bob's value as possible without risking a sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, we can still do better.  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer gives us the opportunity to counter and try to push the price closer to our desired $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would still be a great price for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```
 
This counteroffer offers:

* **A compromise:** It's right in the middle of your previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **An appeal to logic:**  It emphasizes the fairness of meeting in the middle.
* **A positive frame:**  It highlights the benefit for both of you.

We're now closer to our goal of $13,000, but still leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
