{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $110 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  While Bob has tried to negotiate a lower price, it seems like Alice is not willing to budge significantly. Given that Bob can buy the product from John for $80, it's more beneficial for Bob to stop negotiating with Alice and purchase the product from John."
