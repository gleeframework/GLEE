Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $12,000 to me and $8,000 to him. It leaves room for negotiation but still allows me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I can still try to get more.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's $1,000 more than his original offer. However, it's also a significant step closer to my ideal price, and it leaves room for potential compromise if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is getting too close to what the product is worth to him.  It's not worth risking further negotiation at this point.  Selling to John guarantees me the full value of the product."
