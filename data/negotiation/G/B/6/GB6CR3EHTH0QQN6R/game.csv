"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $1100000 is a more reasonable price. It's a fair middle ground, considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not convinced that $950000 is a fair price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $1050000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
