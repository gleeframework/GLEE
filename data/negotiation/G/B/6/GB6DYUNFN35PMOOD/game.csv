"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?,107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about we try $110?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll get us closer to finalizing the deal. ",110.0,Alice,5,
