"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, there's no potential for saving money by negotiating.  Buying from John immediately guarantees the product for the maximum price Bob is willing to pay."
