"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $160. I believe it's a fair price considering its quality and value."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the quality and value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is offering the maximum he's willing to pay, and it's less than what John is offering. There's no point in further negotiation."
