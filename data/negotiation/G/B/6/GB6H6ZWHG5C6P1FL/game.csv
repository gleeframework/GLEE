"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I am willing to consider $9,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the product's worth.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This shows my commitment to acquiring your product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
