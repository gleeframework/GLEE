Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel valued and more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the product's value to make Bob consider its worth.

This strategy aims to create a good starting point for the negotiation while keeping in mind that I have a fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.** While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that's below my floor.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Although Bob's offer is too low, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get a better price from Bob. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price that's closer to my desired value, which will hopefully lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! While I appreciate your offer, $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer bridges the gap between Bob's offer ($100) and my minimum ($120). This shows willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that $130 is still a good deal for him. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's split the difference and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for Loss:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counter, I risk him walking away completely. 
* **Time Factor:**  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing time.

While it's not my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical decision at this point.  It allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of a prolonged negotiation or losing out on John's offer."
