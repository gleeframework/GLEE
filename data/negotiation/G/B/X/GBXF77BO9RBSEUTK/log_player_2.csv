"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product for a competitive price. Given its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits and returns you'll gain from owning this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob than buying from John.** Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000. This means Bob can save $300,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* **Even though Alice's offer is above her own valuation ($800,000), it's still a good deal for Bob.**  He's still getting a significant discount from his own perceived value."
