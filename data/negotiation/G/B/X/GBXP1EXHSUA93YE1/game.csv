"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I know you'll find immense value in it. To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I do see value in the product, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. To be honest, $1,800,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $1,400,000?  That feels like a good compromise to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is pushing the lower limits of what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,450,000. I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
