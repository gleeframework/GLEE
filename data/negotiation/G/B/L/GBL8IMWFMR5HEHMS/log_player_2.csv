"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on a product worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in moving forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can secure the product from John for $1,000,000, saving himself $200,000."
