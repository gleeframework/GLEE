"I have a unique and valuable product that I'm excited to offer to you. I believe it's worth considering at a price of $12,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both parties.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to reaching a deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I think my initial price of $12,000 was a fair starting point. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $11,250.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $10,750. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come away satisfied.  If we can agree on this, we can finalize the purchase.",10750.0,Bob,6,
