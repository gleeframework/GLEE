Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking to negotiate a price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000, which would be $800,000. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit and offer it to you for $825,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate that.  $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like.  How about we settle this right now at $780,000?  This saves us both time and gets the deal done."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm offering the product to you for $795,000. This is the closest I'm willing to get to your offer, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
