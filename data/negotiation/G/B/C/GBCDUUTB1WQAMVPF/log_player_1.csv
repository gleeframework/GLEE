Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate and allows me to gauge his interest. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still do better.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer of my own in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a compromise between his offer of $900,000 and my previous offer of $1,000,000.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price of $1,200,000, Bob's offer of $925,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Further negotiation might not yield much more, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting his offer is the most sensible decision at this point."
