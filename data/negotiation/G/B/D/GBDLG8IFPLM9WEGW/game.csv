"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I can't do $90, I could come down to $110.  This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $90, so I'll offer $95 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
