"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

This is a very competitive price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I see the value in the product, $825,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you consider $750,000?  That would make it a more viable option for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
