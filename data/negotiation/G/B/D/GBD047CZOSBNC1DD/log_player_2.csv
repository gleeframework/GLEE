"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I believe this price is still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit of $8,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me and your willingness to negotiate.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to sell it for $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $10,000, which is the price John is willing to pay. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. I hope you can understand my position. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above my budget, and I've already made several counteroffers.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to budge much further.  I'm better off buying the product from John for $8,000, as it's the best deal I can get within my budget."
