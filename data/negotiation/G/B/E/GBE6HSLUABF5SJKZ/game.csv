"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $12,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's the best compromise we can reach. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
