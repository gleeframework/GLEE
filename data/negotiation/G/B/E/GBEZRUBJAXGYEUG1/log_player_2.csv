"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. There are 9 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample time to try and push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but not so low as to be immediately insulting. This signals his intention to negotiate and find a fair price. 
* **Focused on the value to Bob:** Bob highlights that $8,500 is still a good deal for him, acknowledging that the product is valuable. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  This counteroffer gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling like she has to accept a drastically low price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $9,250?  That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is a lower price than Alice's first offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. He has already successfully negotiated down the price, and there are 7 rounds remaining to potentially squeeze out even more savings.  Rejection opens the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about $9,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant step:** Bob is making a smaller counteroffer this time, showing he's willing to compromise but still trying to get the best possible price.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** Bob reiterates that his offer is fair, focusing on mutual benefit.
* **Maintaining the negotiating momentum:** Bob is keeping the pressure on Alice to make a deal, with the clock ticking down on the number of rounds."
