"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it's also a significant reduction from your initial offer. Let's try to reach an agreement here.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
