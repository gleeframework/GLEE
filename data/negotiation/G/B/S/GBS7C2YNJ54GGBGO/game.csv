"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do it for $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $7,000. Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit above $7,000. I'm willing to compromise again and sell it to you for $8,200. It's a great value, and I think you'll be happy with the price!",8200.0,Alice,5,
