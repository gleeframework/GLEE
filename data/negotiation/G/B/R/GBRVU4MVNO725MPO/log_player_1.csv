Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers. I believe it's important to start high to see if there's any potential for a higher sale price.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate but I won't go below my minimum value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, so I cannot accept it. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is still higher than my minimum value of $1,500,000 but is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. I believe this price is still fair while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still below my minimum value. While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems unlikely that he'll go much higher. To avoid further rounds of potentially unsuccessful negotiations, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I get at least my minimum value."
