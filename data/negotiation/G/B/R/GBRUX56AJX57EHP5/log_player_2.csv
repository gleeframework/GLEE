"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price that I think is fair. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $650,000 for it."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:** While I'm starting low, I want to maintain a polite and professional tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Justification:** Offering a specific reason (""a bit high for me"") can make my counteroffer seem more legitimate and less arbitrary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's in the middle of what I was originally asking and what you're offering. How about $825,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still too high. We started significantly lower than her asking price for a reason. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about a lower price and force her to consider a bigger concession."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle on $725,000? I think that's a fair price that considers both of our positions."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the Negotiation:** We're getting closer to a price that might work, so it's worth continuing the negotiation.
* **Incremental Increases:** Rather than jumping up significantly from our last offer, we're making a smaller increase to show we're willing to compromise but still want a good deal.
* **Seeking a Middle Ground:** This offer aims for a point closer to the middle of our previous offers, encouraging Alice to do the same. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone encourages a collaborative approach to the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet with $725,000, but I'm willing to meet you closer to that number. How about we aim for $775,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Close:** At $775,000, we're getting very close to a price that's significantly below John's offer and a good deal for us.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only result in small concessions from Alice at this point. It's unlikely we'll get a price significantly lower than $775,000. 
* **Time Value:**  Each round of negotiation takes time. Accepting now secures a good price and allows us to move forward."
