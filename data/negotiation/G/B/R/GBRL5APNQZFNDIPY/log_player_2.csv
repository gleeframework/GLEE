{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $750,000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 750000}

This still reflects its true value and provides a good balance between the cost and the benefits it offers to your business.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. While $825,000 is closer to my target, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product.
