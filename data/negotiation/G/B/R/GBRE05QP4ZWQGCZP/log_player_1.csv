Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price, while still being competitive. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to buy, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he doesn't come up to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit lower than I'd like, but it's getting close.  I'm going to accept his offer. It's better than selling to John for $150, and I don't want to risk losing this sale altogether."
