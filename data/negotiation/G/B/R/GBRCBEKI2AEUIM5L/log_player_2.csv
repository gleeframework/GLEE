"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since both Alice and John are selling the product for the same price ($1,500,000), it doesn't make a difference who you buy from. You will pay the same amount either way."
