"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, the product is worth a lot to me, and I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that's still a bit too steep for me.  How about $700,000?  That's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is as low as I can go, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",950000.0,Alice,5,
