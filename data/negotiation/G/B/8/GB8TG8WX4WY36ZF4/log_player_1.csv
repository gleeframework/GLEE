"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what I need to get for the product. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $8,500 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $8,500, which would be $9,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my ideal price, I still believe I can get a bit more. I'm not desperate to sell and John is a backup option that guarantees me my minimum desired price. I'll see if I can push Bob a little further in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to be at least $9,125 to make this work. This price still leaves some room for you to get a good deal, and it ensures I'm able to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9,125 is a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 was a bit of a stretch, so I'll try to meet you in the middle from $9,125, which would be $9,062.50. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,062.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,062.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,062.5 is getting closer to what I want, I still think I can get a better price. I'm not in a rush to sell, and I have the option to sell to John for a higher price if I need to. I'll try to convince Bob to come up just a little bit more in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that we're close, but I need to be at $9,100 to make this work. This is a fair price that considers the value of the product and lets us both walk away happy. It's just a small adjustment from your last offer, and it shows you're serious about closing this deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9100}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm close to a deal with Bob,  I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether. John guarantees me my minimum desired price, and I'm not willing to risk further haggling with Bob, especially with only a few rounds left."
