Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $800,000, Bob values it much higher. Our goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle on a price significantly higher than our fallback option of $800,000.
* **Strategic Communication:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and Bob's privileged position as the first recipient of the offer."
