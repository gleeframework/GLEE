Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about meeting halfway at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your enthusiasm."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get the best price for your product, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm still only able to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement at that price.

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and it's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than risk a lower final offer from Bob."
