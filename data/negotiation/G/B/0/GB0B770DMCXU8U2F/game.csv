"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about we split the difference?  $10,250 seems fair to me. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $10,250 is closer, it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me in the middle. Let's try one more time - how about $9,750?  I'm really hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close! $9,750 is tempting, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,600.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",9600.0,Bob,6,
