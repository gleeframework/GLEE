Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation and still gives me a significant profit.
* **Benefit for Bob:**  $120 is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $150 to him. 
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I have room to negotiate down, but I also have the option of selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to do $100? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $100 is better than John's $80 offer, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. He's already expressed interest, and he's willing to pay more than John.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap between our desired prices.
* **Risk Mitigation:** If Bob refuses my counteroffer, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $100.  How about $110? That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a good value on the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer of $110 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer of $120 and his offer of $100. 
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  $110 still allows me to make a significant profit while remaining competitive.
* **Encouraging Agreement:**  The message emphasizes fairness and value, making it more likely Bob will accept."
