,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $90?  That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable paying $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90. How about $87.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",87.5,Bob,6,
