"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. Considering my budget and the current market situation, I would like to propose a price of $1500000 for the product.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1500000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  I need to receive at least $1750000 for this product.  This price still allows for a good margin for you, and reflects the product's real value. Let's find a middle ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline the $1750000 offer. I am still seeking a price closer to my initial proposal. Based on my research and understanding of the market, I would like to counter with an offer of $1600000 for the product.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
