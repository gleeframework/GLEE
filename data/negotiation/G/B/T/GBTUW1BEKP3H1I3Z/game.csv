"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to my original offer. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1250000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial price, and hopefully, it's a reasonable figure for you as well.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
