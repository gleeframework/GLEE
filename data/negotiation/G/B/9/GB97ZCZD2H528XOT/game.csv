"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we value your business, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $8,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was looking for. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $8,200 is closer, it's still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a new offer of $8,100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and the original price I was looking for. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this.  $8,100 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $7,800?  I think that's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to get the product from you.",7800.0,Bob,6,
