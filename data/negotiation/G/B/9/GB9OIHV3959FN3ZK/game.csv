"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident the product is valuable, but I'm only willing to pay $750,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
