"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to be mindful of my expenses.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to propose a price of $920,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",920000.0,Bob,4,
