"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on it.  I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $12500?  This price still allows you to get a great deal, while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.",12500.0,Alice,3,
