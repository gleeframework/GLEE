Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""fair price,"" Alice subtly anchors the price in Bob's mind, even though she hasn't explicitly stated the product's worth to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the lines of communication open.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with negotiation and potentially having her initial offer rejected.
* It's crucial to gauge Bob's interest and adjust the approach if necessary. If Bob seems turned off by the high price, Alice can always pivot to a more competitive offer."
