"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while also giving you a significant profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth to both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to profit. Let's continue the conversation.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell it to you for $1,200,000, but this is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
