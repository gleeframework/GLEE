Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A price of $2,000,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It shows you're willing to discuss while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Strong value proposition:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value,"" subtly anchoring Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay the product's actual value."
