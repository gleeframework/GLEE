"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm starting the price at $22,000.  I believe it will be a valuable asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's clearly not a good deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to enter a negotiation and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $22,000 is well outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price, making it clear I'm serious about buying, but also leaving room for negotiation. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also not going to be unreasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your initial offer, but $22,000 is significantly less than my bottom line.  To make this work, I can come down to $18,000. I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $18,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum budget.  Rejecting her offer again keeps the negotiation open and allows me to try to get a better price. It's unlikely she'll go all the way down to my initial offer, but there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but I don't think I can go higher.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by $2,000, showing I'm willing to compromise but still maintaining a reasonable distance from her price. This keeps the negotiation moving forward, while also establishing a clearer range for potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I'm motivated to find a fair deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if I can push her closer to my target. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, and I'm glad we're getting closer. However, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by only $2,000. This signals that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not willing to go much higher.  I'm hoping that this offer will be close enough to Alice's bottom line to entice her to accept."
