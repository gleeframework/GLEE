"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm starting the price at $22,000.  I believe it will be a valuable asset to you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $22,000 is well outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your initial offer, but $22,000 is significantly less than my bottom line.  To make this work, I can come down to $18,000. I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but I don't think I can go higher.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I'm motivated to find a fair deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, and I'm glad we're getting closer. However, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,6,
