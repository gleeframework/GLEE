Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This reflects the fair market value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.
