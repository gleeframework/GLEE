"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my usual asking price and above your estimated value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below her usual asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $10,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can secure the product from John for $10,000, saving $2,000."
