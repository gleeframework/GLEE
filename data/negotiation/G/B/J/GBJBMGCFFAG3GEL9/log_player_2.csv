Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has shown she's not willing to go lower than $117. This is higher than Bob's maximum price of $120.  It's better for Bob to buy the product from John at $120 than to continue negotiating with Alice and risk a higher price or a stalemate."
