"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,700,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point given the value of the product to Bob.  I'll see if he's willing to negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to make at least $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair offer and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable, and I'm worried that we won't reach an agreement in time. I'm going to sell to John, who is offering my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not comfortable risking losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
