"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500.
