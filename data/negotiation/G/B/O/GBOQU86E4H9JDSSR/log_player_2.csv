{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now.

While you'd still love to save a bit more, you've already been through several rounds of negotiations. Alice isn't budging much further, and you risk losing out on the deal altogether if you keep rejecting.  Accepting $11,500 is a good compromise, saving you $3,500 compared to John."
