"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $11,000. I believe this product will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $11,000.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  You should counteroffer to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm not sure I can go that high.  Would you be willing to do $9,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is a good deal. It's less than your initial maximum price of $12,000 and you're getting a good product. It's likely that Alice won't go lower, so it's better to accept the offer than to risk a further negotiation."
