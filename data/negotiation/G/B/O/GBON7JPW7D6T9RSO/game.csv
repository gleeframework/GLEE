"I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"That price is much too high for me. I'm interested, but only if you're willing to come down significantly.  How about $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is still a good value for you, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"We're getting closer, but $10,000 is still more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see we're close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise at $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
