"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire [Product Name] for a price of $1500000. This product holds significant value and I believe it has the potential to generate substantial returns for you. However, if you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1200000. So, this is a chance to secure a potentially valuable asset at a price that reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to pressure Bob into accepting the offer by mentioning a higher price from another buyer. However, Bob knows he can get the product from John for the same price. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy as it doesn't cost Bob anything and allows him to explore other options."
