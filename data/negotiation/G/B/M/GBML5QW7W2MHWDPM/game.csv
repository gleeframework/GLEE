"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't quite accept that price. How about we settle at $1,075,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of the product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
