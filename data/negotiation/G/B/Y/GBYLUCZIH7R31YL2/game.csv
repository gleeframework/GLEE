"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $100 is still a bit too high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $90.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $95 for the product? This is slightly above your offer but still reasonable considering the value it holds for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
