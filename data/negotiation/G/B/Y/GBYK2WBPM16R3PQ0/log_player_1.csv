Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bargain you down.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value will help you gauge his interest level. If he's immediately turned off, you know he's very price-sensitive. If he counters, it means he's potentially willing to pay more than $100.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so there's less risk in starting high with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. Depending on your negotiation style and your read on Bob, you might choose a different starting price."
