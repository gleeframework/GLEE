"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is significantly higher than what I need to obtain. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000, a price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party, John, who's willing to purchase it for $800,000. Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
