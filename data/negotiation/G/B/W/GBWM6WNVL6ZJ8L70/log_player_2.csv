"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This gives me room to increase my offer gradually while staying well below my $80 maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob, but I'm still a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $90 is still above my budget. I'll counter with a price closer to my limit to signal that I'm serious but also price-sensitive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm getting closer to my maximum budget, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation in case Alice rejects this offer. I want to convey a sense of urgency to encourage her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to sell it to you for $85, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85, and that's above my maximum budget. I can get the product for a guaranteed $80 from John, so it makes more sense to take that deal now instead of risking further negotiation with Alice."
