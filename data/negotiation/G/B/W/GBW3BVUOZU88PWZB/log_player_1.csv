{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $95."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $87 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll see if I can get him up to $90 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there yet on the price.  I'm willing to come down to $89.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I am willing to consider $88 as the final price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer. While I would have loved to get $90, $88 is still a good price, especially given that I can always sell to John for $80 if this deal falls through. It's time to close this deal!"
