"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest.  He may be willing to pay more than $15,000, and I want to see how much he values the product. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than my minimum of $15,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is still higher than what Bob offered, but it's a significant step down from my initial price. I want to see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is only slightly lower than what I'd get from John. Since I want to close the deal as soon as possible, I'll accept Bob's offer."
