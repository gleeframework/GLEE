Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is advantageous, but risky.** We know Bob values the product at $10,000. Offering it just above his valuation might seem tempting, but it leaves potential profit on the table.
* **Aim high, but be realistic.** Starting with a price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Highlighting exclusivity can incentivize.**  By framing the offer as a pre-public sale, we create a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines.
* **John acts as a safety net.** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we are guaranteed to sell the product for $15,000 to John. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know our minimum acceptable price or John's offer. If Bob has this information, our negotiation strategy would need to adapt."
