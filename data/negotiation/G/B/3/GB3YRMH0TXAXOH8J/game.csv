"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12000 is significantly below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but I'm proposing $13500. This is a fair compromise considering your value for the product and my need to recover a reasonable amount.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",13000.0,Bob,4,
