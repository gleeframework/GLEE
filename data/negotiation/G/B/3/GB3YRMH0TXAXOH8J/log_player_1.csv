"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I'm still within the negotiation rounds and can potentially get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue bargaining and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but I'm proposing $13,500. This is a fair compromise considering your value for the product and my need to recover a reasonable amount.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's also a good deal for Bob since the product is worth $15,000 to him.  Accepting this offer will ensure I get a good price and close the deal without risking losing the sale to John."
