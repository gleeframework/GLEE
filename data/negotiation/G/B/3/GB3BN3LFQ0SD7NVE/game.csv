Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. What do you think?,1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900000. This is a fair price for a product I'm genuinely interested in, and it allows for some room for negotiation.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you're firm on the value of the product, but $1200000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1050000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1175000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm open to further negotiation, but I need to ensure I'm getting a reasonable return on my investment. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1150000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm confident that the product's value is worth more than this, but I'm willing to compromise to close the deal.
