"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $8,000, so I'm not setting an unrealistic price. This should give us a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I want to try to get closer to my ideal price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's perceived value. I hope this will encourage him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but selling to John is always an option if I can't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $8,200.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a bit more. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob and going another round to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $8,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept it. If he rejects, I'll sell to John for $8,000 to ensure I don't lose any more money."
