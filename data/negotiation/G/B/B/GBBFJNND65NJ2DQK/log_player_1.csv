Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the value in. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true value and potential for you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob.
* **Justification:**  By framing the price as reflective of the product's ""true value and potential,"" you aim to shift Bob's focus from a pure negotiation to the inherent worth of the product.
* **Potential for negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob pushes back, allowing you to potentially meet in the middle while still exceeding your minimum price.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's guaranteed offer. If Bob knew about John, your negotiating position weakens."
