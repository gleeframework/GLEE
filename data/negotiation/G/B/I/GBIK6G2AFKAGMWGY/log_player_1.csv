Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm suggesting a price of $925,000.  This is a unique chance to acquire something truly valuable."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth to encourage Bob to accept.

**Why not higher?**  While we know Bob values it at $1,000,000, a price too close to that might make him balk and assume there's no room for negotiation.

**Why not lower?** Going much lower significantly reduces potential profit. We have a strong fallback option with John."
