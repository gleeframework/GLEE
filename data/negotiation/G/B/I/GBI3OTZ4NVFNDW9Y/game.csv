"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to the product's worth to you.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This offer reflects the value this product brings while still acknowledging your interest.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price would be a good compromise.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,100.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",10100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,100 and my previous offer of $9,800. Would you consider $9,950? I think this is a fair compromise that would allow us to reach a deal.",9950.0,Bob,6,
