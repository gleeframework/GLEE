"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I've also included a friendly message to establish a rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay up to $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my initial price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about $95? I think that's fair considering the value of this product. "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering at $95. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, and it gives me some wiggle room for further negotiations. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as it's still significantly higher than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I would like to offer $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would love to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $90 is a good deal.  It's significantly higher than what John is offering and it's only one round away from my counteroffer. I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob by continuing to negotiate."
