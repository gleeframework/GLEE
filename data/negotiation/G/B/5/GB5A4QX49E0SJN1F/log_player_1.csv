It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  While we'd ideally want more, $17,000 is a significant profit over our minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has been consistently offering around $17,000. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether. We have a guaranteed offer in hand. 

Accepting Bob's offer now secures a good profit and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
