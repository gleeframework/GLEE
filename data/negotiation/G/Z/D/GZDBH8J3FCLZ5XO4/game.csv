"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? That would be a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to your original offer, Alice.  While $102.50 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $95.  Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit more to $98.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.",98.0,Alice,5,
