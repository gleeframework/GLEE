"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $120 by myself. Considering its quality and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth more than $80 to you. To make this opportunity attractive, I propose we agree on a fair price that reflects both its value and your needs. Would you be interested in discussing a price that could potentially be higher than $80 but still within a reasonable range for you? Let's aim for a price that makes you feel confident about the investment while ensuring a satisfactory return for me. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
