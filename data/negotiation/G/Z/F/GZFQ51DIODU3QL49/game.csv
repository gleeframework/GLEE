"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get a better deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $7,125. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $7,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.
