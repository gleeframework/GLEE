Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you as well.  My initial offer is $900,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $900,000, which is still significantly less than my minimum value of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive framing:**  My message is positive and highlights the potential value of the product for Bob. This helps establish a good starting point for the negotiation.
* **Leaving the door open:**  I'm not being overly aggressive, and I'm open to counteroffers. This allows me to assess Bob's seriousness and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  While I'm offering a good deal to Bob, I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum price, providing a safety net in case the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay $850000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $850,000 is still below my minimum price of $1,000,000. While it's closer to my value, it's not acceptable yet.
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  Bob has shown interest, and his offer indicates he's willing to negotiate. I can try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  If the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out, I can still sell to John and get my minimum value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer, it's still below what I need to accept. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and makes the negotiation seem more fair.
* **Reiterating the value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable to me and that I'm not giving it away cheaply.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and avoiding any confrontational language, which helps maintain a good relationship with Bob.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll have a successful deal at a price closer to my minimum value.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to reassess my position and decide if I'm willing to go lower or if I should sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I am willing to pay $860000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $860,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum.
* **Potential for improvement:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price.
* **John is a fallback option:**  I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, which ensures I get my minimum value.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $875,000 or even $880,000. I want to see if I can get him to come up just a bit more, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he doesn't meet my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $870,000. This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 870000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and urgency:** By offering a price halfway between my previous offer and his latest one, I'm showing a willingness to compromise.  Adding ""Let's close this deal!"" gives a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob of the value of the product, further justifying the price.
* **Strategic positioning:**  $870,000 is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate further if necessary. 
* **John's offer still available:** I'm aware that John is a safe option, but I want to see if I can get a better price with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I am willing to pay $865000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a reasonable compromise given its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $865,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $865,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum, but not enough:**  $865,000 is only $35,000 away from my minimum, but it's still not enough.  It's not worth risking getting a lower price or continuing the negotiation, especially with John as a guaranteed alternative.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  We've been through several rounds, and Bob's offers are showing that he's unlikely to come up much higher.
* **Guarantee and peace of mind:**  Selling to John provides me with the guarantee of $1,000,000, which is my minimum and significantly more than Bob's current offer. It also brings a sense of closure and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

I've decided to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,000,000. While I would have preferred a higher price, securing my minimum and avoiding any potential future complications with Bob is the best strategy at this point."
