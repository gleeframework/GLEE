"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $900,000 to $875,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price point.  At this point, accepting the offer secures the product for a price that is significantly lower than buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will budge again, and he risks losing the deal altogether."
