"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $200 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $200 might be a stretch, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $175, but I'm still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm happy to pay $150 for it, which I think is fair given our discussions.  Let's see if we can make this work.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $165. I think the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $162.50?",162.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $162.50 is still a bit high for me.  Let's aim for a price that feels good for both of us. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering the value we've discussed.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to go down to $155, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $140.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",140.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiations, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $150. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $145. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",145.0,Alice,9,
