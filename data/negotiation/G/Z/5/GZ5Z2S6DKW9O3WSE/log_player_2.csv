"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $110 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This will lead you to John's offer of $120, but you can try to negotiate with John for a lower price."
