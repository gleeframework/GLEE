"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate and still achieve a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to get a decent price."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant. It's getting late in the negotiation, but I'm confident I can get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm getting closer to Bob's price point but still leaving a little wiggle room.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this offer.  It's time to start getting serious about a deal."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and while I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting close to my minimum. I'm taking the deal to avoid potentially losing out to John."
