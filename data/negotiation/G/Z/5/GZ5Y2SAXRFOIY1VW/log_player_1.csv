Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to the product's value to you ($120) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** While Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives the offer as beneficial.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John.

By offering the product at $119, you're maximizing your potential profit while still leaving a small margin for Bob to feel like he's getting a slightly better deal than your fallback option."
