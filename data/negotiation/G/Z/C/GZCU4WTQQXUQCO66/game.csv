"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8,500. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
