I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a fair price that leaves room for negotiation but still allows me to earn a significant amount of money. 

I've chosen this price because it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and because it's above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. This means that Bob has an incentive to negotiate, but I still have a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair and reasonable counteroffer, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that reaching an agreement with Bob might be difficult and time-consuming.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I get the best possible outcome without further negotiation."
