{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's just below my minimum asking price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's below my minimum asking price, so I can potentially lower it if Bob counteroffers.
* **Is appealing to Bob:** It's lower than the value he places on the product, so he has an incentive to accept.
* **Keeps the door open:** If Bob rejects, I can always counteroffer or sell to John for my minimum asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is my final offer,  let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum asking price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,500, but I'm still a little below my target price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500 for the product.  This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
