This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I believe I can do better. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe this price is fair. It's significantly higher than what Bob offered and still allows for a good profit margin."
