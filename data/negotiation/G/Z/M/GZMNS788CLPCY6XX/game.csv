"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll agree.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",13500.0,Bob,4,
