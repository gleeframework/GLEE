"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase it immediately.",100.0,Bob,2,
