Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll try to negotiate a higher price."

$1,350,000 is a decent price, and it's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob. Accepting his offer is the best option right now."
