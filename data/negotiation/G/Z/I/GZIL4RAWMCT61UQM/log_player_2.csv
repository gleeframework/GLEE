Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.

Alice is getting closer to my price range, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,025,000. I'll try to negotiate a lower price. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $1,000,000."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $980,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,015,000, which is closer to your offer but still reflects the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still coming down, but she's not moving quickly enough. I'm getting concerned that we'll run out of rounds before I can get her lower. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, so I'll take the sure thing and buy from John."
