"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you getting closer to my price point, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to offer $980,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $980,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,015,000, which is closer to your offer but still reflects the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
