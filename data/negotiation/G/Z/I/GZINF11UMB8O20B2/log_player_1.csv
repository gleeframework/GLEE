Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value to see if there's room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still below my preferred price point. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. This shows I'm flexible but also serious about getting a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is now at a price point that is very close to my desired value and is a better deal than selling to John. It is worth it to accept the offer and end the negotiation."
