Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. $75 is below my minimum threshold, and I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I can't go as low as $75, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $82.50? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go as low as $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'll counter again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to further negotiation, but $78 is still below my minimum. How about we settle on $80?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 80}
