**Reasoning:** We're getting very close to the end of negotiations, and while Bob is inching closer to my price, I'm still willing to hold out for a slightly better deal. The risk of losing him as a buyer is now higher, but so is the potential reward of securing a higher price."

{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob seems stuck at $965,000.  He hasn't budged in two rounds, indicating he might not be willing to go any higher. With only a few rounds left and a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, it's too risky to continue with Bob. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed profit."
