"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my reach. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
