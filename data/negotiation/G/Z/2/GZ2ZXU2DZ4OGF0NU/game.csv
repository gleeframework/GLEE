"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  It's incredibly valuable, and I believe it would be worth $1,500,000 to you in the long run. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000.  What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I'm seeing in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,100,000 is a significant drop from my initial price. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of what's on the table.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,225,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,187,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,162,500, which is a compromise that I believe is fair. Let's finalize this deal.",1162500.0,Bob,6,
