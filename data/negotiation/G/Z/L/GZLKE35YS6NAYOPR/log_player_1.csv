"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```
At this point, Bob is offering the absolute minimum I'm willing to take.  There's no room for negotiation left, and it's not worth my time to continue haggling.  John provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price.
