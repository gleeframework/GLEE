{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price around $12,000 leaves a good margin for you while still being attractive to Bob. He saves $3,000 compared to his perceived value. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you have John as a backup, it's always better to secure the highest possible price first."
