"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $11,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $11,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $10,500? That seems like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a compromise, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10750.0,Alice,5,
