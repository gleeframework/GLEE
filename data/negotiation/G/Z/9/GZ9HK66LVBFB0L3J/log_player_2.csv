"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $10,000 to him, and Alice is offering it for $18,000, which is far above his budget.  He should try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford right now.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his target price, he can still do better. He should continue to negotiate a lower price, remembering that he has the option to buy from John for $10,000 if the negotiation fails."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and your concessions. Let's see if we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}

I've already made a significant concession, and I think this price is still a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $14,000, so I'll offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target price, he can still do better.  He's only got a few rounds left and should try to get closer to his $12,000 counteroffer.  Remember, he has the option to buy from John for $10,000 if the negotiation fails."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and your final offer.  However, I'm still hoping to close this deal at a lower price.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and my last offer, and I'll pay $13,250.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this sale."", ""product_price"": 13250}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. I've already made a significant concession, and I think this price is still a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,250 and $13,500, so I'll offer it to you for $13,375.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  He has only one round left to negotiate with Alice, and she is unlikely to budge further.  Since John is selling the product for $10,000, it's a better deal for Bob than accepting Alice's offer of $13,375."
