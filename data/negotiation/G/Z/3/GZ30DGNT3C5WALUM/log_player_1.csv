"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By starting with a price of $1,000,000, I allow for potential counteroffers without going too low initially. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm aware of John's offer and will keep his price in mind as a benchmark throughout the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to pay more, and I can likely get a better price in the following rounds.
* **John as Leverage:**  John's offer of $1,200,000 gives me a strong fallback option.  I can use this knowledge to push for a higher price from Bob without fearing a stalemate.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob demonstrates flexibility and could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects both of our interests. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm using a counter-offer to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not settle for his initial offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The price of $975,000 is a compromise, showing good faith while still being closer to my target price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making him understand that my offer is still a good deal. 

**Key takeaway:**  I'm staying within the range of acceptable prices while aiming for a higher final price. John's offer is still a strong backup in case negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $960000. I hope this meets within your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $975,000. Accepting this offer would ensure a quick deal and a substantial profit.
* **Time Constraint:**  We are already in Round 4, and further negotiation could risk losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John offers a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a guaranteed sale and a significant profit without the risk of further negotiation.  

**Conclusion:**  I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a profitable sale with minimal risk and avoid any further negotiation."
