"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $875,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above what he'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $850000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's budget:** At $850,000, the offer is only $50,000 above what Bob is willing to pay from John. 
* **Limited time:** This is Round 5, meaning only 5 rounds remain.  It's likely Alice won't budge much further.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer and the price could go up again.

**Overall:**  It's a calculated risk, but accepting the offer is the most likely way to secure the product without exceeding Bob's budget significantly."
