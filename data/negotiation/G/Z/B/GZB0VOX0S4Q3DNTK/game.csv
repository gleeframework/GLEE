"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000. Would you be open to considering that?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $875000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $825000.  What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $850000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
