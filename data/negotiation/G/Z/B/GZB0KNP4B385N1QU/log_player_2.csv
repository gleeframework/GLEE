"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $13,000. I believe this price reflects its true value and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite high. There's a lot of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to establish a starting point significantly lower than Alice's initial offer while still leaving room for negotiation. The tone is polite and expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, the product's value is considerably higher. Could you meet me halfway at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $11,000 is still significantly higher than both your ideal price and John's offer. It's worth countering again to see if you can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

This counter-offer makes a smaller jump down in price, showing Alice that we're getting closer to a price we're willing to pay. It also emphasizes fairness and positions $10,000 as a compromise."
