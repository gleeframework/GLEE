"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  We're aiming to save as much money as possible, so it's worth exploring counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This would give you a good profit and secure a sale for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product offers you even more value than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise and fits within Bob's budget.  While Bob could potentially continue to negotiate, it's risky. If Alice rejects the counteroffer, she may offer a higher price or even walk away from the deal. Accepting the offer secures the product at a decent price, and it's still better than buying from John at $1,200,000."
