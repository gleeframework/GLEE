"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your operations.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value to create a sense that he's getting a good deal while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the product's benefits and my belief in its value to Bob. This helps build rapport and emphasizes the potential gain.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm using phrases like ""starting price"" and ""proposing"" to signal flexibility and openness to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could accept and end the negotiation now, there's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. I'm willing to counter-offer in the hopes of meeting somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, my original offer reflects the true worth and potential this product offers.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,325,000.  This offer represents a significant investment from my end while still acknowledging the value it brings to your table."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer but reiterating the product's value to justify a higher price.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession by dropping $75,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm framing the new price as a compromise that benefits both parties, emphasizing fairness.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm avoiding a rapid race to the bottom and holding firm to a price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,200,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the value the product will bring to my operations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $1,200,000. While I could push for more, his willingness to move to $1,300,000 is a positive sign. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $100,000 above my minimum and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or him walking away.  It's a solid deal at this point."
