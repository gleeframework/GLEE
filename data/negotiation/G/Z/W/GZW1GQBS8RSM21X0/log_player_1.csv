"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for a product worth $120 to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:**  You're earning more than your minimum $80.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  $100 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's less than the product's value to him. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You can still increase the price if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $90?  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still above your minimum of $80 and it's a good deal for both parties.  It's worth accepting to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or even selling to John for $80."
