"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $14,000. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $10,000 to Bob.  Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is too high.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should buy the product from John for $10,000, as this is the best deal for him."
