"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 to see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the value it will bring you while still being a fair deal for me.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I must adhere to my budgetary constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This price point allows me to maximize the value I receive from the product while staying within my financial limits.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but the value of this product is undeniable. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,500,000.  This is my absolute lowest price, as I already have another buyer lined up at this amount.  It's a decision between a great deal now or potentially losing out.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
