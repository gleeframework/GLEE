Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer aims to maximize my profit while still leaving Bob with a significant gain. Here's why:

* **It's a good deal for Bob:** He values the product at $1,500,000 and can buy it for $1,400,000, saving him $100,000.
* **It's a good deal for me:** I can make $400,000 more than selling to John, which is my guaranteed minimum. 

There's a good chance Bob will accept, as he gets a great price and a valuable product.  If he rejects, I can still sell to John and secure my minimum profit."
