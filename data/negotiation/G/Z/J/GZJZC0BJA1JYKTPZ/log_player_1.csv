"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 130} 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob. This is a starting point for negotiation, and I hope to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a compromise between my ideal price and Bob's offer. I believe there's still some room for negotiation, but I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $118 is very close to my minimum acceptable value. I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too greedy, and John's offer is only $2 more. It's time to close the deal."
