{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone by highlighting the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. Would you consider accepting $85 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is close to your minimum, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain leverage and signal that you are willing to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  How about $88?  It's a fair price that acknowledges your interest and still allows me to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $86 for the product. This price respects the value you place on it while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer from Bob is a good compromise, and it's only $2 less than your original asking price.  While you could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk is that Bob might walk away, and you'll end up selling to John for less."
