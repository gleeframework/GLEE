"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice's offer of $120 is better than John's offer of $150, but you can do better.  Since you have another option (John), you can try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."
