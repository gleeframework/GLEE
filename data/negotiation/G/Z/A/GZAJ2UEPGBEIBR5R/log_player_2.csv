"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong starting point:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. It establishes a position from which we can work upwards.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will gauge Alice's flexibility. Her response will tell us a lot about her willingness to move on price and how aggressively we need to negotiate. 
* **Backup plan:** We always have the option to go with John for $800,000. This counteroffer is well below that, maximizing potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has come down, $850,000 is still above our maximum budget and our fallback option with John.
* **Room for negotiation:** There are seven rounds left, and Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests we can likely get the price lower. 
* **Strategic positioning:** By continuing to counter, we maintain pressure on Alice and signal our seriousness about getting a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm definitely interested in finding a way to make this work. How about we meet in the middle of our last two offers at $750,000? I think that's a fair deal that reflects the product's value."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer proposes a compromise by splitting the difference between our previous offer ($650,000) and Alice's latest counteroffer ($850,000). 
* **Showing flexibility:** By moving closer to Alice's price, we demonstrate our willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Staying strategic:** We're still well below our $800,000 fallback with John, giving us room to maneuver if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $750000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $820000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached our limit:** Alice is clearly hesitant to go below $800,000. Her offer of $820,000 is only a small concession from her previous offer. 
* **John is the safer option:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her not coming down enough. We have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000, which is within our budget. 
* **Time is a factor:**  We have fewer rounds left, and it's better to secure the product now at a reasonable price rather than risk the negotiation failing and having to settle for a less favorable deal later."
