"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's room for both parties to benefit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise, closer to Bob's desired price of $10,000. This is a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 price.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice could walk away or make a counteroffer closer to her original price. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets a good deal and avoids further risk."
