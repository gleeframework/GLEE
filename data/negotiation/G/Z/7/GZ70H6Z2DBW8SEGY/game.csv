"While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this product is worth more, but I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,5,
