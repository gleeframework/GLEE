"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price, aiming for something closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting at $60 is a strong counter-offer. It's significantly lower than Alice's starting price but still leaves room for negotiation to reach a price that works for both of us.
* **Gauging Flexibility:** This offer will help us understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate. If she's open to a deal, she'll likely counter with a lower price. If she's firm on a price close to $100, we can adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down $10, which is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. However, $90 is still too high. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By suggesting $75, we're meeting Alice halfway between her offer of $90 and our previous offer of $60. This signals a willingness to compromise.
* **Stronger Position:** We're still closer to our ideal price of $80 (John's offer) than Alice is to her desired $120. This puts us in a good negotiating position. 
* **Time Consideration:** We're over halfway through the rounds. Offering a price closer to what we're willing to pay increases the chances of closing the deal with Alice, avoiding the need to go with John's backup offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we try $85? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $85 is only $5 more than our ideal price from John. It's unlikely that Alice will come down much further. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We have five rounds left, but there's no guarantee we'll get a better offer from Alice. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate increases the chance of the deal falling through, forcing us to go with John's offer anyway."
