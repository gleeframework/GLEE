"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $11,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price of $10,000. There are still 9 rounds left, so Bob should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm hoping to get a better price.  Considering the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you the product for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,250 is closer to his target, it's still not ideal. There are still 7 rounds left, and Bob should continue trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,250 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, which is a good price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about we try $11,200? I think we can both be happy with that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your persistence, $11,200 is still a little too high for me. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $11,000.  I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're so close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,000. However, I still need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about we try $11,100? It's a small increase, but it's still a great deal for you, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  There are only 3 rounds remaining. 
* **Alice is close:** Alice's offer of $11,100 is only $100 above Bob's ideal price of $11,000.
* **The risk of John:**  If Bob rejects Alice's offer, he risks having to buy from John at $12,000.

While Bob would prefer to get the product for $11,000, accepting Alice's offer is the most practical choice given the limited time and the risk of a higher price from John."
