{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's less than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to you. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **The goal is to save as much money as possible.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** My counteroffer is based on the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). I'm adding a reasonable margin of $500 to account for potential negotiation. 
* **Strategic approach:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I save a significant amount compared to both Alice's offer and John's price. 
* **Flexibility:** If Alice rejects this counteroffer, I'll have room to adjust my offer based on her response."

* **Minimizing cost is crucial.** While Alice's offer is better than John's, I can likely secure a lower price by continuing to negotiate."

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's last offer while still being within my acceptable price range.
* **Testing the waters:** By offering a slightly higher price than my previous counteroffer, I gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to compromise further.
* **Maximizing savings:** This offer allows me to save a substantial amount compared to Alice's last offer and John's price, while still leaving room for negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Savings:** Alice's offer is now only $900 above the product's worth to her, a significant reduction from her initial price. This is a substantial saving for me compared to John's price. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away and me being forced to buy from John at a much higher price. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:** Accepting this offer represents a reasonable compromise that allows me to get the product at a good price while minimizing risk."
