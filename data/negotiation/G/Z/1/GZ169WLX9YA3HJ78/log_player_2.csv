You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $77. I can do $82, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $82 secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through entirely."
