Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always a good strategy to start with an offer higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Anchoring:**  By setting a high initial price, I'm ""anchoring"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he doesn't accept the $120, he might be more amenable to a slightly lower price (still above $80) than if I started low.
* **Backup Plan:** I know John will buy the product for $80, so I'm not desperate. This allows me to be more assertive in my pricing with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects it."
