{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your commitment to the purchase. However,  $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try $975,000. This is a final compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair price that balances both our needs.  I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial in the long run.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I value your commitment to this deal.  However,  $925,000  just doesn't cover the significant value of this product.
