Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it would be a valuable asset to you, and this is a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but you also want to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation but ensures you're well above Bob's perceived value.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, guaranteeing you at least $15,000. This gives you leverage to aim slightly higher with Bob.

By starting at $14,000, you might:

* **Secure a Deal:** Bob might accept immediately, netting you a higher profit than selling to John.
* **Open Negotiations:**  Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially negotiate a price closer to your desired range.
