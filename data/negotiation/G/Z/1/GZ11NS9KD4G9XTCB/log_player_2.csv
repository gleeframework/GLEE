"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make a deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are willing to pay up to $8,000. Alice's offer is $2,000 higher. It makes sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the concession, $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still significantly above what I could get it for elsewhere. Let me know if you're willing to consider this."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I've put into preparing the product for sale. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still $1,500 more than you are willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a price closer to your target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to give up on the extra $500 just yet. I'll offer you a revised price of $9,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $9,250 is still $1,250 above your maximum budget. While you could continue to negotiate, the risk of a prolonged negotiation leading to a breakdown is high. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $8,000, securing the product at a price you're comfortable with."
