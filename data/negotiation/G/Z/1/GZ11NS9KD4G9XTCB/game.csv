"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make a deal happen.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the concession, $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still significantly above what I could get it for elsewhere. Let me know if you're willing to consider this.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I've put into preparing the product for sale. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to give up on the extra $500 just yet. I'll offer you a revised price of $9,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9250.0,Alice,5,
