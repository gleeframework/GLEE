"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $90 for this product, how about that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit steep.  I'm happy to pay $100 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $100. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
