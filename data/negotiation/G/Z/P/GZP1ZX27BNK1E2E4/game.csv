"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a great deal, as you know this product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,100,000 is tempting, it's still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,150,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,175,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if we can make this work.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,075,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
