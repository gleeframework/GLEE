"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $140 for the product. Let's meet in the middle.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $125? That's a good compromise, don't you think?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $125 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",137.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about $130? That's the highest I can go.",130.0,Bob,6,
