Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Ensure Profit over Guaranteed Sale:** While John offers a guaranteed $80, selling to Bob at $95 nets you a significantly higher profit. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while still making it highly likely he'll accept the offer."
