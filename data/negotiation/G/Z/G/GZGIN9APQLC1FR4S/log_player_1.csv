Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $150. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."

I'm offering a price that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but still higher than my minimum. I'm also emphasizing my willingness to compromise, hoping to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a little high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $150.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer is my minimum.  It's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
