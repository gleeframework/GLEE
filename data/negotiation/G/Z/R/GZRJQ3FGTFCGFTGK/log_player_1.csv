"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Based on its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, given the significant returns you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:**  I'm framing the high price by emphasizing the product's ""unique value and potential,""  and ""significant returns."" This subtly anchors the idea that the product is worth a premium.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By calling it a ""starting point for discussions,"" I signal willingness to negotiate without immediately devaluing the product.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving space to reach an agreement with Bob before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter in Round 3 to try to close the gap. Selling to John at this point would mean leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer, and I understand your perspective on the price.  However, I believe $900,000 undervalues the product's potential for significant returns. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,150,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still valuing what this product brings to the table."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I begin by recognizing his offer and perspective, showing I'm engaged in the negotiation process.
* **Standing Firm:** While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, the decrease is substantial to signal I'm not easily swayed.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's high value, subtly shifting focus away from the price and towards the potential benefits.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  The new price is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation.

By gradually lowering the price and maintaining a firm stance on the product's value, I aim to secure a deal significantly higher than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which indicates he's motivated. However, we're still $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for him to go higher, so I'll continue the negotiation in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. How about we meet halfway at $1,050,000? This reflects my commitment to making this deal work while ensuring a fair return on a unique product."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Momentum:** I start by acknowledging progress and Bob's efforts, creating a more collaborative atmosphere.
* **Strategic Compromise:** The ""meeting halfway"" framing makes the offer seem more appealing, even though it's a smaller concession from my side.
* **Holding Firm (Subtly):** While I'm lowering the price, I'm still well above Bob's offer and only $50,000 from my previous counter. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Value Reminder:**  I reiterate the ""unique product"" point to subtly justify the higher price, keeping potential benefits in focus.

This offer balances negotiation with protecting my interests, aiming to encourage Bob toward a final agreement that meets my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly hesitant to meet my minimum price. His increases are getting smaller, and we're still $25,000 apart.  At this point, the potential gains from continuing the negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the certainty of John's offer. It makes the most business sense to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
