"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's far above your maximum budget and even higher than her own valuation. You should definitely counteroffer and see if you can negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $2,000,000 is way more than I'm willing to pay for this product.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000.  What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($1,000,000) gives you room to negotiate while signaling that Alice's initial price was unrealistic. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message remains courteous and suggests finding a mutually beneficial agreement, encouraging further negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer is closer to your true value but still leaves space to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,750,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice came down significantly, $1,750,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Her willingness to move from her initial offer indicates there's room for further negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** You always have the option to go with John's offer of $1,200,000, giving you leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you consider something closer to $1,150,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer moves closer to the middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's current one.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  It keeps you below your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** It leaves some room for Alice to potentially counter-offer if she's really motivated to sell to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. $1,150,000 is still quite a way off.  Perhaps we could settle at $1,550,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is still significantly above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Slow Progress:** While she has come down in price, the negotiations are progressing too slowly. It's unlikely she'll meet your budget within a reasonable timeframe. 
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,200,000. It makes more financial sense to take the sure deal than continue negotiating for a potentially uncertain outcome."
