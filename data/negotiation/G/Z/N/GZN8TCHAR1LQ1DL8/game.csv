"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $2,000,000 is way more than I'm willing to pay for this product.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you consider something closer to $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. $1,150,000 is still quite a way off.  Perhaps we could settle at $1,550,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
