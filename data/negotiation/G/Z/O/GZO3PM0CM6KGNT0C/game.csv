"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,000,000. Would that be feasible?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
