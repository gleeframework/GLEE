"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, creating a dialogue.

**Strategy:** 

I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he's not, I'll adjust my offer in subsequent rounds. However, I'm keeping my minimum in mind and the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  Bob's offer is above my minimum of $8,000, but it's still significantly lower than my ideal price.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I want to see if I can push for a higher price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe there's room for negotiation.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John for $8,000 is tempting, I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to close the gap between our prices. I'll try to find a price that's both acceptable to me and enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That gives you a significant savings and me a fair price.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Benefits:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob by emphasizing the ""significant savings"" he'd get.
* **Call to Action:** I'm urging Bob to make a decision, creating a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a price point that's attractive to both of us.  By offering a compromise, I'm signaling that I'm serious about closing the deal.  I'm also keeping in mind that I still have a backup option with John, so I'm not desperate to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not yet willing to accept it.  The product is worth significantly more to Bob, and I believe I can still get a better price.
* **Negotiation Momentum:**  We've made good progress in the negotiations.  By rejecting his offer, I'm showing that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Time Remaining:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have ample time to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable agreement.

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  I'll emphasize the value of the product to Bob and reiterate my willingness to find a solution that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,000. This is a fair price, and it ensures we both get a great deal.  Let's close this deal and move forward!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Finality:** I'm offering a slightly lower price, demonstrating a willingness to compromise and showing Bob that this is my final offer.
* **Focus on Win-Win:** I'm emphasizing that this price creates a win-win situation for both of us, emphasizing the ""great deal"" for him. 
* **Urgency and Closure:** I'm using phrases like ""close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

By making a slightly lower offer and emphasizing the benefits for both of us, I hope to convince Bob to accept. I'm nearing my minimum, but I believe this offer is fair and still leaves a decent profit margin. If Bob rejects this, I'll strongly consider selling to John, as time is running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm pleased to see we're getting closer.  While $10,000 is an improvement, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,500.  How about we settle on $9,750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finally close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer is only $250 away from my minimum acceptable price. This is a small difference, and it would be a decent profit.
* **Time Factor:** We're approaching the middle of the negotiations, and with only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob increases.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, the potential gains might not outweigh the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John at a lower price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer because it's a good compromise, and I want to secure a sale. This gives me a fair price and ensures that I don't lose out completely on the potential profit. The next few rounds would likely involve smaller adjustments, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
