"I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see you're interested in the product, but $900000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still very interested in the product, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really serious about buying the product, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1025000?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, Alice, but $1025000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it at this price. I'm getting a bit concerned that if we don't meet in the middle soon, I might have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're getting a bit anxious, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm not willing to go much lower than $1025000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $990000 and $1025000. How about $1007500?",1007500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $995000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm seriously considering buying from John for $1000000 if we can't come to an agreement.",995000.0,Bob,10,
