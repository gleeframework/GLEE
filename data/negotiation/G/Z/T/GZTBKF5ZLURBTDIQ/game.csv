"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12000 is still a little low for me. How about $13500? I think that's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, as that's the absolute maximum I can afford. If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with John's offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,
