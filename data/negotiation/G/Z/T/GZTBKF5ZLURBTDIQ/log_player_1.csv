{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum value, but not so high that it immediately scares Bob away. It also leaves room for potential negotiation and counteroffers.  By including a message, you are building a friendly rapport which can be helpful in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below your minimum value. You can likely get closer to your desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is still a little low for me. How about $13,500? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, as that's the absolute maximum I can afford. If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is still below your ideal price, it's closer to your minimum value of $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether, leaving you with only the $10,000 offer from John. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale above your minimum, and avoids the risk of losing out entirely."
