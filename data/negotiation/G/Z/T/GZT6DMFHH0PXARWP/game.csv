"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I know that similar products are selling for upwards of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500. I think this is a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your research, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $10500. I'm willing to pay $9500, which is a fair price considering the market value you mentioned. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10000, but that's as low as I can go. This product is worth a lot to me, and I'm not willing to sell it for less than that.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $10000. I'm willing to pay $9000, and that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,6,
