"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $900,000? It's still a good price for you, and a significant saving for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still leaves a significant profit margin for me, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
