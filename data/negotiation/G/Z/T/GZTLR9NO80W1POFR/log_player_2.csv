Alice's offer is too high, so it makes sense to reject it and see if we can negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $200 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $120. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's better to continue negotiating to see if we can get a better price.  John is always an option, but we might be able to get a better deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference - how about $140?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 140}
