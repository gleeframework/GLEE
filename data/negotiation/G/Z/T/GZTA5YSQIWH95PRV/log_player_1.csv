""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budgetary considerations, however, $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I could consider coming down to $875,000. This offer represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. What do you say?"",

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering my financial situation, I am only able to offer $800,000 for the product. I hope this aligns closer to your valuation.

Explanation: At this point, Bob is offering the same amount as your backup offer from John.  There's no guarantee Bob will go any higher, and further negotiation risks losing both offers. It's best to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
