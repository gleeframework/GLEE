"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there at $160. How about $140? It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not quite willing to go that low, Bob. I can do $155, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product and I think it's worth more than that.",155.0,Alice,5,
