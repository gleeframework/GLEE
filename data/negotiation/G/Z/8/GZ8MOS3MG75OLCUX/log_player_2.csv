You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John. While Alice uses marketing language to inflate the product's perceived value, the actual price is a good deal for you."
