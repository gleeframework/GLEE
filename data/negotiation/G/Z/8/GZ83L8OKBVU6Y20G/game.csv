"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $950,000? This allows you a great deal while also allowing me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate the negotiation.  However,  $920,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $935,000?
