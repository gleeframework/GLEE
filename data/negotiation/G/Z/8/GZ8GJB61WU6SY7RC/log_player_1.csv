"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. My asking price is $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer starts high, but it's still below Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate. It also leaves room for you to potentially go lower if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am interested, but I can only pay up to $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. It's worth seeing if I can get closer to my desired price range through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to stay closer to $90 to make this work.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but that's my bottom line.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price. I'm willing to push for a bit more to see if Bob will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $87 just doesn't work for me.  I'm firm on $89.  If you're serious about getting this product, this is our final offer."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your position, but I can't go beyond $88 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $88 is still a bit lower than I initially hoped for, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and a good compromise. Given the limited rounds and the risk of losing the sale entirely, it's a reasonable deal."
