"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $16,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000, so I'm offering $14,000 for the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $14,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $17,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and the negotiations so far.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $17,000. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations so far.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $13,500, but I'm still not convinced that's a good deal for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $18,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and the negotiations so far. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not reach an agreement, so I'm willing to make a slightly more aggressive offer this time.",18500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not on the same page here. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. My final offer is $13,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to find common ground. However, I'm not willing to compromise further. I'm thinking of $18,250 for the product. This is my final offer, and I expect you to accept it if you're interested in the product.",18250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made my decision, and I'm going to have to pass on your offer. I appreciate your time and effort, but I've decided to buy the product from someone else. I'm willing to make one final offer to you, just for the sake of closure. I'll pay $12,000 for the product, but that's it. If you're not willing to accept this, I'm walking away.",12000.0,Bob,10,
