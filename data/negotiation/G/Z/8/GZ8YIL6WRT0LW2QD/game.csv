"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $15000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement closer to this amount?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $17500. This is still a great price, and I believe it reflects the value you'll get out of this product. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,
