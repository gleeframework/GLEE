Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $10,000, which gives you a baseline.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $19,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit beyond your minimum. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value to justify the high initial price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You get a fantastic deal at $19,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price and still make a good profit, knowing your minimum is covered by John's offer. 
* **Bob Rejects:** You move on to John and secure your $15,000."
