```"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm sorry, but I've already gone as low as I can. I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,750. I think we're getting close, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  He's only got one round left, and Alice is firm on her price. While he could try to counteroffer one more time, it's unlikely Alice will budge.  Buying from John is the best option to ensure he gets the product at a price within his budget."
