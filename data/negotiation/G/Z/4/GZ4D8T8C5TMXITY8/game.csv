"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 was a bit steep, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me some of the way.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit higher than $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $17,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this amazing product.",17000.0,Alice,5,
