"Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95. If we can meet in the middle there, I'd be happy to purchase the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $97.50, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise for both of us.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $97.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is closer to my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement there.",90.0,Bob,6,
