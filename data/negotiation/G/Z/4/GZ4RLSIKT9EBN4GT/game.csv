"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $140. I can do $130, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $140, so I'll offer it to you for $135. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit short of $135. I can do $132, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",132.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $132. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'll sell the product to you for $134. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",134.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on your final offer. I was hoping we could meet at $132, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm going to go look elsewhere.",132.0,Bob,8,
