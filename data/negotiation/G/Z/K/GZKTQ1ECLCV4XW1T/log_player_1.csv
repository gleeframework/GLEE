Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  Let me know if this interests you, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.  This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value and the benefit of a ""pre-listing"" offer to justify the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is $19,000, the wording suggests a willingness to discuss, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price above your minimum."
