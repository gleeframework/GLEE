Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its unique nature and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing this further if needed."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value, making the higher price seem more palatable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing this further"" suggests there's flexibility in the price, which might encourage Bob to counter-offer rather than reject outright.

**Goal:** The aim is to maximize profit. While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, the potential gain from a higher selling price outweighs settling for the guaranteed $1,200,000 immediately."
