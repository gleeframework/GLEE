"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows us to both get a fair price. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $108? I think that's a fair compromise.,108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, how about $110? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to meet you at $109, but that's as low as I can go. Can you really not do any better than that?",109.0,Bob,6,
