"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and optimistic message encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $115 is still a good profit for me, and it leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer if he's not happy with the price. 

I'm hoping that Bob will accept the offer, but if he rejects it, I'm prepared to negotiate further and potentially even sell to John for $120 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Profit:** While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation Power:** I have the advantage in this situation. Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, and I have a backup buyer in John.  
* **Seeking Higher Price:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $120 before considering selling to John. 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows us to both get a fair price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but I'm still aiming for a price that meets my minimum acceptable threshold.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the deal's value for Bob by emphasizing a fair price for both of us.
* **Persistence:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm not afraid to negotiate and that I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 

I'm confident that $110 is a fair price that Bob might be willing to accept. If he still refuses, I'll need to re-evaluate whether to continue negotiating with him or sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $108? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** While $108 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at a better price, giving me leverage in this negotiation.
* **Seeking Higher Price:** I'm willing to continue negotiating for a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target price.

I'm going to counter Bob's offer again, hoping to nudge the price higher. If he rejects my next offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, how about $110? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking Point:**  I'm staying firm on $110, which is the last compromise I'm willing to make before considering selling to John.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price to Bob, reminding him that $110 is a good deal for both of us.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm indicating a desire to reach an agreement, hoping to persuade Bob to accept my offer.

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will likely sell to John in the next round. I'm running out of time and patience, and $110 is the best I can do while still making a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to meet you at $109, but that's as low as I can go. Can you really not do any better than that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. 
* **Profit Threshold:**  $109 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John is guaranteed to buy the product for $120, giving me a better profit than selling to Bob at $109.

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, I'm concerned about running out of time. John offers a secure and higher-profit sale, which is the best option at this point."
