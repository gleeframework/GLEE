"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. You know the product is worth $8,000 to you, and Alice wants at least $12,000.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $7,500. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above my maximum price. I'm hoping to push Alice to compromise, especially as she's likely to be motivated to sell the product since she values it at $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to accept $8,500. I'm close to my maximum price point, but there's still room to negotiate with Alice, especially with only 7 rounds remaining.  I'll try to get closer to $8,000 with my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $8,000.  I'm confident that she'll accept, as it's a significant improvement over my previous counteroffer and still above my maximum price.  If she rejects, I can always purchase the product from John for $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,200, which is only $200 more than my maximum price.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a better deal. It's a good compromise, allowing me to save some money compared to buying from John."
