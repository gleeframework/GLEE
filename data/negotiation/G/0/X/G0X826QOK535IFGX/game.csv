"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can't afford $1100000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, I'm not quite ready to drop the price that low. How about we meet in the middle at $1025000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, could we negotiate the price down to $1000000? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
