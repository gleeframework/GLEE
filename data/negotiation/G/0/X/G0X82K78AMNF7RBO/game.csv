"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as high as I can go.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $7,500 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $7,750. I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
