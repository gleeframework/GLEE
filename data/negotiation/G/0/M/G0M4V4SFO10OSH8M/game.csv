"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we try $108? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",108.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. How about we try $106? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",106.0,Alice,5,
