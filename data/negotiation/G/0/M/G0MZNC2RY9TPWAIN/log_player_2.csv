Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to bring the price down, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to ensure I'm not losing money on this deal. My next counteroffer is $1,050,000. I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly reducing her price.  At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly lower than John's offer of $1,000,000. It's better to cut our losses and secure the product from John at a reasonable price."
