"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to bring the price down a bit. Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking to bring the price down, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to ensure I'm not losing money on this deal. My next counteroffer is $1,050,000. I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
