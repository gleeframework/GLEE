Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth $15,000 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Target:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Flexibility:** By starting at $12,000, I leave myself room to make concessions during counter-offers, if needed. 
* **Plan B:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $8,000 gives me confidence to be firm during the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum value ($8,000) than my initial offer ($12,000), but I'm not satisfied with it yet. 
* **Potential for More:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. 
* **Plan B:**  While $8,000 from John is a guaranteed sale, I'm aiming for a better outcome with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price that's a bit lower than my initial offer but still higher than his.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains my value proposition."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $9,000 is a bit lower than what I had in mind, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a fair outcome.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counter-offer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate while also demonstrating that I still value the product.
* **Attractive Price:**  $10,500 is still a significant discount from Bob's perceived value ($15,000), making it an attractive proposition for him.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message emphasizes the ""great deal"" and ""fair outcome"" for both of us, hoping to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Next Steps:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to carefully consider whether to accept his next counter-offer or fall back to John's offer of $8,000."
