"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you consider my offer?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price. Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,200? That's the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate that. How about $8,300?  It's a small step closer to your offer, and a good compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal.",8300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,300 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,100, and that's as low as I can go. Please let me know if that works for you.",8100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting very close. How about we split the difference and go with $8,200?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!",8200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,150, and that's as low as I can go. Please let me know if that works for you.",8150.0,Bob,8,
