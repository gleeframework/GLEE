"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,000 is too far below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,200? That's the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,200 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my ideal price. I'm confident that with a few more rounds, we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate that. How about $8,300?  It's a small step closer to your offer, and a good compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8300}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,300 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,100, and that's as low as I can go. Please let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $8,100 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm confident that I can get a slightly better price with a few more rounds of negotiation.  I'll keep pushing for a price closer to $8,300."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close. How about we split the difference and go with $8,200?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,150, and that's as low as I can go. Please let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still less than I hoped for, I've only got two rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $8,150 is a decent price, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000."
