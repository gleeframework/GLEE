"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure the price is right.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your value for the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer of $1,250,000, I'm still hoping we can find a price that's more advantageous for both of us. How about we meet at $1,275,000? This price acknowledges your needs while allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let's finalize this deal and move forward!",1275000.0,Alice,5,
