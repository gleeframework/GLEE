Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering it at Bob's perceived value ($800,000) is unlikely to be accepted.  We need a price that's enticing to Bob but also significantly profitable for us.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without explicitly revealing our bottom line.

This approach aims to find a sweet spot where Bob might accept, securing a higher profit than our guaranteed sale to John."
