It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you're looking to save money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A $2,000 discount is a substantial starting point, and hopefully, Alice will see the value in working with me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still hoping to save more.  I'll counter again to try and reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a better price than her last offer.  Hopefully, this will convince her to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my target price.  While I could keep trying to negotiate, I'm at risk of running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a good price and still have room to maneuver if I need to negotiate with other sellers in the future."
