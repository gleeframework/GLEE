"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in its value at my initial asking price, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,100,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my end while still recognizing the true worth of this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value and our previous discussions.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  My final offer is $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
