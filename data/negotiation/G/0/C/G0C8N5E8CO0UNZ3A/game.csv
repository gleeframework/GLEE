"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking closer to $9,000. While I can't quite meet that, I could go up to $7,000. That's a significant increase from my previous offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $7,000, but it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering your budget and my minimum.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",8500.0,Alice,5,
