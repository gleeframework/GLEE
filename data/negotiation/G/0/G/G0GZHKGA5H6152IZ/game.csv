,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price given the market value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,150,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product's value and potential.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move towards a compromise.  However,  $1,150,000 still falls quite short of reflecting the true value of this product. Let's settle this right now:  I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's potential. ",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $1,200,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
