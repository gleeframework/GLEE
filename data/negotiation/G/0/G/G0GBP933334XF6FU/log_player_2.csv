You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to you.  Alice's offer is too high.  It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice, as you might be able to get the price down."

I'm offering Alice $8,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from her initial price, but still within my budget. It's a fair starting point for negotiation, and I'm hoping she'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my $10,000 limit. I'll try to negotiate with her again, but I'm also getting closer to just buying from John."

I'm offering Alice $9,500, which is a bit higher than my last offer but still below her asking price.  It's a compromise, and hopefully, she sees that we're getting closer to a deal. If she rejects again, I'm seriously considering buying from John."
