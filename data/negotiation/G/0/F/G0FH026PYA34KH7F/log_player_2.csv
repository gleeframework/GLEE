"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that. It's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is better for Bob than buying from John.  Here's why:

* **Alice's Price:** $1,100,000
* **John's Price:** $1,200,000

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $100,000 compared to buying from John.  Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, Bob still gets a good deal and saves money."
