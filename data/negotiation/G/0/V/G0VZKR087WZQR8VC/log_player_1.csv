Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into his level of interest and flexibility.  If he rejects it outright, you can always lower the price.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob."
