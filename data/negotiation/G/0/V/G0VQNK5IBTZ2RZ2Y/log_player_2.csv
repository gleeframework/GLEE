Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value you place on the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees the best price for you."
