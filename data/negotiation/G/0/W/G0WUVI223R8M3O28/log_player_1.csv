Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
This offer is:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:** $130 is higher than $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Below my minimum:**  $130 is still higher than my minimum of $150, ensuring I make a profit.

This strategy allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly to see if he's willing to negotiate.
* **Keep the option open for John:** If Bob rejects, I can quickly move on to John for the guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price. I can still sell to John for a higher price if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $110. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
 
**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  $110 is a significant concession, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** $110 is still higher than my minimum of $150, ensuring I don't lose money. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly, suggesting a desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 

This approach gives Bob a chance to counter again, but hopefully, it pushes the price closer to what I want, while still allowing me to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I've already made concessions, and Bob seems unwilling to budge further.  My goal is to maximize profit, and selling to John for $150 guarantees that. I'm willing to walk away from this negotiation and secure a better deal with John."
