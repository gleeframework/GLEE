,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product offers, and I'm willing to meet in the middle.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $7,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $9,000. My counteroffer is $8,250. I hope we can come to an agreement.",8250.0,Bob,4,
