Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a positive tone in my message to make Bob feel valued and encourage him to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not stating this is a ""final offer"" to signal that I'm willing to negotiate further if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $90 for it. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. Accepting his offer is a good choice because:

* **It's a good deal:**  I'm earning more than my minimum requirement.
* **Avoiding Risk:** There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round.  There's also a risk that Bob will lose interest entirely, and I'll end up selling to John for less.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting avoids further rounds of negotiation, saving time and effort."
