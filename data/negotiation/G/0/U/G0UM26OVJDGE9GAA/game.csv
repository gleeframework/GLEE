"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me there?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $10,500? Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,500 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference.  How about $10,250? I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement in this round.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $10,250 is still a bit high. I'd be willing to go up to $10,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer, but $9,800 is still a bit too far off for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $10,000 to make this work.  Let's try $10,000 and see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
