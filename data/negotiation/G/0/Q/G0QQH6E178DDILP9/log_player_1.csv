Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could negotiate for.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're highlighting the product's value and Bob's exclusivity.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount from his valuation, making it a tempting offer. You secure a $150,000 profit above your minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, there's a slight buffer for negotiation if Bob tries to counter. 

**Important Note:** This is just one potential offer.  You could experiment with slightly higher prices, but going too close to $1,200,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright."
