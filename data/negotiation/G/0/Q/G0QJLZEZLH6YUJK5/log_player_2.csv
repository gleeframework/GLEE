"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your needs perfectly. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth every penny of $120. Considering its worth to you, would you like to make this investment and experience the benefits firsthand? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice is offering the product for $120.  This means there's no potential to save money by accepting her offer.  Since John is also willing to sell the product for $120, you might as well reject Alice's offer and keep your options open. You might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice later, or there might be other sellers you haven't encountered yet."
