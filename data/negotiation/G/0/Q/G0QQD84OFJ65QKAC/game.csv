"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the product's exceptional value and potential. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my top price for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below what I need to move forward. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  I believe this price reflects the unique value of the product while also being fair to both of us.  What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $1,050,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your coming up to $950,000. However, we're still a bit apart. I understand this product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to compromise to close the deal. How about we split the difference and agree on $975,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges the value we both see in this product.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, and propose $925,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
