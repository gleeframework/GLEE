"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the product's exceptional value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards and still secure a profitable deal. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's high value to me to justify the initial price. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  My message encourages Bob to engage in a dialogue, rather than just presenting a hard-line price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my top price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a better deal. Selling to John right now would guarantee a profit, but I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below what I need to move forward. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  I believe this price reflects the unique value of the product while also being fair to both of us.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating flexibility by offering a counteroffer.
* **Midpoint Approach:**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to my ideal price than Bob's offer, but still within the potential range of a successful deal.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I emphasize the fairness of the proposed price, making it seem like a win-win scenario.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I continue to encourage open communication and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for a lower price yet, and I'm confident I can still get a better deal with Bob or with John.  The risk of not getting a deal with Bob is outweighed by the potential for a higher profit, either by getting a better offer from Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your coming up to $950,000. However, we're still a bit apart. I understand this product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to compromise to close the deal. How about we split the difference and agree on $975,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Value:** I acknowledge Bob's perspective by mentioning the product's value to him. This helps build rapport and shows that I'm considering his position.
* **Splitting the Difference:** I propose splitting the difference between our last two offers. This is a common negotiation tactic that creates a sense of fairness and can encourage a deal. 
* **Emphasize the Deal:**  I reiterate the fact that this offer is a compromise and a chance for us to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, and propose $925,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, we're still not within a range that's profitable for me. Considering the time constraint and the certainty of earning $1,000,000 from John, it's the most sensible option to sell the product to John. I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed profit for the possibility of a slightly higher price from Bob."
