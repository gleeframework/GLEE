{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's also significantly below Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, making it attractive to him.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to take the $700,000, selling to John for $800,000 is a safer bet.  However, there's still potential to get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While it's closer, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a compromise closer to my preferred price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $775,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $812,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 812500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to go up a bit more, how about $790,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that reaching a deal with Bob will be difficult.  John is offering a guaranteed $800,000, which is more than Bob's latest offer and meets my minimum requirements.  It's time to move on and secure a certain sale with John."
