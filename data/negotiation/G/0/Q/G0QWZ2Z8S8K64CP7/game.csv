"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is quite a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm interested in the product but I have a much lower budget in mind. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be worth the investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway. While the product seems great, $14,000 is still above what I'm able to spend. Could you consider $8,000?  I feel that's a fair offer given my budget.",8000.0,Bob,4,
