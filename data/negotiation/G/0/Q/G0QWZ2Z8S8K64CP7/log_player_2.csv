"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm open to discussing the price, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's in your best interest to negotiate down significantly or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is quite a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm interested in the product but I have a much lower budget in mind. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a good starting point to see how much she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Anchoring:** By presenting a lower number first, you're ""anchoring"" the negotiation in your favor. It might make Alice more receptive to a compromise closer to your desired range. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** You've left ample room to increase your offer in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved closer to your range, $14,000 is still significantly above your $8,000 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are several rounds left, giving you time to negotiate further.  
* **John's Offer:** Keep John's $8,000 offer in mind as a potential fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway. While the product seems great, $14,000 is still above what I'm able to spend. Could you consider $8,000?  I feel that's a fair offer given my budget."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Presenting Your Maximum:** Since Alice is aware of your budget limitations, it's time to be upfront about your absolute maximum price ($8,000).
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will reveal if Alice is truly willing to negotiate within a range acceptable to you.
* **Alternative Option:**  It's a good reminder for Alice that you have the option of buying from John for $8,000."
