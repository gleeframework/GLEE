"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $10,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. ",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,000 is still below my minimum. However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This way, we can both walk away satisfied.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in price, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to go down to $9,400 to make this deal happen. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly.",9400.0,Alice,7,
