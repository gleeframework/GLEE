"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a great deal for something worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to see if Bob can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within his budget. This shows he's serious about buying but wants a better price. It also gives Alice room to negotiate down without losing too much value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $14,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but $16,000 is still above Bob's ideal. He can likely get a better price with more negotiation. It's worth continuing to see if he can secure the product closer to his $15,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $16,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  I'm sure we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate but not willing to give in entirely.  $15,500 is a good compromise point, potentially appealing to Alice while staying within Bob's budget."
