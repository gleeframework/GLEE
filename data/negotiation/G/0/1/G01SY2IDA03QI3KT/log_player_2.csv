"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth more than $8,000 to you. Considering its true worth and your needs, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is a fair price considering what I'm looking for. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You're still closer to your target price of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you more leverage to potentially get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $8,750 for the product, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. Let's try to reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet you halfway. I propose a final price of $8,875 for the product. This reflects a reasonable compromise and allows us to conclude the negotiation satisfactorily. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,875 is a good price, you're still closer to your ideal price of $8,000. With 5 rounds remaining, there's room for negotiation to potentially secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but $8,875 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,250 for the product, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price. "", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I've considered your proposal and am willing to negotiate further. I propose a final price of $8,625 for the product. This is my best offer, reflecting a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,625
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice has come down significantly and you're only $625 over your target price. There are still three rounds left, but it's unlikely Alice will budge much further, and if she does, it's risky to risk going to John and potentially losing the deal entirely."
