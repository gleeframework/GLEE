"Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm sure you'll see the value in it. Let me know your decision.",10500.0,Alice,1,
