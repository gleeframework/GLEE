"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is serious about this purchase and gauge his initial reaction.  If he's not interested at this price, we can work our way down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm holding out for more. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point, especially with the threat of selling to John. This gives me room to negotiate and see if Bob is truly interested."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm coming down to $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable price given the value of the product. I'm testing the waters to see how far Bob is willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum threshold. However, given that I have the option to sell to John for the same price, there is no incentive to continue negotiating with Bob.  This guarantees me a secure sale, saving me the potential risk of further rounds of negotiation."
