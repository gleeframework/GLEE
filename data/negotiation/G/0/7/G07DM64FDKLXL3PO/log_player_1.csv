"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I know the product is worth at least $8000 to me, so $10000 is a reasonable starting point. It's also a price that gives Bob some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I'm confident I can get closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $9,500.  I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, showing I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit.  The longer we negotiate, the higher the risk that he'll walk away or I'll lose my patience and sell to John.  $9,200 is a good compromise."
