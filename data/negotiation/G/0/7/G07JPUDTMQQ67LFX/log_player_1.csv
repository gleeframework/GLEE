{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts by being friendly and suggesting a good deal, while still aiming for a price point above the product's worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation, but also sets a higher initial price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $120, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $135? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $135 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I was thinking more along the lines of $132. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $132 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal, but I won't settle for less than my minimum price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to $135 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $133?  It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 133}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $131? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay under $130 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price but is still below $150. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling for less than what I want. It's time to take the safe option and sell to John for $150."
