Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves me a good profit margin.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell for that low of a price.  I'll counter with a new offer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $900,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's lower than my minimum acceptable price but higher than his initial offer. I'm hoping this compromise will lead to a successful deal."
