Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a middle ground. I still have 8 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price, $775,000 is still below my desired value. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I believe there's still room for a mutually beneficial deal.  I have 6 rounds left to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to lower my price to $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $812,500 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $812,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and is a good compromise. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm confident that this deal is in my best interest. There are only 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
