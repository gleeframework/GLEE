"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $97.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $97.50 is still slightly lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $101.25? It's a fair compromise that lets us both walk away happy.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $101.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $95. How about we meet in the middle of that and $98.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",98.5,Bob,6,
