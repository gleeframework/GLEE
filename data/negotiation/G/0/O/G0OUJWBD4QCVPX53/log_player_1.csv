Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I can do better. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I'm looking to get closer to $105 for this product. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  Let me know if you're willing to come up a bit."", ""product_price"": 105}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $95 is getting closer to what I want, but I still think I can get a bit more. I'll try to convince him to go a little higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to $92.50, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, as $92.5 is pretty close to what I'd like to get.  However,  we're getting close to the end of the negotiation and I'm concerned that Bob might keep lowballing me.  I've already rejected several of his offers, and it's likely he'll continue to resist going higher.  To guarantee that I get a price I'm comfortable with, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
