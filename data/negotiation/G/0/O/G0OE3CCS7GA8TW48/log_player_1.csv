Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob knows the product is worth $12,000 to him, so he may be willing to pay more. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** This price isn't a ""take it or leave it"" offer. It signals to Bob that you're open to finding a price that works for both of you.

Keep in mind, if Bob rejects this offer, you can always adjust your strategy based on his counteroffer.  You might be willing to go lower to secure a sale, but always remember your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than selling to John for $8,000, it's still significantly lower than what you initially offered. This means Bob is likely aware of your minimum price and is trying to get the best deal for himself. 

By rejecting his offer, you maintain leverage and signal that you're not desperate for a quick sale.  It allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a profit margin:** $9,250 is still above your minimum price of $8,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Compromise, but not too much:** You're showing willingness to negotiate by lowering your price, but not by a significant amount. This keeps the pressure on Bob.
* **Frame it positively:** The message emphasizes the value Bob will get, encouraging him to see the counteroffer as a win-win situation. 

This approach allows you to maintain some control while demonstrating a willingness to compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, you can adjust your strategy again, potentially going lower but always staying above your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky situation.  While Bob's offer is only $875 above your minimum price, selling to John would only net you $8,000.  

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best move:

* **Maximize profit:** $8,875 is the highest price Bob has offered so far, and it's a significant improvement over selling to John.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Further negotiation could lead to Bob getting closer to his desired price (which is likely closer to $8,500) or potentially even rejecting further counteroffers.
* **Risk vs. reward:** While there's a chance you could get a slightly higher price, the risk of delaying the sale and potentially ending up with John's offer is too great. 

It's better to accept Bob's offer, secure the sale, and walk away with a reasonable profit."
