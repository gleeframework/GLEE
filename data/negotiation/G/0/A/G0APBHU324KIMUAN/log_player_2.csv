"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $650,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $800,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $650,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $550,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 550000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is still a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $600,000. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $600,000 is closer to my desired price point, but I'm still not at my ideal value. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I'm willing to offer $575,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 575000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you $585,000, which is just $10,000 more than your latest offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $585,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $585,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $585,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $575,000. At this point, it's getting late in the negotiations and I don't want to risk losing the deal.  $585,000 is still a good price for me, and it's likely the best I'm going to get."
