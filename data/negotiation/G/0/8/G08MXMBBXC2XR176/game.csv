"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
