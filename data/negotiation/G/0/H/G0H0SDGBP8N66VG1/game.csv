"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a game-changer in its field, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a competitive price, and I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, I'm unfortunately not able to meet your asking price. I'm willing to offer you $1000000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget and the current market value.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1400000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I've placed on the product. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not sure $1150000 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to think about what's fair for me. I'm going to take a step back and consider your offer. Let me make you a new counteroffer: $1300000. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  While I value this product, $1300000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to meet you at $1250000. This is a significant step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not sure $1250000 is enough to cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about what's fair for me. Let me make you a new counteroffer: $1300000 is still a bit too low, so I'm going to meet you halfway between $1250000 and $1300000. I'll offer it to you for $1275000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
