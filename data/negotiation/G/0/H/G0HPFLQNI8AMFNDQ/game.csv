"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,800,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it. This feels like a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,350,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This acknowledges the value you see while reflecting the product's true worth.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to maximize your profit, but $1,650,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing you a profit while still fitting within my budget. Let's work together to finalize a deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
