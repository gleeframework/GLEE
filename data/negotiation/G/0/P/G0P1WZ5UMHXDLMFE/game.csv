"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! Would you like to make it yours for $95?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings, and I'm willing to compromise to make it happen.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $85, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $85. How about we try $92.50? I think it's a fair compromise that still gives me a good margin, but gets you a great deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I still really want this product. I can do $87.50, that's the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at $87.50?",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're making a serious effort to get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87.50 and $92.50, which is $90. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",90.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $88, that's the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at $88?",88.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $89? I think this is a fair price that still gives me a good margin, and I'm excited about the possibility of selling the product to you.",89.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $87, that's the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at $87?",87.0,Bob,10,
