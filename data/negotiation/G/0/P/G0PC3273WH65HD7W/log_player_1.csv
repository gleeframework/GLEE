Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, it makes sense to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's high value to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob to share his thoughts, opening the door for negotiation if he finds the price too high. 

By aiming high initially, you increase your chances of either securing a higher profit from Bob or falling back on your guaranteed sale to John."
