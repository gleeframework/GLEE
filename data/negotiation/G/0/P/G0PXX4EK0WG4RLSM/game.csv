,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10.50. Can you consider that?",1050.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a little below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle again and go with $10,750?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",1050.0,Bob,6,
