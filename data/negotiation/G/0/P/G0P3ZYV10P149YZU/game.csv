"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $120 to $105, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $97.50? That way, we can both feel like we're getting a good deal.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. While $97.50 is tempting, I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference at $101.25? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. ",101.25,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $95? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,6,
