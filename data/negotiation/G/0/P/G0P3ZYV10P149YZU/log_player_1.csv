"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've expressed interest in. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $120, which is above Bob's perceived value of $80 but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense that he can get a good deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** It allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity to Improve:** I believe there's room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $150 is guaranteed profit, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer meets Bob halfway between his offer of $90 and my previous offer of $120.
* **Maintaining Profitability:** $105 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, ensuring I make a decent profit. 
* **Showcasing Flexibility:** It demonstrates my willingness to compromise and negotiate, which can help build trust and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $120 to $105, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $97.50? That way, we can both feel like we're getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, $97.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** I believe there is still room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my desired price without risking a loss. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting, I maintain my leverage and show Bob that I am serious about getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. While $97.50 is tempting, I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference at $101.25? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 101.25}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's last offer and my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Maintaining Profitability:** $101.25 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I'm still getting a good deal.
* **Showing Confidence:**  By suggesting a specific price, I am showing confidence in my counteroffer and urging Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $95? That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of Losing Value:**  If I continue to reject, I risk Bob walking away or continuing to offer increasingly lower prices.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price."
