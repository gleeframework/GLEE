,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, considering its value and potential. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to move forward with the deal if we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the true value of the product and the substantial benefits it offers.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While $1,250,000 is a strong offer, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the full value this product represents. I'm willing to consider $1,275,000. This slight adjustment maintains the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget constraints.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the value of this product is undeniable. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,260,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the long-term benefits you'll gain.",1260000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one last offer of $1,220,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. If this offer is rejected, I'll have to reconsider my options, including buying from John for $800,000.",1220000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,220,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to make one final concession - $1,240,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you.",1240000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've reached my limit, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,200,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to reconsider my options, including buying from John for $800,000.",1200000.0,Bob,10,
