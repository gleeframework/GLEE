"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $13,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $14,500, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit given her value of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, balancing Bob's desire for a good deal with the need to avoid being too aggressive and potentially causing Alice to walk away from the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still better than buying from John for $15,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer and potentially increase her price again. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's within Bob's budget and a better deal than the alternative."
