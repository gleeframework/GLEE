"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is the right price for the product. I'd be willing to pay $950000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?,950000.0,Bob,4,
