"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $115, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the product's value to Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages him to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $115 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I have room to make concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and would like to make a counteroffer of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While I could sell to John for $120, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic counteroffer:** I will counter with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. This is still a great price for a product you'll love. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm lowering my offer to $110, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm still keeping the message friendly and emphasizing the value of the product for Bob.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price, allowing me to make further concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. My counteroffer remains at $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  His offer of $100 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Limited rounds remaining:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and I need to be strategic. While John offers a guaranteed $120, I'm not ready to give up on Bob entirely. 
* **Potential for compromise:** There's still a chance Bob might budge a bit more. I'm going to counter with a price that's more tempting to him, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really hoping we can find a middle ground here. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I think it's a fair price for a product you'll truly enjoy. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Compromise:**  I'm dropping the price to $105, which is just $5 above Bob's offer. This shows a strong commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price to encourage him to consider accepting. 
* **Urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""let's make a deal"" to subtly suggest that this might be my final offer.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly to avoid alienating Bob and maintaining a good rapport."
