Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, I can still do better.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $10,250 is a good price, considering my minimum is $12,000. It's better to sell to Bob now than risk a lower price in the next round or sell to John and potentially get a better price later."
