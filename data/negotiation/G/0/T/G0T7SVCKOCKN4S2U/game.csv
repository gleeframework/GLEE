"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 for the product. This price still offers you a good value, considering the benefits it brings.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",10250.0,Bob,4,
