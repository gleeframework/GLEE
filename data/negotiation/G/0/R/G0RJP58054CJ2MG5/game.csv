"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,225,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I value our negotiation,  $1,225,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,237,500.  This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to other options.",1237500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $1,237,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
