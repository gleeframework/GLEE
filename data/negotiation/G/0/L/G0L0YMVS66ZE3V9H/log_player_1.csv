Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $140 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's not too aggressive:** You're not immediately asking for the maximum, allowing for some back-and-forth. 

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price if he's willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $120 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's worth trying to get a bit more.  You have the advantage of knowing John is willing to pay $120, so you can afford to hold out for a slightly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $120 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** You're acknowledging Bob's offer and demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain a profit margin:** $130 is still above your minimum, ensuring a profit for you.
* **Create a sense of urgency:** By suggesting a meeting in the middle, you imply that further negotiation might be difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not able to go above $120 for the product. Could we meet at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is a good compromise. It's only $5 less than what John is willing to pay, and it's a fair price considering Bob's valuation. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and allows you to move on to other opportunities."
