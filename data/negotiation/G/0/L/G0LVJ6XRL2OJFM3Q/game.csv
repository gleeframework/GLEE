"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to accept $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come up slightly. How about $1,025,000 and we have a deal?",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to come up on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
