Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to come up on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000.

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  We're now at $1,075,000. The potential savings from further negotiation are getting smaller, while the risk of Alice walking away is increasing.
* **Time is Money:** We've used 7 of our 10 rounds. Continuing to haggle might not yield a significantly better price, and we risk ending up with John's $1,500,000 offer by default.
* **Solid Savings:**  We've already negotiated Alice down $425,000 from her starting price.  That's a significant savings.

This offer represents a good balance between savings and risk."
