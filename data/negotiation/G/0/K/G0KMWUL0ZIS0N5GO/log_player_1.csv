Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested but wants a slightly better price. 
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer since it's much higher than his perceived value ($80). However, it's the best strategy to maximize your potential profit before moving on to the guaranteed sale with John."
