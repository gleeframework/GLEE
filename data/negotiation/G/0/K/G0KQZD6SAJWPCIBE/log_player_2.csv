Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I can't accept a price that low.  How about we split the difference and settle at $850,000? This represents a significant discount from my original asking price and is a very fair offer.
