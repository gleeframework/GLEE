"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident this product is worth significantly more than your initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on price, but that's still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I can't accept a price that low.  How about we split the difference and settle at $850,000? This represents a significant discount from my original asking price and is a very fair offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
