"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000.  Would that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $11,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  $11,500 is still a little too high for my budget though. How about $10,250? That's a fair offer considering John is offering me the same product for $10,000.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
