"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth discussing a price of $14,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that will benefit you greatly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more reasonable price.  Would you consider $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is also a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price that should benefit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $9,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems stuck at a price point too far above your limit. She went up from $11,000 to $11,500, indicating she might not be willing to go much lower.  You've already reached round 5, and further negotiation might not yield a price significantly better than John's offer of $10,000.  It's better to secure the deal with John at this point to avoid potentially missing out."
