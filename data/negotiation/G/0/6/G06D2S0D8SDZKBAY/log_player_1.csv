Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $1,400,000}

This is a reasonable offer, considering the product's value to Bob, and it gives me a decent profit margin. Let's see how Bob responds!"
