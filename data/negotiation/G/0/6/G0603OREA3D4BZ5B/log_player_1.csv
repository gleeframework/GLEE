Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have room to start high.  Offering a price significantly above Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Confidence and Value Highlighting:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob specifically, aiming to justify the high price and create a sense of potential loss if he declines. 
* **Clear Call to Action:**  The message directly asks for Bob's response, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation process.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects the offer, you can gradually decrease your asking price, but never go below your safety net of $1,200,000."
