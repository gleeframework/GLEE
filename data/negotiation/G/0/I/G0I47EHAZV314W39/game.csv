"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth and potential. I'm willing to move down to $900,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
