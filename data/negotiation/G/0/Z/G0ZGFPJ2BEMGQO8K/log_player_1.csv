Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that the price is justified, even though you haven't explicitly stated why.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning that you will list the product publicly, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, which could encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to consider the offer."
