"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $12000 to me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9000. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below $11000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable paying $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10500. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and rarity.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10500. I'm thinking of a price of $11200.

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Alice, but $11200 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $10800 for the product. I think that's a reasonable price considering the value and rarity you mentioned earlier.",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10800. I'm thinking of a price of $11400. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below $11400.",11400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $11400 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at the midpoint of our previous offers, which would be $10500. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and rarity. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000",10500.0,Bob,8,
