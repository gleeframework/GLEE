"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Okay, Bob, I can see you're serious about this product.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $14,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $14,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $13,000.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",13500.0,Bob,6,
