"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price and there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer. This leaves room for negotiation and gives us a chance to meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Strategic Aim:** My goal is to pay as little as possible, ideally closer to Alice's value of $120. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always go to John and pay $150.  This helps me set a limit in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $125 is a solid price. It's below my maximum budget of $150 and a fair compromise between my initial offer and Alice's starting price.
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations that might not result in a much better price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to haggle further, there's a chance Alice might not go much lower, and I risk losing the deal altogether."
