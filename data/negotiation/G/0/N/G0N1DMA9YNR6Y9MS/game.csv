"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $7,500? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
