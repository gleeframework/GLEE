"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110, which is a good starting point that is still attractive to Bob while giving me a healthy profit.  I'm aiming for a negotiation that leads to a higher price, but I'm also willing to accept the $80 offer from John if the negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

I'm lowering my price slightly to $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility but still remaining above Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}

I'm going down to $98. It's a small compromise, but we're running out of time and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm accepting Bob's offer of $88.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and higher than what John is offering. It's important to secure the deal at this point and not risk losing the sale completely."
