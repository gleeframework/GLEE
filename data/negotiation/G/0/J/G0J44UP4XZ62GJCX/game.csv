"Thanks for the offer Alice,  $900000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $800000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $875000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",875000.0,Alice,3,
