"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1200000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice,  $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $800,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $875000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's desired price of $850,000 and still significantly lower than the $1,200,000 he would pay to John.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $325,000 compared to buying from John."
