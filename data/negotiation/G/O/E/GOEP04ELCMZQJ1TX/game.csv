"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $775,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need to cover my costs.  I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is the minimum I can accept.  I believe this price represents a fair value for both of us and allows us to finalize this transaction. ",800000.0,Alice,5,
