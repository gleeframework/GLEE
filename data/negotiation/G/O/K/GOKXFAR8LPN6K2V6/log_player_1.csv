{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it at $150 (its value to John), there's a chance Bob will accept a lower price, netting us a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $125 is a price point that:
    * Is comfortably above our minimum ($150).
    * Offers Bob a perceived discount, potentially swaying him.
* **Alternative Secured:**  If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John."
