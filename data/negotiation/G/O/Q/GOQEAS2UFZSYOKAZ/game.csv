"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $500,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming a bit lower.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $650,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,5,
