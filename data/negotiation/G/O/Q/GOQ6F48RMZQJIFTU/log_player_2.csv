It's a good deal, but Bob can likely get a better price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.

Bob should continue negotiating. While $750,000 is a better price than the initial offer, he can likely still get a better deal. He should try a counteroffer closer to his initial offer of $600,000."

This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. I'm getting close to your offer, but I still need to make a profit.

At this point, Bob should accept Alice's offer.  

* He's already gotten a significant discount from the original asking price and the initial price from John.
*  Further negotiation might result in a slightly lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will get frustrated and walk away, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John at a much higher price.
* It's important to balance the desire for the lowest price with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
