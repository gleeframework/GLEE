Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** I'm offering a price close to Alice's minimum value, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This shows I'm serious about buying but also want to get a good deal.
* **Leaving space for compromise:** This price allows for a few rounds of back and forth without either of us getting stuck. 
* **Staying within my budget:**  This offer is comfortably within my $15,000 limit, ensuring I don't overpay."

* **I can keep trying.** With several rounds left, I can continue negotiating and see if Alice will come down to a more reasonable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer, but still too high.** While it's lower than previous offers, it's still outside of my ideal price range.
* **I have time to negotiate.**  We're only halfway through the rounds, and I can continue pushing for a better price.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** I'm still hoping to get a better deal with Alice, as buying from John would be my last option."

* **Testing Alice's boundaries:** This offer is close to the middle ground between our current positions, and it's a good way to see if Alice is ready to meet in the middle.
* **Staying within budget:** I'm still comfortable with this offer, leaving some room for potential concessions in later rounds if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

* **We have a few rounds left.** There's still time to try to negotiate a lower price.
* **John is always an option.** If I can't get a better deal with Alice, I can always buy from John, but I want to exhaust all negotiation options first."

* **Testing the limits:** It's a significant increase from my last offer, signaling that I'm getting closer to my maximum.
* **Close to the limit:** This offer is close to my budget, leaving very little room for further concessions. It puts pressure on Alice to accept.

```

**Reasoning:**
