"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for considering my previous offer.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $975,000? I think that's a fair price.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see you're willing to pay $975,000, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
