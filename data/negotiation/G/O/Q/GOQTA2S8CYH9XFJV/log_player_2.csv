This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is right:** You're getting the product for $175,000 less than John's price and a good amount below your initial maximum.
* **""Final offer"" signal:** While Alice might not strictly stick to this, it suggests she's getting close to her limit.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Further haggling might make Alice reconsider or you might miss out on the deal entirely."
