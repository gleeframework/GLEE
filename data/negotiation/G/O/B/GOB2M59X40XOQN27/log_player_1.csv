Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Let me know if you're interested in proceeding at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
