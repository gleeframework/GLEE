"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I think you'd be willing to pay around $120 for it, but I'm feeling generous today. How about we settle on $110? Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $110 is less than your maximum budget of $120 and cheaper than buying from John for $120. This meets your goal of saving money."
