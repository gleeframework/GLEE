"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's worth discussing a price of $15,000, considering its worth to you is $8,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $9,000 is a more reasonable price. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Could we possibly settle around $7,500?  I feel that would be a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $8,500 is the minimum I can accept. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
