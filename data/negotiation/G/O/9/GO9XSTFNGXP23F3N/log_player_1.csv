Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's losing out.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves you room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects the offer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** $12,000 is a significant discount from your minimum, showing you're open to a deal. 

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, you increase your chances of getting a good price while keeping the option of selling to John for your minimum if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum value of $15,000. You have a better chance of getting closer to your target price by counteroffering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```
 
This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:** Shows you're willing to negotiate but not give away too much.
* **Is lower than your initial offer:** Shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Provides a specific number:**  Avoids being too vague and makes it clear what you're looking for.

By using a counteroffer, you maintain control of the negotiation and keep the possibility of selling to John for $15,000 if Bob refuses to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit far from it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is still less than your ideal price, it's significantly closer to your minimum value of $15,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in a higher price, but there's a risk that he'll walk away or that you'll spend too much time on the negotiation.  At this point, accepting Bob's offer ensures you get a decent price for the product and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
