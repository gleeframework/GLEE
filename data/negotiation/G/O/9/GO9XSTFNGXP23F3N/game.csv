"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit far from it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
