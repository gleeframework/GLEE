Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your perspective, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer. I am unable to lower the price below $1,100,000 due to the value we place on this product. However, I am open to discussing other terms or conditions that might benefit both parties.

Alice is holding firm at $1,100,000. While this is a better price than John's, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has 7 rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to budge a bit.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue the negotiation process."
