"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Based on your needs and its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming high to maximize profit. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, starting closer to that figure gives us room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving Negotiation Space:** We don't want to start too high and scare Bob off.  Offering $950,000 leaves room for him to counteroffer and still allows us to potentially secure a deal above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and frames the price as ""fair,"" encouraging Bob to engage in a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 to purchase the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While his counteroffer was expected, we need to steer the negotiation back towards a more reasonable range. We'll reject this offer and prepare a counteroffer for Round 3."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. Would you consider $900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** We're acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while firmly stating that $750,000 is unacceptable. 
* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:** We're making a substantial drop from our initial offer ($950,000 to $900,000) to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. However, we're staying well above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Focus on Value:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and encourage Bob to move closer to our range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $850,000 to purchase the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price and represents a significant profit. While we could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
