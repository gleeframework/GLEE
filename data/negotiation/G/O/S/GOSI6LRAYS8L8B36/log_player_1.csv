"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more to me than that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum threshold, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $7,000? That's a significant step up from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, but I'll be mindful of the remaining rounds and John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  I'm willing to come down to $7,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my desired range, I'm not ready to accept yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close. Let's try $7,400. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 7400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer, take it or leave it.  I'm willing to pay $7,300.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is close, but I've only got two rounds left. It's not worth the risk of rejecting his offer and potentially ending up with nothing. Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids any further negotiation."
