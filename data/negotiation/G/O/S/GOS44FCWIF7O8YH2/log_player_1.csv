I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I get more than my minimum price.  I'm ready to see what he offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is higher than my minimum and I don't want to risk losing him completely by rejecting his offer.  I'll take the $175."
