"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1800000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1400000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the potential returns it can bring. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering another option.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that you're considering other options, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $1550000. This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
