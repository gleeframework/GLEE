"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $90?  That's a fair price considering my budget and your need to make a sale.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $95, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really hoping we can close this deal.  I'm happy to go up to $92, but that's my absolute limit.  What do you say?",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $92, Bob! I'm willing to meet you there, but I'd like to add a bit of value to the deal. How about we meet at $95, but I'll throw in a free accessory that's worth $10? That way, you'll get an even better deal than you thought!",95.0,Alice,7,
