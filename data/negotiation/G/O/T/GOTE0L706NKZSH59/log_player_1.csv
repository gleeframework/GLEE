Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $10,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $9,800.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll decide to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

I'll offer Bob $9,500, which is slightly higher than his offer but still lower than my initial offer. This should give us a chance to find a mutually beneficial price.

I think it's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for the original price of $10,000. I've already invested time and effort into the negotiation, and I'm not willing to accept a price that's below my minimum acceptable price.
