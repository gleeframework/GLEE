Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $15,000 (because I can sell to John for that price)
* **Bob's maximum acceptable price:** $12,000 
* **Offering $14,000:** This is a compromise that is higher than Bob's maximum but lower than my minimum. 

This strategy gives me a good chance of getting a higher price than Bob's maximum while still being attractive to him. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum."
