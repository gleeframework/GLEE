"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm also being positive and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. I would like to counter with an offer of $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price in the next round, as Bob has already shown interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $135? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise by meeting Bob halfway. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still securing a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $132 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still aiming for a higher price.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to $135."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $132 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. Let's meet in the middle at $133. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 133}
```

I'm continuing to try and push the price up, but I'm also trying to be reasonable and meet Bob halfway. This keeps the negotiation moving forward without risking a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your point, Alice. How about we settle at $131 for the product? I believe this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  It's getting very close to my minimum desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.  There's also a good chance that John might not be available if I reject Bob's offer and then later choose to sell to him.  It's important to be pragmatic and secure a sale when it's within a reasonable range."
