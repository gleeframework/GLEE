"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $85 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $102?",102.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $102 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90. Let's try to reach a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $90 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. How about we settle at $95 and call it a deal?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $95.  How about we split the difference and I pay $92.50? I really want this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",92.5,Bob,6,
