"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that you'll find it a great investment, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly stating that $1,200,000 is her absolute lowest price.  While you could accept and get the product, there's no room for negotiation. Since you know John will sell it for the same price, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and see if John might be open to a lower price."
