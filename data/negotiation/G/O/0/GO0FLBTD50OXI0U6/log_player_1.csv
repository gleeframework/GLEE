Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more than $105."
