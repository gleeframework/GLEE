"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment, and I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering $10750. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",10750.0,Alice,5,
