"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $107.50, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",107.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $107.50 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair compromise.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,4,
