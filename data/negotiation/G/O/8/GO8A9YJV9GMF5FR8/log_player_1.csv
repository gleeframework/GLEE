Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but not too high to scare Bob off immediately. I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, allowing us to negotiate a mutually acceptable price. If he doesn't, I can always go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I could accept it and avoid further negotiation, I'm confident I can do better. I'm going to counteroffer, hoping to find a price closer to my minimum. If he doesn't budge, I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate and will come up with a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
