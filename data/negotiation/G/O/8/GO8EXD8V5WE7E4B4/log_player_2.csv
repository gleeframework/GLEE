"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000, as Alice values it at $10,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a better strategy than accepting or buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still higher than the $11,000 you offered.  While the product is worth $15,000 to you, it's worth less to Alice, and you can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to your maximum price.  However, it's still higher than your last counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially get you a better price, but there's also a risk that you'll end up paying even more than $13,000 or that the negotiation will drag on.  Buying from John guarantees you'll have the product for $15,000, which is within your budget."
