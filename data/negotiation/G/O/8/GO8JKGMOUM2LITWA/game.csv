"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $950,000. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential of the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $900,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our negotiation.",875000.0,Bob,4,
