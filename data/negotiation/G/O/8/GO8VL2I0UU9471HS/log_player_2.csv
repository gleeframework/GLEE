"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above his target of $1,000,000. It makes sense to see if he can negotiate a lower price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his desired price. Bob has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to see if he can get a slightly better deal from Alice before committing to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,025,000. This represents a significant step towards your price, and I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1,062,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still unwilling to come down to a price Bob is comfortable with.  At this point, Bob has exhausted his negotiation options and is running out of rounds.  It's more beneficial to buy from John for $1,000,000 to ensure he gets the product at his desired price point."
