Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to your ideal.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" and another potential buyer (even if not explicitly stated), you encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your offer.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating your minimum, framing the price with ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth a significant amount. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can always adjust your price slightly downward during the negotiation, but remember your bottom line is $15,000."
