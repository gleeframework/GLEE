"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a bit low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,125,000. This price still allows me a decent profit, and I believe it's fair given the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
