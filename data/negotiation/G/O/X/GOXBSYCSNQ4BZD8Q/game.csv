"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be willing to lower the price to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm confident the product's value will exceed that for you, and I'd be happy to revisit the price at $1,100,000. This would allow me to accommodate your budget while still ensuring a fair return on my investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
