Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I've started with a price of $200, which is a significant mark-up from my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $175? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $175 is more than my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $175 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $185.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 185}
``` 
I'm offering $185, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $185 is a good price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $180? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I'd initially hoped, it's close to my desired price and it seems like Bob is serious about wanting the product. It's more likely that I'll get a better price from Bob than from John."
