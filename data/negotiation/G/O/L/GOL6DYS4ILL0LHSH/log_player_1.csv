Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I can get out of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to a mutually beneficial deal."
