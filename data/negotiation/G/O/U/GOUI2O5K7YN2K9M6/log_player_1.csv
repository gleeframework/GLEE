"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I know it's a valuable item, and I'm confident it's worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I still have time to counter and negotiate with Bob, and I don't want to rush into a deal that leaves me feeling unsatisfied."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a great price for a product like this, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet you at $16,000. I would like to propose $14,000 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him up a bit more in the next round. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $15,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I am still not able to meet you at $15,000. I would like to propose $14,500 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I've had a few rounds of negotiation, and I'm not confident I can push Bob any higher.  John is willing to pay my asking price, so it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
