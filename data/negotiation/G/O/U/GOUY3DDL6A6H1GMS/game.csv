"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to go down to $1,100,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? It's still a significant discount for you and gets us closer to closing the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1,087,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1087500.0,Bob,4,
