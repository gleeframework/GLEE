"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I think this price is more reasonable considering the product's value to me is $8,000. Can you consider this offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $10,200 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm confident that this price is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting stuck in a loop here. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're still interested, let's make a deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate at this point. I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need you to meet me at $10,000. If you're not willing to do that, I think it's time to walk away.",10000.0,Alice,9,
