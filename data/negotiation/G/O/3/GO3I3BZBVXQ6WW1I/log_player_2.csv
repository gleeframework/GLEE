"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1400000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it provides will far exceed the price. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details further.  If you decide to pass, I'll be selling it to another buyer, but I'm willing to give you first priority. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
