Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, Alice subtly anchors Bob's perception of the price. 
* **Alternative Option:** While not explicitly stated, the fact that Alice has another buyer (John) provides a subtle sense of urgency and competition. 
 
**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her price during the negotiation."
