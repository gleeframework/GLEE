"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a little too steep for me. I'm firm on $9,500.  This is my final offer, so let me know if we can strike a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on $9,500, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,800, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. If we can agree on that price, we have a deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
