"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $115 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference at $107.50?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $112.50, but that's really my bottom line.  This product is truly worth it, and I think this price reflects both its value and your budget.  Let me know if this works for you.",112.5,Alice,5,
