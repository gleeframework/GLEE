Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($150). This gives Bob some room to negotiate and encourages him to engage.
* **Leaving Room:**  By offering $130, I leave room for potential counteroffers without immediately risking a rejection or having to go down to John's offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport and keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm confident I can get a higher price. Bob has already shown interest and acknowledged the product's value. A counteroffer could potentially lead to a more profitable agreement. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** While I'm open to negotiating with Bob, I have a guaranteed alternative with John's offer of $150. This gives me leverage in the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but still below my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a profitable price for me. 
* **Highlight value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer and keep the negotiation focused on the product's worth. 
* **Maintain positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion, aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $115 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference at $107.50?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob is showing willingness to compromise, $107.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a higher price:** I believe there is still room for negotiation. Bob has expressed interest in the product and has been willing to increase his offer.  A counteroffer could lead to a more favorable outcome. 
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  I can confidently reject Bob's offer because I have a guaranteed alternative with John's offer of $150.  This gives me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $112.50, but that's really my bottom line.  This product is truly worth it, and I think this price reflects both its value and your budget.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle (almost):**  I'm proposing a price that is closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasizing value and budget:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value while acknowledging his budget constraints. This positions the offer as a win-win.
* **Setting a firm bottom line:** I'm making it clear that $112.50 is my lowest acceptable price, increasing the likelihood of acceptance and avoiding further negotiation rounds."
