"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1600000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1550000. Can you meet me at that price?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $1550000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $1650000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that this product is not worth more than $1500000, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll meet you at $1500000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept this price?",1500000.0,Bob,6,
