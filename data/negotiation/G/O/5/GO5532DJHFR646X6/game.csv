"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $850,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the significant value this product will bring to your business.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $875,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to be mindful of your budget, but $875,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product provides.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000, which is a significant concession on my part.  Let's reach an agreement that benefits us both.",925000.0,Alice,5,
