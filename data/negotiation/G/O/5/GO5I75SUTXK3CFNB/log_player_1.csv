Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,700,000. This is a higher price than what it's worth to him, but it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I believe this gives him some room to negotiate, but also allows me to secure a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm countering with $1,400,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to cut my losses and move on.  Selling to John ensures I reach my minimum goal."
