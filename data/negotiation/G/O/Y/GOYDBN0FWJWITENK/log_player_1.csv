"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum value but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I'm open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $120 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or sell to John for a higher price. I'll counteroffer Bob again and see where that leads."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $110 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I'm trying to be reasonable here, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the price."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go up to $115, but I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. That's as high as I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum price, and we've reached round 6. The risk of further negotiation is too high, as we are getting closer to the deadline and there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer.  I'm better off selling to John for $150 and securing a guaranteed profit."
