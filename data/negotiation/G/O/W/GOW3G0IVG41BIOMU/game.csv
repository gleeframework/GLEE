"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on this product.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I acknowledge your budget, $10,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this item.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is my final offer, considering the limited time we have.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
