"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice, as I can get the product from John for a guaranteed $1,000,000.  While I would prefer to save even more money, securing the product at this price is a good outcome."
