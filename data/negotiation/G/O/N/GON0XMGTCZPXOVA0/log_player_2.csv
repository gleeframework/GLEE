"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her minimum acceptable price, giving you room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. While I see the value in this product, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $1,300,000.  Let me know if this is a price you're willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob.  While that price is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still a good deal for me, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer allows me to acquire the product at a price I'm comfortable with.  While further negotiation might be possible, the potential savings are not substantial enough to risk losing the deal with Alice."
