"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's offer is at your maximum price point, it's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price. There's no downside to rejecting the first offer and trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  A $2000 drop from Alice's initial offer is a significant reduction, showing your serious intent to negotiate.
* **Fairness Focus:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair"" price for both parties, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of equity.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to $10,000, allowing for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:**  Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, lowering the price by $1,000. This shows her willingness to compromise.
* **Close to Target:** $11,000 is only $1,000 above your desired price of $10,000. Accepting saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Further negotiation could potentially get you a slightly lower price, but there's a risk of Alice walking away or the negotiations dragging on.  

Given that you're already close to your target and have a solid backup option, it's sensible to accept this offer."
