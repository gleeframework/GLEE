,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about $10,500? I'm sure we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think the product is worth it. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $11,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $14,000, which would be $12,500. This is my final offer for now.",12500.0,Alice,5,
