Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a price of $175 offers a reasonable markup while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still above your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While we know Bob values the product at $150, he might not be willing to pay that much. A successful negotiation involves understanding both sides.
* **Alternative Strategies:** Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to secure a deal with Bob specifically, you could:
    * Offer a lower price initially to increase the chances of acceptance.
    * Employ different negotiation tactics, such as highlighting the product's value."
