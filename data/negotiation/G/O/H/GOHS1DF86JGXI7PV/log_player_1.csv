Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, I'm offering it at that price. This ensures I get the maximum possible value for the product while still ensuring Bob is willing to buy it. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for the same amount, so there's no risk in offering the lowest possible price that guarantees a sale."
