{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

We've been negotiating for a while, and it seems Alice is not willing to go lower. We're approaching our limit with only two rounds left. It's better to take the safe option and buy from John.  While $1,500,000 isn't ideal, it's still within our budget, and we can avoid further negotiation."
