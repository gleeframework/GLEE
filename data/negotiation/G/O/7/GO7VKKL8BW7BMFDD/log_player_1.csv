Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  This ensures you make a decent profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It sets the tone for a potential win-win:**  You want Bob to feel motivated to work with you, not just walk away.

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still far from the value you want to get for the product.  It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can get a better offer from Bob. You can make a counteroffer, hopefully finding a price point where both of you are happy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is below what I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,050,000? This gives you a significant saving compared to your estimated value, and allows me to secure a fair return.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates your willingness to compromise, which is essential for successful negotiation.
* **Present a strong argument:** It highlights the benefits of the deal for Bob, emphasizing his potential savings.
* **Maintain a high price:**  While lower than your initial offer, $1,050,000 is still a significant amount and keeps the value for you. 

Let's see if Bob is ready to meet you halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's work towards a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision, but accepting Bob's offer at $950,000 is the best option at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant profit:** While not your initial goal, $950,000 is a substantial amount of money and a good profit margin for you.
* **Risk of losing a deal:** Continuing negotiations risks Bob walking away completely, leaving you with only John's $800,000 offer.
* **No guarantee of a better offer:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a higher price. 

It's important to weigh the potential gains against the risk of losing the deal.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of a worse outcome."
