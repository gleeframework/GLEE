"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $1,200,000 is still significantly more than the product's value to Alice ($800,000).
* **Counter-offering gives you leverage.** By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price. 
* **John's price is a safety net.**  You have an alternative if negotiations with Alice fail, so you're not pressured to accept a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower the price significantly:**  This initial counteroffer makes a strong statement that you're serious about getting a better deal.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  $900,000 is still above Alice's value, suggesting a possible middle ground. 
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  The message emphasizes finding common ground, demonstrating a cooperative approach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is below what I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,050,000? This gives you a significant saving compared to your estimated value, and allows me to secure a fair return.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial price, $1,050,000 is still considerably higher than what the product is worth to her. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** You can likely get the price down even further. Rejecting her offer shows you're not afraid to walk away and encourages her to make a more reasonable offer. 
* **John's price remains a safety net.**  This gives you the flexibility to be patient and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's work towards a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Continued Compromise:**  By increasing your offer from $900,000 to $950,000, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate.
* **Stay Below Alice's Value:**  $950,000 is still under Alice's value of $800,000, giving you a good margin for potential profit.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:**  The message highlights that the proposed deal is fair for both of you, encouraging Alice to see the value of closing the deal."
