"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is below what I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,050,000? This gives you a significant saving compared to your estimated value, and allows me to secure a fair return.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's work towards a final agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
