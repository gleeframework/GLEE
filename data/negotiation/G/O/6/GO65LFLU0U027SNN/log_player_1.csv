Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering its potential value to me and the potential savings I can offer you.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, so let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
