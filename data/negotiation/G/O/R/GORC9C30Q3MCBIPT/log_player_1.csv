Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also likely to be attractive to Bob since it's below his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $11,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $12,000?  This is still a good deal for you, as you're getting the product for less than its value to you.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer is very close to my desired price.  It's a fair compromise and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's also a significant improvement over selling to John."
