"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is significantly lower. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob, but $8000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget. How about $10000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to move forward with the purchase.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but $10000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $14000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,5,
