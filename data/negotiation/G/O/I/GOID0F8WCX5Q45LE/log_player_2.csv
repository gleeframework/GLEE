"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob, but $8000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget. How about $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but $10000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $14000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $14,000 is still above your budget.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $8,000, it's best to stop negotiating with Alice and purchase from John."
