"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,050,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Let's try $1,000,000. This price allows us both to walk away with a fair deal.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear you, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I can justify right now.  I'm prepared to pay $1,025,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good starting point for a final agreement. Let's make this deal happen!",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can meet you at $1,030,000. This is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
