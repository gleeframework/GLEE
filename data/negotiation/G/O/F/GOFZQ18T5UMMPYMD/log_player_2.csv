"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it's still within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation.  It shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, you're still aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer again allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to your initial counteroffer of $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's offer of $11,000 and your previous offer of $10,500. It shows Alice you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming to get a price closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,900? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer is very close to your target price and is a significant improvement from her initial offer.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a further price drop, but it's also risky. You've already rejected two of her offers, and there's no guarantee she'll keep lowering the price.  Accepting her offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
