"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, the product is worth a lot to me, and I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. That said, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle on $720,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $720,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $900,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product at this price.",900000.0,Alice,5,
