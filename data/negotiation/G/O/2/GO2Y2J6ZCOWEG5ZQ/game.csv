"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. My asking price is $1,150,000. This allows me to make a good profit while still giving you a significant discount. Consider this a one-time opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know if you're interested.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
