"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $125 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a bit out of my price range.  Let's try $130. I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $130. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $138. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",138.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $138 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $133.  This is my final offer.",133.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $138. I'm willing to give you a small concession and offer you $136. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal.",136.0,Alice,7,
