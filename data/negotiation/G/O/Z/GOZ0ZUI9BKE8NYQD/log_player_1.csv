Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000? That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you have a budget, but $11,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,500. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
