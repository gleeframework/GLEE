"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a more substantial offer. How about $1,050,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you can still benefit from.  Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This price is fair considering the product's value to both of us.  I believe it's in your best interest to consider this offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I may need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
