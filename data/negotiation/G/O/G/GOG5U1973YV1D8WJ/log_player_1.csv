"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120) but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a possible deal in the first round while giving me space to increase the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $60 is way too low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $80.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
