Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $18,000."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a potentially high profit. 
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value, subtly justifying the high price without revealing my minimum. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By stating it's an ""initial price,"" I signal openness to negotiation and counteroffers from Bob. 
* **Alternative Option:** I keep in mind my alternative buyer (John) at $12,000.  If Bob's offers get too low, I'm prepared to walk away and take the guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His immediate jump to his maximum suggests he might be willing to go a bit higher. I'll counter with a price closer to my target, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I've significantly reduced my price from $18,000 to $15,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Holding Ground:**  I'm still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum, as I believe the product holds that value.
* **Encouraging Movement:** This counteroffer encourages Bob to potentially move up from his $12,000 offer if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Bob has met me halfway between our previous offers. This price is a significant amount above my minimum ($12,000) and represents a good profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a favorable deal.
* **Time Value:**  Reaching an agreement sooner rather than later has its own value. It avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and allows me to move on."
