"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,800,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to meet you closer to your number. How about we settle on $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,650,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,525,000? This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to finalize the deal.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
