"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm willing to make a special offer of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other potential buyers.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is below her perceived value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and what John is offering. You have a better alternative available."
