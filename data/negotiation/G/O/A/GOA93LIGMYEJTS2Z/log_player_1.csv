Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $100 but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will find the product valuable enough to consider my offer, and it gives me a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $110 is a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum price of $100.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, or that I'll end up selling to John for $100.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
