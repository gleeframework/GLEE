"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its market value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counteroffer process, potentially securing a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $850,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $900000. This product is a unique opportunity and I'm confident it will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $950,000 to $875,000. This is a significant decrease, and Bob is getting closer to his desired price. While there's still room for negotiation, accepting the offer is a good move in this round. Here's why:

* **Good Price:** $875,000 is a good price for Bob, as it's within his budget and significantly less than John's offer.
* **Risk of Rejection:** If Bob rejects the offer and makes a counteroffer, Alice could potentially reject it. This could lead to a back-and-forth negotiation, wasting time and potentially ending up with a higher price than the current offer.
* **Potential for Future Negotiation:** Even if Bob accepts this offer, there's always the possibility of negotiating a lower price on future purchases or services from Alice, building a relationship for potential future savings."
