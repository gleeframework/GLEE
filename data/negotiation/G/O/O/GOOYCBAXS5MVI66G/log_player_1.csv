Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is higher than my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer if Bob is truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$120 is too low for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $175. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial price. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages Bob to come up in his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum value. There's no point in rejecting and continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $150."
