""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly lower than Bob's valuation allows room for negotiation (if needed) while still securing a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer guarantees a minimum earning of $800,000, but the focus is to capitalize on Bob's higher valuation."
