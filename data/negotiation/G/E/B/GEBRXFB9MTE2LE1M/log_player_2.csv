"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get a better price by counter-offering. While $1,200,000 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,050,000? This would still give you a great deal and allow me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1300000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still get a better price by counter-offering.  While $1,300,000 is better than John's price, it's still higher than Bob's initial goal of saving as much money as possible."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,150,000. This price is fair to both of us, and would allow me to secure the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1275000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At this point, Alice has come down to $1,275,000.  This is a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000.  While Bob could try to counter-offer again, it's likely Alice won't budge further, and he might risk losing the deal altogether."
