Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice is coming down, but she's met your offer exactly at your alternative price with John. There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, so it's best to accept and avoid potentially overpaying."
