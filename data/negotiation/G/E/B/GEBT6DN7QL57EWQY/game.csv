"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
