"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating further. 

The strategy is to leverage the fact that Alice values the product at $1,200,000 and is willing to sell it for less than that. By rejecting the initial offer, Bob opens the door for counteroffers and potential further discounts."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is only $75,000 more than what Bob can get from John.  At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings of a few thousand dollars. It's a good deal for Bob, and he should accept the offer to secure the product."
