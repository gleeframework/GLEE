Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum price of $12,000. It's the best I can do, knowing the product is worth that much to me. If Bob rejects, I have the option to sell to John, which ensures I get my minimum value. However, I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $9,000, it's below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm countering with $11,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still a price that allows me to make a profit and is closer to my minimum value.  I believe this is a fair compromise and will be more appealing to Bob than his initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge much on his price.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  his offer of $8,500 is simply too low. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000. I'm guaranteed my minimum value and avoid further rounds of negotiation that might result in an even lower price."
