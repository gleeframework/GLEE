Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and market potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You start by highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""unique value."" This framing emphasizes what Bob stands to gain.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number; you're anchoring it to the ""market potential"" of the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer is still within the ZOPA and allows for some back-and-forth if Bob wants to negotiate.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a strategy for how you will respond."
