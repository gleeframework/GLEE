"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I'm open to further discussion if you're interested.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us,  $1,100,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
