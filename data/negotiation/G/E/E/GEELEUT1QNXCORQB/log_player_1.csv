Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you'd be happy with $100 from John, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for slightly less than its value to you ($95 instead of $100) creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts. Bob gets a $5 discount, and you make more than the $80 he values it at.
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is direct and highlights the offer as a ""deal,"" subtly encouraging Bob to accept."
