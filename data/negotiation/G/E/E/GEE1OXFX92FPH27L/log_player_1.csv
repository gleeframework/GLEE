Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't pay more than $100 for it. Would you consider accepting this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your position. I'd like to stay firm at $100 as that aligns better with my budget. Can we meet at this price?

While I could push for more, Bob is firm at $100, and that's my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing him and getting the same amount from John."
