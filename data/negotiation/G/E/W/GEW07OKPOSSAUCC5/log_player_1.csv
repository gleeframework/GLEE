Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's profitable.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, implying scarcity (""before I list it publicly"") creates a sense of urgency and potential loss if he misses out. 
* **Clean and Direct:** The message is clear and concise, focusing on the offer and encouraging a response from Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. Offering it at $20,000 means he needs to perceive additional value to justify the higher price. 
* **Negotiation:** This offer assumes there's room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice needs to be prepared to adjust her price or walk away. 
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer gives Alice leverage. She doesn't *have* to sell to Bob below her minimum."
