"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can get a slightly better price. I'll counter with a price closer to $17,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $16,500. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will convince Bob to meet me in the middle and close the deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $16,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, we're running out of rounds and $16,000 is a decent deal. It's significantly higher than what I would get from John, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
