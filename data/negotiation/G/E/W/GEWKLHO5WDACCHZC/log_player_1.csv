{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a standard negotiation tactic to leave room for compromise. I'm also aware of John's offer, which gives me a baseline for the minimum I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to make a sale, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm reducing my price from $180 to $120. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'll reject Bob's offer again and see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly.  This demonstrates further compromise while still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to close the deal."
