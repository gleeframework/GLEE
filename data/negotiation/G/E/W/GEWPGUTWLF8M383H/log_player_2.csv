"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than John's, you're still paying more than the product is worth to you ($120). Since you can get the product for your maximum price ($120) from John, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
