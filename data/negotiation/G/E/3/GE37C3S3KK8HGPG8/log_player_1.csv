Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but not outrageous. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still not quite there yet. Would you consider $13,000? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering $13,000, which is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer. I'm also signaling that this is my final offer to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $13000. Would you be willing to meet me at $12800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $12,800. While it's still below my initial target, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and closer to my desired outcome than selling to John for $12,000."
