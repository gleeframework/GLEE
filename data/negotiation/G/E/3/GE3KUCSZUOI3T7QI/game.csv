"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer. While I acknowledge the value you've highlighted, $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, however, and propose a price of $900,000. This reflects the significant value the product holds for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's continue this discussion and find a solution that works for us both.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I still think $900,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase if we can agree on this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. While I value your perspective, $850,000 still falls below my minimum price.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering a final counteroffer of $875,000.  This reflects the value we both see in the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's conclude this negotiation and finalize the deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to compromise. I propose a counteroffer of $860,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $1,000,000.",860000.0,Bob,6,
