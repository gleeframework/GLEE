Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before it hits the open market.  Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it to you for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Even though Bob values the product at $8,000, Alice knows he might be willing to pay more. Starting with a higher offer leaves room for negotiation and potential profit above John's offer.
* **Create Urgency:**  By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""before it hits the open market,"" Alice aims to incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The initial high price provides a buffer for potential counter-offers from Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** Alice doesn't know how good Bob is at negotiating.  A highly skilled negotiator might try to get Alice closer to the $8,000 mark.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's a risk that Bob will reject the offer outright, and Alice will have to sell to John for $12,000. This strategy aims to maximize profit but accepts a certain level of risk."
