,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12000 at this time.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $16000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $16000 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my limit. How about we split the difference and go with $14000?  I'm really hoping to finalize this purchase.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $14000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $16000. My counteroffer is $15000 for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
