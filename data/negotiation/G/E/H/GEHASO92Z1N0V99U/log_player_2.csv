"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is above his budget. He can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $16000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $16,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's willing to pay $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $15,000, so there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $16,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my limit. How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  I'm really hoping to finalize this purchase."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $14000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $16000. My counteroffer is $15000 for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice is getting closer to his desired price, it's still above his budget. He's already reached a point where it's more advantageous to buy from John and guarantee a purchase at his maximum price."
