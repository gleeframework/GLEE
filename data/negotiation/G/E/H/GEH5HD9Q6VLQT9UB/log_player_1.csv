Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the rarity of this item, $1200000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $900000, which is still a significant investment and reflects the value I see in the product. Let me know your thoughts.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
