"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $115. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Even if you fail, you can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. You're willing to pay up to $120, so a $110 offer is still within your budget and leaves some room for Alice to profit while you save some money."
