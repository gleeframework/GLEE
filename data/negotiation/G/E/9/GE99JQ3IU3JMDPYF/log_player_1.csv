Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This is a strategic offer:

* **Higher than John's offer:** I'm aiming for a profit above the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.
* **Not too high:**  I want to make it enticing for Bob, but not unreasonable. 

By setting the price at $1,500,000, I'm hoping to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and giving Bob a good deal if he values the product higher than $1,200,000."
