"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is within your budget, it's still higher than Alice's value for the product. This means there's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to close the deal at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $145 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $135 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to your budget, it's still above Alice's perceived value for the product. This suggests there is still room for negotiation to get a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $138.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 138}
