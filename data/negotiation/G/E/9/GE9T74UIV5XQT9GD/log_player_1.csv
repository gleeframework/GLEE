Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $1,000,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can work together to make this happen.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer:

Explanation:

While Bob increased his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to your minimum.  His ""final offer"" language suggests further negotiation is unlikely to yield a substantial increase. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price, avoiding further risk of a lower offer or a failed negotiation."
