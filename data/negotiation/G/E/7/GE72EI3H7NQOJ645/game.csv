"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $850,000. This is my best offer, what do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This is a generous offer considering its potential.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, let me know if you're open to it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
