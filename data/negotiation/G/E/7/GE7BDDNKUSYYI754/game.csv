"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll love it.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a fair offer considering the product's value.",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9000. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $8750. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",8750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8750. I'm willing to pay $8200, but that's as high as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",8200.0,Bob,6,
