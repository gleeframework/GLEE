"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $9,000? That's a fair compromise, and still a good deal for you considering the value to me. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm still hoping to find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,800 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,200. This is a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",9200.0,Alice,5,
