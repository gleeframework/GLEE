Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've started with a price of $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" for Bob, aiming to make him feel like he's getting a good price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly signals that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer if needed.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. By offering a price higher than his perceived value, I'm creating some pressure for him to accept. However, by being open to negotiation, I'm leaving room for him to make a counteroffer if he finds the price too high. This will allow me to gauge his interest and adjust my approach accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. By rejecting, I can send a counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'll need to be strategic in my counteroffer to avoid pushing Bob away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is lower than I'm able to accept right now, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $10,500? This price still gives you a great deal considering the product's value, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to increase his perceived worth and make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Positive Language:** The message uses positive language like ""great deal"" and ""closer to what I need,"" making the counteroffer more appealing and less confrontational.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still protecting my minimum acceptable price.  By meeting Bob halfway, I'm showing flexibility and demonstrating a desire to reach a deal.  This approach could potentially lead to a successful negotiation without pushing Bob to completely walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10,000, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still not enough. I value the product at $15,000, and I'm not willing to compromise any further.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000. This decision is based on the following factors:

* **Meeting Minimum:** I'm guaranteed to get my minimum acceptable price from John.
* **Time Efficiency:** Selling to John avoids further negotiation with Bob, saving time and effort.
* **Certainty:**  John's offer is guaranteed, while Bob's final offer is still uncertain.

By selling to John, I'm maximizing my profit and ensuring that I get the fair value for my product."
