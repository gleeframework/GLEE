Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives me room to negotiate and maximizes my potential profit.
* **Friendly approach:**  Using a friendly and engaging tone can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm clearly stating that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. This shows flexibility and could lead to a faster agreement. 

**Next steps:**

I'll be monitoring Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own. I'll also need to be mindful of my time and consider selling to John if the negotiation with Bob is dragging on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $105 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my target price.  Since Bob is interested, there's potential for further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** While selling to John for $120 is a safe option, I'd rather try to get a better price if possible.

**Next step:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you being interested in the product. I understand your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm increasing my offer from $115 to $110, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Splitting the difference:** Offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer is a common negotiation tactic that suggests a fair compromise.
* **Highlighting fairness:** Using phrases like ""fair price for both of us"" emphasizes that I'm seeking a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**

I'll monitor Bob's response. If he accepts, I've secured a decent price. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to counter again or to sell to John, keeping in mind my minimum price and the time spent negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, which would be $107.50. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $107.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Time is a factor:** We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John for $120 ensures that I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiations. 

**Conclusion:**

Although I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob. Selling to John guarantees a profitable deal and saves me time."
