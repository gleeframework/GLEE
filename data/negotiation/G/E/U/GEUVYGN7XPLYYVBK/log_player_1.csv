Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **High Starting Point:**  $19,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but allows room for negotiation if Bob shows interest. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims to project value and entice Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You have a good buffer to work with, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $15,000.
* **Bob's Perspective:**  Keep in mind that Bob might not see the value at your initial price.  Observe his reaction and be ready to adjust your approach if needed."
