Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum, but it allows for room to negotiate downwards if Bob is interested.  I'm hoping to gauge his level of interest and get a sense of what he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my desired price. I believe there's potential to get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale. I believe this price point is a reasonable middle ground and might encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  Bob has continued to lower his offers, and I'm starting to feel that we may be far apart in our valuations.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  John's offer guarantees me my minimum and avoids further negotiation with Bob that might drag on and result in a lower sale price."
