"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. There's no immediate reason to accept. It's worth exploring if you can get a lower price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  I'm genuinely interested in the product and believe this price is fair given its value."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $13500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $15,000 to $13,500. This is a good compromise and within my budget. Accepting this offer allows me to buy the product and save $1,500 compared to John's price. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and ending up paying John's full price is too high."
