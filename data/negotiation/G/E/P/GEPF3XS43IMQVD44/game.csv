"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1200000. This reflects the product's significant value and potential.  I'm open to discussing a fair price that benefits us both. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not sure the product is worth that much to me. I'm willing to make an offer of $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential.  I'm willing to compromise, but $1050000 is the lowest I can go.  This price is still a good deal for you, considering the benefits you'll gain. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has some unique qualities, but I still think $900000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
