"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its potential value. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I've analyzed its market value thoroughly, and I'm confident it's worth much more.  How about we meet halfway at $1,400,000? This reflects its value while still offering you a substantial return on investment.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your reasoning, but $1,400,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which reflects a significant investment on my part.  Let's find a middle ground to make this deal work for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,000,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value while staying within my budget. Let's seal the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
