Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit beyond the minimum I'm willing to accept. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'll keep an eye on how much he's willing to pay, and if he seems too low, I'll be ready to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price, and even lower than John's guaranteed offer.  I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show willingness to negotiate, but still keeping it well above Bob's initial offer and my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price while also leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not sure if he'll go any higher.  Given that John is offering the same amount, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better price, I'll take John's offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
