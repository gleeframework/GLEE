"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $13000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only do $11500 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $11,500 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000 just yet. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $11,500 is a good offer, I'm still looking to get closer to $12,000. Would you consider $11,800? This would allow me to make this deal work and still get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 11800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11800 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  How about $11600?  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and lets me get the product within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $11,600 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I think I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and meet at $11,700? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11700}
