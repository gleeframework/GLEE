"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. I believe it's a great value for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a better price.  Since you have a backup option with John, there's no harm in rejecting Alice's initial offer and seeing if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $13,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only do $11,500 right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $11500 is a good offer, I'm still looking to get closer to $12000. Would you consider $11800? This would allow me to make this deal work and still get a fair price for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but you can still push for a better deal.  Since you have the option to buy from John, there's no reason to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,800 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  How about $11,600?  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and lets me get the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 11600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and meet at $11700? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is offering a price that's only slightly higher than your initial counteroffer, and it's closer to your maximum budget than John's price.  Accepting the offer is the best option to save money and close the deal."
