"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your offer. $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $600,000. It's a significant investment for me, and that price aligns better with my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $700,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair value considering the product's worth to you.",725000.0,Alice,5,
