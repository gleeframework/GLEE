"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product is valuable to me, $750,000 is still a bit steep. I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
