"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $8,500 is a bit too low for me, considering its value. I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,250 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to go down to $8,750, which is a fair price considering its value to you. This is my final offer.",8750.0,Alice,5,
