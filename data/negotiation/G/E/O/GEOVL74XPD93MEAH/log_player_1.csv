"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000. Can we work together to find a mutually beneficial price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $875,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles here. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer $887,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $882,500. Can we find a way to make this work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, we've been going back and forth for several rounds, and it's likely we're nearing the end of the negotiation. $882,500 is still a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by pushing for more."
