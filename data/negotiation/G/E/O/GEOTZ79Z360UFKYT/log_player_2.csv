Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value of this product. What do you think?

Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'll make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $925,000, but I'll throw in some additional features that will increase the product's value to you. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stuck at $925,000 and doesn't seem likely to budge. While the added features might be nice, they don't change the fact that John offers the same product for $1,000,000.  At this point, cutting your losses and going with John ensures you don't overpay."
