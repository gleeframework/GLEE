"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
