"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its value and the market price. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.",9500.0,Bob,4,
