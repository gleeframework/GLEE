Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:** You're making a profit of $2,000.
* **Lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can counter, potentially reaching a higher price.

However, you also have the option of selling to John for $8,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out. This provides you with a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is better than John's offer of $8,000, it's still lower than your initial offer of $10,000. This leaves room for further negotiation to potentially get a better price.  You want to maximize your profit, so you should reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to try and get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,500.  This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This counteroffer does the following:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to move from your initial offer, demonstrating that you're open to negotiation.
* **Keeps the deal attractive to Bob:** $9,500 is still a good price for Bob, given his perceived value of $12,000.
* **Positions you for a potential win:**  This price leaves room for further negotiation if Bob rejects, but it's higher than John's offer, ensuring you don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I can do $9250 if you're willing to compromise further. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,250 is a good deal for you. It's higher than John's offer of $8,000, and it's close to your desired price point. While further negotiation could potentially get you a higher price, it's not guaranteed. It's better to take the sure deal and secure a profit of $1,250."
