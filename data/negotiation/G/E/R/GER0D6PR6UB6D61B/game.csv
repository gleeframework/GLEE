,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,400,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
