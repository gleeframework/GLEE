Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you make a significant profit if Bob accepts. This price also gives Bob a small incentive to buy from you rather than seeking out a potentially better deal elsewhere (which he doesn't know exists in this scenario).

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might try to negotiate the price down. Be prepared to adjust your offer slightly, but don't go below your $100 minimum. You always have John as a guaranteed backup buyer."
