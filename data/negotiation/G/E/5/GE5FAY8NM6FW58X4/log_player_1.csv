Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for the best possible price.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm hoping to push him towards a counteroffer where we can find a mutually beneficial price.  If he rejects, I'll reassess based on his counteroffer and my need to sell quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1 million.  I will counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than his initial counteroffer.  I hope this encourages him to come closer to my desired price without risking him walking away entirely."
