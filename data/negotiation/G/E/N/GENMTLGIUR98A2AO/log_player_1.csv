Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $19,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  By emphasizing the product's ""significant value"" you might persuade Bob to consider a price closer to your asking amount, even though it's above his perceived value. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you don't mind potentially losing Bob as a buyer if he finds the initial price too high. You're leveraging the security of your backup offer from John."
