Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

We're still far from my minimum and Bob's offer is significantly below his perceived value. There's room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm certainly willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Would you consider $1,200,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,100,000 is getting closer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. Bob is clearly interested and values the product highly."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you finding a middle ground.  To be honest, I'm a little hesitant to go below $1,150,000. This product has tremendous potential, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return on your investment.  What do you say?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for explaining your position. I understand the value, but I also have a budget to work with.  Would you be willing to close the deal at $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to find a fair price and is steadily increasing his offer.  $1,125,000 is a strong offer, and while I might be able to squeeze out a bit more in further rounds, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.  It's a good profit above my minimum."
