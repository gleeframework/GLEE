Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1250000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation and still leaves Bob with a profit margin.  This strategy aims to find a price that balances maximizing your profit with ensuring a deal is reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves you with less profit. Rejecting his offer allows you to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for negotiation and ensuring a decent profit for you."
