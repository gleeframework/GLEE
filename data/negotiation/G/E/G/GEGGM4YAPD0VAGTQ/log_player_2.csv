"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal compared to the product's value to Alice, it's still over your desired price point. Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my target but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Motivation:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to buy, but I'm setting a clear limit to get Alice to consider a lower price. 
* **Reasonable offer:**  $10,500 is a reasonable starting point, and it's likely to be acceptable to Alice, considering her desire to sell and the fact that she values the product at $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my target price of $10,000. While $11,000 is closer to my limit, I'm not ready to accept yet. I'll counteroffer again and see if I can get closer to my goal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,750? It's a fair compromise and gets us both closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise, showing that I'm willing to meet halfway.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this offer is fair to both of us.
* **Urgency:**  I'm subtly increasing the pressure by mentioning getting ""closer to a deal,"" suggesting that I'm ready to finalize the transaction."
