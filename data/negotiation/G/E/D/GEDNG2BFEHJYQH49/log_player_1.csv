Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Negotiation Margin:**  This offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a substantial profit above your minimum. 

**Important:**  This is just the opening move. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
