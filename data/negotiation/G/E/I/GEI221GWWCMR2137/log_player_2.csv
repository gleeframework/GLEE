"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $11,500.** This is a good deal, but Bob can potentially save more money by counteroffering. 
* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.**  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still leaves you a good margin of value. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob.**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so paying $11,000 saves him $1,000.
* **Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it's also risky.**  There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and Bob could end up paying more to John if he doesn't reach an agreement with Alice.
* **The potential savings of $500 by continuing to negotiate are not worth the risk of losing the deal with Alice.**"
