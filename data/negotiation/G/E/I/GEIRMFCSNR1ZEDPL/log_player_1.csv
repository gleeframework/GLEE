Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum goal of $120 while still making the deal appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $115 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'd be happy to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great price for this product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
