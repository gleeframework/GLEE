"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I believe the product has potential, but the price point is a little high for me at the moment.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $950,000?  This offer represents a fair compromise, I believe.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
