Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

This is a good price point to accept. Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and getting the product for $450,000 less than John's offer is a significant saving."
