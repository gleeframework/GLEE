Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150. It's a great deal for something of this quality, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob.  
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $150 leaves room for negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, bringing the price closer to his maximum valuation.  
* **Confidence:**  Expressing confidence in the product's value can make Bob more inclined to accept a higher price. 

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects the $150 offer, you haven't lost anything. You'll still sell the product to John for your minimum acceptable price."
