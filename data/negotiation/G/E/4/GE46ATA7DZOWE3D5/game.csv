,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a middle ground.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $105 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  How about we settle on $100?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but $100 is still a bit below my minimum. How about we meet at $108?",108.0,Alice,5,
