"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can get the product for less from Alice, so it's worth trying to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

You can still get the product for cheaper than $105, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $105 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  How about we settle on $100?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but $100 is still a bit below my minimum. How about we meet at $108? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You're very close to the price you were hoping to get, and it's unlikely you'll get a lower offer from Alice. It's better to accept the offer before the price goes up again or you're forced to buy from John."
