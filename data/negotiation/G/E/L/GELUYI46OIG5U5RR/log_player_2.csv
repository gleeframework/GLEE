"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. Alice is offering it at $1,000,000, which is your maximum.  However, you have a fallback option of buying from John for the same price.  This means you can reject Alice's offer and still get the product at the same price."
