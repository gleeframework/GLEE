"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. After careful consideration, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $900,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a discounted rate. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you require further information. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than both your maximum budget ($1,000,000) and Alice's stated value for the product ($1,500,000).  This suggests it's a very good deal. While there might be a slight chance of getting the product for even less, the risk of losing this offer and potentially having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000 is too high."
