"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. You still have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This establishes a clear starting point for negotiation and hopefully prompts Alice to consider a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I want to see if I can negotiate further and potentially get closer to my target price of $1,000,000.  There's still room for Alice to come down in price, and I want to see if she's willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product and willing to pay a fair price, but still keeps the negotiation moving towards my target price of $1,000,000.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While I could continue negotiating,  there's no guarantee we'll reach a mutually acceptable price. It's  more efficient to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation."
