"I understand that $1100000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1150000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're serious about the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1100000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not comfortable going below that price, as it's still below my minimum value for the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1050000. Can you consider my offer?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
