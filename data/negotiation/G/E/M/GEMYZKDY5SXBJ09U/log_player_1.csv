Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $10,000 is less than Bob's value of $12,000, giving him an incentive to buy. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can always lower the price slightly, but still earn more than your minimum.

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is above the price John is offering, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $9,000? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my value for the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a compromise: 

* It's higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer.
* It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* It's still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and meets my minimum requirements."
