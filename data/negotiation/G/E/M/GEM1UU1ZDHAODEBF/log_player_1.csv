Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of the product to me.

However, I also need to consider that selling the product to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed option, and it's worth considering. I'll think carefully about it before making my next move.
