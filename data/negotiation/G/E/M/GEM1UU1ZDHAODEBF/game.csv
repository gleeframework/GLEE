"I'd like to offer you the product for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of the product to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your need to sell it quickly.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1,075,000, which is a compromise between my minimum price and your offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my need to sell it quickly.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
