"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something we can work with?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $1200000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1800000. This is the highest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1800000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1600000, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider this price?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're still trying to negotiate, but I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1650000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1650000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I've already made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $1650000, and you're still offering $1600000. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle.
