"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,600,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway to show my commitment to making this deal work. How about we settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me. I'm serious about buying this product, but it needs to be at a price that works for both of us. How about $700,000? This shows I'm willing to move, but I need you to meet me closer to my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious, and I'm ready to find a solution. Let's bridge this gap â€“ how about $950,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the value this product brings to the table.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting closer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair to both of us, I can go up to $750,000.  That's a big jump from my last offer, and it shows how serious I am about closing this deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 as my final offer.  This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal with you.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the compromise you've made. However, I've carefully considered my budget, and to be frank, $900,000 is just beyond what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to make one final offer of $775,000.  This represents a significant stretch for me, but I believe it's a fair offer that allows both of us to benefit. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options, but I hope we can close this deal.",775000.0,Bob,8,
