"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 simply isn't viable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1700000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high. My maximum offer remains $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget constraints.  I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
