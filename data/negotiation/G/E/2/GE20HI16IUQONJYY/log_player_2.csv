Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a slight improvement from the first offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. He should try to negotiate further."

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  It's the same price as her first offer, but since he's already rejected her offer once and made a counteroffer, it's likely she won't go lower.  Buying from Alice at $13,500 is still a better deal than buying from John at $15,000."
