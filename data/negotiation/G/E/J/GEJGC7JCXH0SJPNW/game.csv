"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1100000 is still too high for me.  I'm really only able to go up to $900000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can see the value in the product and meet me in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
