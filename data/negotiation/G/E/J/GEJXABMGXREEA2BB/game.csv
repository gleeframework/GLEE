"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,750. Can you meet me at that price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,900 is my final offer. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,700. Can you meet me at that price?",8700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,700 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  $8,800 is my absolute bottom line.  If we can agree on this, we can close the deal.  If not, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",8800.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,800 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",8600.0,Bob,8,
