Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can find a price closer to what you're asking for. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $1,050,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I still have 8 rounds left and John is willing to pay $1,000,000 so I'm not at risk of losing too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
