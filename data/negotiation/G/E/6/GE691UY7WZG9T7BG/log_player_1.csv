"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range. This allows for some negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```
 
I'm offering a price that's still above Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value. This shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'll keep negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $100. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering a price that is exactly at Bob's perceived value. This is a good compromise that may entice him to accept, especially since it's higher than his last offer."
