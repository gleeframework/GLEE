"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are looking to pay no more than $120 and Alice's offer is $90. While this is within your budget, it's still possible to get a better deal.  You can try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm hoping to get a slightly better price.  Would you consider $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $92? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to increase the price, but it's still within your budget.  However, you can likely negotiate a lower price than $92. Since John is offering the product for $120, you still have room to counter Alice's offer without taking the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $92 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $88? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can agree on it. "", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to making a decision, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $91? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $91
* **Your Maximum:** $120
* **John's Offer:** $120

Alice has lowered her price again, and while you might be able to push for a slightly lower price,  $91 is still within your budget and a good deal compared to John's price. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. It's a good compromise and likely the best offer you'll get."
