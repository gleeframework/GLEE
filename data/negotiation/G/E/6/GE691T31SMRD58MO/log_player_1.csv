Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  I believe this price fairly reflects its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $700,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing me to make the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $825,000?"", ""product_price"": 825000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet at $825,000. Would it be possible to reconsider the price to something closer to $750,000? This would allow me to make the purchase without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's clear he's highly unlikely to reach your $800,000 baseline. Continuing the negotiation has a decreasing chance of success and risks leaving you with a worse outcome. It's strategically sound to accept John's offer now."
