"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  I believe this price fairly reflects its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $700,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing me to make the purchase.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet at $825,000. Would it be possible to reconsider the price to something closer to $750,000? This would allow me to make the purchase without exceeding my financial limits.",750000.0,Bob,4,
