Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth at least $120. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also explaining my reasoning for the price to make it seem more fair.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I believe I can't pay more than $100 for it. Would you consider accepting this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $100, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to sell it for $100.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $110? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it, but I still believe $100 is the most I can afford. Could we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my $120 goal, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and we're already at a price that's above what I'd get from John. Accepting Bob's offer of $105 is the best option here."
