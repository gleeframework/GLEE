"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm thinking of a price of $15000 for this product. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. What are your thoughts?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $13500? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I don't think $13500 is a good compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $10000. How about we discuss a price of $11500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about the value I'm getting from the sale. How about we discuss a price of $14000? I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit far apart, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,6,
