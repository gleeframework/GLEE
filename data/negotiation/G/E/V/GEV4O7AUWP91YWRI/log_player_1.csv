"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but if he's not, I'm prepared to counter or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  It's less than half of my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,000,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's closer than before, I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,200,000 at this point. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to try one more time to see if I can get Bob closer to my minimum value. I'm dropping my counteroffer to $900,000. This is still above my floor, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate further.  If he rejects this, I'm going to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offers are still significantly lower than my minimum value, and I'm not confident I can get him to increase his offer enough to be worth the risk of further negotiation.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a sure thing with John."
