Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit. If Bob rejects, we can see where his counteroffer lands and adjust accordingly. I'll keep John's offer of $120 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. While I'm not going to immediately sell to John, I need to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $130. This is a compromise, moving halfway towards Bob's offer, but still ensuring I make a decent profit. Hopefully, this shows my willingness to negotiate while also setting a reasonable price."
