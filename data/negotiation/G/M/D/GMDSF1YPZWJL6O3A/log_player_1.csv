"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. Could you do $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer.  However, I'm still not quite there. How about $7,000?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're getting closer!  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,500?"", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're really close.  I'm willing to go up a bit to $7,200, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has indicated $7,200 is his final offer.  While it's tempting to try and squeeze a bit more, we risk losing the sale entirely.  John offers a guaranteed $8,000, which is a better outcome than potentially settling for less with Bob."
