"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay something closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the value of this product is significantly higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,900,000. This feels like a fair offer considering its potential return on investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. I appreciate you coming down, but I need to see a more significant move to consider this seriously. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. However, the $700,000 offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to drop to $1,700,000, but that's my final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, that last offer is still too high for me to consider.  I'm willing to pay $750,000, but that's the absolute most I can do. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
