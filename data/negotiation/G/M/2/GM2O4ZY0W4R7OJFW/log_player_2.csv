"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no incentive to negotiate with her since you're already guaranteed the same price from John. Buying from John ensures you don't risk any time or effort in negotiation that might lead to no deal."
