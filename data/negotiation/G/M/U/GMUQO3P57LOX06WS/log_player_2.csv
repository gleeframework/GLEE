"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can do better than $110.  You want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

$100 is a good price, saving you $20 compared to buying from John.  It's also a good deal for Alice, as she's still making a profit.  Accepting the offer is the best option here."
