Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer aims to maximize my profit while still leaving some room for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal. Here's why:

* **My minimum:**  I'm willing to sell to John for $1,000,000, so any price higher than that is a win for me.
* **Bob's value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so he has a $500,000 ""cushion"" to negotiate.
* **The offer:**  $1,400,000 is a significant amount of money, but it leaves Bob with $100,000 in potential savings. 

By offering this price, I'm hoping to strike a balance between securing a good profit and encouraging Bob to accept the deal."
