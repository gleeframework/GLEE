"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  My price is $130.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $110.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to come up. $95 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close this deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
