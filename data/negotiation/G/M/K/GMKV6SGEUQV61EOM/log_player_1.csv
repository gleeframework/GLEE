"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downward.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A $9,500 price point still leaves some room for a compromise without making me feel like I'm selling myself short too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I want to make a deal, $8,500 is below my floor of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I have 10 rounds, so I can continue to negotiate with Bob, potentially reaching a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed $10,000 sale with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a significant discount from my initial asking price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial $9,500 offer, but I'm still holding out for a price above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the Discount:**  Mentioning the ""significant discount"" from my initial price emphasizes the value Bob could be getting. 
* **Keeping the Door Open:** I'm phrasing the message as a question to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is moving closer, his offer of $8,750 is still below my minimum of $10,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I believe there's a chance of getting a better price within the remaining rounds.
* **John is an Option:** I'm not desperate, as I have John as a backup buyer who will pay my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair price that takes both our needs into account.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Sort of):** I'm offering to meet halfway between my previous offer ($9,000) and Bob's offer ($8,750), signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with ""Let's find a way to make this work"" encourages further negotiation and maintains a positive tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets My Minimum:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is finally within my minimum acceptable range of $10,000.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he'll walk away, leaving me with only John, who will pay my minimum.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I need to start closing the deal. 

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price,  accepting Bob's offer ensures I make a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
