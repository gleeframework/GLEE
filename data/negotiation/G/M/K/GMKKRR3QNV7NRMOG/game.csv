"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested but $12,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to make this work. This is a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? This is a fair price that works for both of us and gets this deal done.",13000.0,Bob,4,
