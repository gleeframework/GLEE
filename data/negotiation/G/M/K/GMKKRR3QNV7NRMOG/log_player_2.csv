"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal range. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to meet Alice's minimum price ($12,000) while still securing a good deal for himself. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation but demonstrates Bob's seriousness in buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested but $12,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to make this work. This is a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $12,500. While Alice's offer is better than her first one, it's still a bit high.  By rejecting and counteroffering, Bob can see if he can squeeze out a better deal before considering the $15,000 option from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? This is a fair price that works for both of us and gets this deal done."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a middle ground between his last offer and Alice's. He's demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a better price. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward without being overly aggressive."
