"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice will lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range where he's willing to buy the product. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating and sets the stage for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $11,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, it's still worth exploring if he can get closer to his desired price point. It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by proposing a compromise. He's met Alice halfway in terms of their last offers, showing he's serious about finding a solution. This counteroffer could be tempting for Alice as it's closer to her desired price point while still being a good deal for Bob."
