"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $120, and Alice's offer is $100.  You can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get the price down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still within your budget, and you're saving $10 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject your counteroffer, and you'd end up paying the full $120 to John. It's more advantageous to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
