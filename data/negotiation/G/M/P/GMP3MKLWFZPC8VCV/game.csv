,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little.  Let's split the difference.  I'm happy to sell it to you for $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $8500 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9250? This way, we both make a compromise and can finalize this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
