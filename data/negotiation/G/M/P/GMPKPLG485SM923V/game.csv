"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's try to find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, and I'm willing to move up a little. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,500 is closer, but it's still a little low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal happen.  Let's close this now.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving down on the price. To be honest, $11,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you can make that work, I'm ready to finalize the deal today.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment and willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,500, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  It's a significant jump for me, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's close this deal now and avoid further delays.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've been really hoping we could make this work.  However, I have another offer I need to consider if we can't agree on $11,000. I'm willing to finalize the deal right now for $11,000, but that's as high as I can go.",11000.0,Bob,8,
