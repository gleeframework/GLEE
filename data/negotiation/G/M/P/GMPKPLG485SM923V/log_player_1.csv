"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($15,000) and above what I know the product is worth to Bob ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to work with Bob, which is key in building rapport and encouraging him to make a counteroffer. 
* **Leaving Room for John:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always go to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a price closer to $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation room:** I still have 9 rounds to negotiate a better price. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  I can try to meet in the middle with Bob, or potentially even get closer to my desired price. 
* **John as a safety net:** I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if I don't reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Fair Value:**  $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he's willing to pay $10,000.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By not accepting his low offer and counter-offering, I'm maintaining my leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Staying above my floor:** I'm still above my minimum price of $15,000, but I'm moving closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, and I'm willing to move up a little. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is a significant improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for improvement:** I still have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price. 
* **Potential for better deal:** By continuing to negotiate, I might be able to get closer to my desired price or even meet Bob at $12,000, which would be a more favorable deal for me. 
* **John as backup:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,500 is closer, but it's still a little low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal happen.  Let's close this now."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not accepting his offer yet, but I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to his price. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** I'm proposing $12,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($13,000) and his offer ($10,500). This shows a genuine desire to reach a compromise.
* **Pressure to Close:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by saying ""Let's close this now."" This might motivate Bob to accept.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm still above my minimum price and still have John as a backup option if negotiations fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving down on the price. To be honest, $11,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you can make that work, I'm ready to finalize the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  I only have 4 rounds left, and I want to maximize my profit. 
* **Possibility of a Better Deal:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price by holding out and potentially getting closer to my desired price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which is a guaranteed profit.

**Strategy:**  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a price closer to $12,000 in the next round. I'll consider selling to John if I don't see a significant improvement in Bob's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment and willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,500, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  It's a significant jump for me, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's close this deal now and avoid further delays."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising and Reaching Middle Ground:**  I'm offering $11,500, which is exactly halfway between Bob's offer of $11,000 and my previous offer of $12,000.  This shows a strong willingness to compromise and get the deal done.
* **Highlighting the Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to further justify my offer. This helps to remind Bob that $11,500 is still a good deal for him.
* **Adding Urgency:**  The ""Let's close this deal now and avoid further delays"" statement adds a sense of urgency and might push Bob to accept the offer.
* **Staying Above the Minimum:**  While $11,500 is below my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and I'm willing to take this deal as we are running out of rounds.
* **John as Backup:**  I still have John as a backup option, which gives me a safety net if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've been really hoping we could make this work.  However, I have another offer I need to consider if we can't agree on $11,000. I'm willing to finalize the deal right now for $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  I only have two rounds left.  
* **No Significant Improvement Expected:** Bob is firm on $11,000, and I don't believe he will budge further.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** While $11,000 is lower than my ideal price, it's still a profitable deal for me and ensures I don't lose out entirely. 
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  If I reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further, there's a chance Bob will walk away, leaving me with no deal. Selling to John would be my only option, but I'd get a lower price ($15,000) than what I can get from Bob now.

**Strategy:**  It's better to accept Bob's offer, secure a guaranteed profit, and avoid the risk of losing out on any deal."
