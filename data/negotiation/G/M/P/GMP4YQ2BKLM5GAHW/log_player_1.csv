Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm asking for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its significant worth.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and presents the offer as a potential win-win for both parties. 
 
Let's see if Bob bites!"
