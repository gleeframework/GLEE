"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still looking for a bit more. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This gives you a significant discount while ensuring I get a fair price. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $950,000 is tempting, I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable asset. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This is a great deal for both of us. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $980,000 is a good offer, but I need just a bit more to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it's a great deal considering the value of this product to you. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
