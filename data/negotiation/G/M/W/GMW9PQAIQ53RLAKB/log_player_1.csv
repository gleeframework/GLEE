""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits it holds for you.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. While it's above his valuation, it's still within a reasonable negotiation range from your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" subtly emphasizes the product's worth, potentially shifting Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""initially offering"" and ""Let me know what you think"" signal your willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to open a negotiation where you can potentially secure a price significantly higher than Bob's initial valuation, while still leaving room to go down if needed. Your guaranteed sale to John at $1,500,000 acts as a strong safety net, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
