"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $13,000.  This is a bold move, but it allows for more negotiation room if Bob counters.  I'm confident that the product's value to me is high enough that I can afford to start high and potentially come down a bit.  I also want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $9,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I could accept and walk away with some profit, I'd rather try to get closer to my target.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm countering with $11,500. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  It's still above Bob's offer, but closer to his range.  This gives Bob room to counter again if he's serious about purchasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a slight improvement from his last offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I believe there's still potential to reach a deal closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm countering again with $11,000.  This shows continued willingness to compromise, but I'm staying firm on my position that the product is worth more than $10,000 to me. I'm hoping that Bob sees the value and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I'm determined to reach a deal that is more profitable for me.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round and see if we can finally bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm dropping my price to $10,500, which is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price.  This shows that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob, but I'm also firm on the value of the product. I hope that Bob is willing to accept this offer. If he doesn't, I will sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price, and we only have two rounds left.  I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $12,000 by continuing to negotiate.  John is a reliable buyer, and I'm confident I can close the deal with him."
