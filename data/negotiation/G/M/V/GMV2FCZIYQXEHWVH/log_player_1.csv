Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, I can still potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm offering $110 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not giving in too much. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $108. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my desired price of $120 and it's a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away or me losing time and selling to John at the lower price."
