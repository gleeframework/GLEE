"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $250?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $175? I think it's a fair price that works for both of us.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135. This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finalise the transaction. ",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $135 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $175, so how about we discuss a price of $155? I think it's a fair price that works for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
