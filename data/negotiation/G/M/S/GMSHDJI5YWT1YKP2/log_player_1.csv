Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's above your minimum but still leaves room for Bob to counteroffer. It also positions the offer as a good deal for him, which may lead to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is above your minimum, it's still lower than your initial offer and you can likely get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit more. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Could we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 is still slightly less than my ideal price, it's a good compromise and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for $80. It's also a fair price for both of us, as Bob clearly isn't willing to go much higher."
