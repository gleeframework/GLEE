"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested,  $13,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $11,000. This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
