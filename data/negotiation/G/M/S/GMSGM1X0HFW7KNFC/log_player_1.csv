"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, so I will reject it. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a compromise from my initial offer.  I hope this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but it's getting closer. I'm not desperate to sell, so I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum value and shows I'm willing to negotiate. I believe this is a fair price, and I hope Bob will accept it."
