Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to get as much as possible. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference at $8,250?  That's still a great price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $8250 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting further away from my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $8,000, which is a good price and meets my minimum.  Negotiating further with Bob risks losing both him and John as potential buyers."
