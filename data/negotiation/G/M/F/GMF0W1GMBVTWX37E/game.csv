"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that 150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for 110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $110. How about $95? It's a fair compromise and closer to what I can afford.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob, but I think 95 is still a bit low. I can offer it to you for 105, which is a compromise between our previous offers.",105.0,Alice,5,
