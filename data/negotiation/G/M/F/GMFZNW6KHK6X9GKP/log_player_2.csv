"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best price possible. Starting with a lower counteroffer of $950,000 is a good strategy. It demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while still being a fair price. Alice has a strong incentive to accept this offer as it is still more than what she would get from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but Bob can still likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer again and potentially reach a lower price. It's still worthwhile to continue the negotiation, as John's offer is only $50,000 better than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been negotiating and has gotten Alice to come down from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000. This counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a fair compromise. It is still a good deal for Bob, and it is close enough to John's offer that Alice may be motivated to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,025,000, which is only $25,000 more than John's offer.  It is worth accepting Alice's offer as the difference is minor. There is a risk of continuing to negotiate, but it is not worth the chance of Alice walking away or raising her price again."
