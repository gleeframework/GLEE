"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $900000. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and your needs.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my original price. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
