Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135. I think it's a steal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $135 gives some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. He might be willing to pay slightly more than his perceived value. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120, your minimum acceptable price."
