"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell, $1,250,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table. Let's meet closer to the middle ground â€“ how about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Considering your initial offer was $2,000,000 and my previous offer was $1,250,000, I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
