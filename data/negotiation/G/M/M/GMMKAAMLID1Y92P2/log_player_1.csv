Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's a great deal at $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price might result in a quicker sale and still yield a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $110 is a price point that allows me to make a $30 profit ($110 - $80), while still being significantly more attractive to Bob than his perceived value of $80.
* **First Refusal Tactic:** By framing the offer as a ""first refusal,"" I'm subtly implying that the product is desirable and others might want it, potentially nudging Bob to act quickly."
