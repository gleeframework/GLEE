"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you a solid profit and me a valuable product at a price I can afford.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $950,000 is a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need a bit more. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
