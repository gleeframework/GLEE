Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you a solid profit and me a valuable product at a price I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial deal.
