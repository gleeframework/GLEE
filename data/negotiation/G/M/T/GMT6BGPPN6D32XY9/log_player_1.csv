Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, as I don't know how much he values it.  If he rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but I want to see how he reacts first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more for the product. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, and I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm offering $17,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $16,000 is a good deal considering the back and forth. It's more than what John is offering, and I'm not sure how much further I can push Bob. It's time to close the deal."
