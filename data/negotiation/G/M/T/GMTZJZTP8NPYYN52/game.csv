"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for it. However, I'm looking for a more reasonable price. Could we perhaps agree on something closer to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $12000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to you and my budget, could we possibly settle on $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is getting close to the minimum value I was willing to accept, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12500.0,Alice,5,
