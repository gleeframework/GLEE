"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $95 for your product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob, but I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still below what I could get elsewhere. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
