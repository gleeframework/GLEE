Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum price of $10,000. I'm hoping to get closer to that by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500.  This is a compromise, halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to get close to my minimum price while still being appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Even though Bob is willing to pay $9,000, that's still below my minimum of $10,000. John is offering my minimum, so it's the best option for me to maximize my profit."
