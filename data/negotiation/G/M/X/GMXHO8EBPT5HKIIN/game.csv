"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering its inherent value. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is above my budget.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle - would you be willing to go up to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Would you consider $975,000? I believe this reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $975,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to go with John's offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
