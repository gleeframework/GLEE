**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum price of $1,200,000.  His latest offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John at my desired price, it makes the most financial sense to sell the product to him.  Continuing negotiations with Bob has a lower potential payoff with the risk of him walking away entirely."
