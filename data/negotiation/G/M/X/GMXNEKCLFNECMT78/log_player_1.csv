{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Let's keep negotiating. We're still significantly below Bob's perceived value and there's room to push for a better price.  Selling to John is a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000?"",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,110,000, which would be $1,092,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,092,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,092,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and move towards a price point favorable to us. Accepting $1,092,500 is tempting, but we can likely push for a bit more before considering John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,092,500 is cutting it a little too close. How about we settle at $1,100,000 even? It's a strong offer, and I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short of my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to go up to $1,095,000, but no more. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,095,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

It's time to accept. Bob is unlikely to go above $1,095,000, and we're already in a good negotiating position. Accepting this offer secures a strong profit above our minimum."
