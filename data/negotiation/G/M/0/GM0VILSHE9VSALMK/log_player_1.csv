"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth, and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not unreasonably so):**  I'm aiming high to establish a strong initial position. While Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he may be willing to pay a premium for something he considers truly valuable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A high starting price gives me room to negotiate down during the 10 rounds. 
* **Confident and Open Tone:** My message aims to be confident without being aggressive. I want Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000 gives me a strong bargaining position. I'm not desperate to close a deal below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $1,800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his initial valuation. This indicates there's room for negotiation, and I'm likely to secure a better deal by countering. While selling to John is an option, I want to explore maximizing my profit with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value of this product goes beyond a standard price tag.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $2,100,000? I believe that's a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm coming down from my initial offer, but not drastically.  A $200,000 decrease shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a high price.
* **Highlighting Value (Again):** I'm reiterating the product's unique value to justify the higher price point, subtly pushing back against Bob's budget-focused approach. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** Framing the counteroffer as a compromise encourages Bob to reciprocate with a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given this some thought, Alice. While I recognize the product's value, I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Would $1,900,000 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. While $1,900,000 is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds.  I'm willing to take a calculated risk to see if I can push closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind.  How about we meet halfway and close the deal at $2,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Finality:** By suggesting a $2,000,000 price, I'm offering a concession while making it clear this is a desirable outcome. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  We're past the halfway point in the rounds, and suggesting we ""close the deal"" adds a subtle time pressure.
* **Strong Position:**  I'm confident in this offer. It represents a significant profit margin, and I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John for my minimum if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I'm willing to go up to $1,950,000. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly committed to purchasing the product and is steadily increasing his offer. Accepting his offer of $1,950,000 makes sense now for these reasons: 

* **Strong Profit:**  It's significantly higher than my minimum of $1,500,000 and a $450,000 profit is a great outcome.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more in the remaining rounds, there's also a risk Bob could lower his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a very good deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the capital available sooner for other investments or opportunities."
