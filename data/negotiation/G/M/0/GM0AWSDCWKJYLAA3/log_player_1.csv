"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging. I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob while subtly implying that he might miss out on a good deal if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with some more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That way we both get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $100, which is halfway between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of my own interests. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and focused on finding a mutually beneficial solution. I'm reiterating my belief that a deal at $100 would be fair for both of us."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $95 is still below my minimum value of $120. I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. It's a risk, but I think I can push for a better deal with more negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to go down to $98.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 98} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $98, which is a small compromise from my previous offer of $100. I'm trying to signal that I'm flexible but still want a price that's close to my desired value.
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating my understanding of Bob's budget constraints, but I'm also emphasizing the fairness of my offer and the opportunity to close the deal. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your offer, but I still need to make some adjustments to fit my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer, $92 is still significantly below my minimum value of $120. I'm not willing to sell for that price, and I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more agreeable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a better deal in the next round. With only a few rounds remaining, I need to be strategic and see if I can secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $92 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close the deal. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my previous offer of $98 and Bob's offer of $92. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum value.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the progress we've made in the negotiation and highlighting the benefits of reaching a deal at this price point. I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to try and motivate Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly below my minimum desired value of $120.  I've already been very flexible in my negotiations, and I'm not convinced I can get a better price with only one more round.  Rather than risk getting stuck with a low price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  It's the best option to ensure I get the value I'm looking for."
