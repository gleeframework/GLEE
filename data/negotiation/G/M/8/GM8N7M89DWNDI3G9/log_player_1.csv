Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while staying above my minimum.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $150 gives me leverage. I don't need to desperately lowball the price."
