"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to me is worth no more than $1500000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1350000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits the product will bring to my company. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1350000 is still below the value I need to make this worthwhile for me.  Considering the unique benefits this product offers and its potential to greatly enhance your company's performance, I'm willing to come down to $1400000.  This price is still competitive and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a middle ground to make this happen.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and your latest offer is closer to what I'm aiming for.  However, $1375000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1390000. This price is still a fair reflection of the product's value and will allow us to both benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground on this last offer.",1390000.0,Alice,5,
