Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?,120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $87.50?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the way you think! Splitting the difference again is a great idea. However, I was thinking maybe we could meet in the middle of $95 and $87.50, which would be $91.25. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",91.25,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're a tough negotiator!  I'm willing to go up a little bit to $89, but that's as high as I can go.",89.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $90. It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make a deal!",90.0,Alice,7,
