Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $20,000, but to start negotiations, I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $19,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $16,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $16,000 is still a significant step away from what I need to make this work.  Would you consider $17,000? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,800 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push Bob further, his final offer of $15,800 is reasonably close to my minimum and significantly better than John's offer.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing the sale altogether."
