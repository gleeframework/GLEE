"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I also need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is my best price for now.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $760,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $810,000. This is my bottom line, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to work with you, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too.",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for clarifying. I understand where you're coming from.  How about we split the difference and settle at $785,000?  That way we both feel like we're getting a reasonable deal.",785000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about we meet at $795,000? This is a bit higher than your offer, but it's still a compromise that I'm comfortable with.",795000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle this right now at $790,000?  It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid any further back and forth.",790000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $790,000. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we meet at $795,500? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",795500.0,Alice,9,
