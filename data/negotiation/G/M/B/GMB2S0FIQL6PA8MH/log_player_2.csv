"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I would get from another buyer.  Let me know if you're interested, but please be quick as I have other offers on the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than her initial value, it's still higher than what you can get from John. You should reject her offer and buy from John for $1,000,000 to save $100,000."
