Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Above Bob's Value:**  While $90 is less than your minimum, it's still more than what Bob values the product at. However, the ""special price"" message might entice him. 
* **Close to John's Offer:** If Bob rejects this offer, you're not losing much since John is willing to pay $100. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product."
