"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer. You are looking for a product worth no more than $800,000 to you. Alice's offer is too high.  It's better to counteroffer or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my initial price point. How about we meet in the middle at $925000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $925,000 is closer to your desired price point, it's still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to stay close to your initial price, but $925,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's split the difference and go with $875,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $875000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $900000. This is a significant investment for you, and I'm confident this product will pay off for you in the long run. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go much lower than $900,000.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it's best to buy from John for $800,000.  You're guaranteed to get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
