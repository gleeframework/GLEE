Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  A $1,000,000 price allows for some wiggle room in case Bob counters. 
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential benefits for Bob. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  This offer is still significantly higher than John's offer, giving me a strong fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and even lower than my initial offer.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Even though Bob has rejected my first offer, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a good fallback option, but I want to maximize my earnings if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my initial price point. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be very valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:**  $925,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and comfortably above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Focus on value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone can help keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to stay close to your initial price, but $925000 is still beyond my budget. Let's split the difference and go with $875000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my initial goal and the value I believe the product holds. 
* **Potential for better outcome:**  I'm confident that I can still push for a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 remains a good fallback option, but I want to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $900,000. This is a significant investment for you, and I'm confident this product will pay off for you in the long run. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (again):** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing my willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to my goal.
* **Staying above minimum:** $900,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's also a significant discount from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob about the value and potential return on investment of the product, encouraging him to see the long-term benefits of the deal.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** Maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone helps keep the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
