"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, as you know this product is worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand that the product is valuable to both of us, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to $750,000? This would still allow me to acquire the product at a reasonable cost while respecting its value to you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate, but I need to get at least $850,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's aim for a price in the middle, and we can both walk away happy.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking for a price closer to $800,000. This would better align with the value I place on the product. Would you be open to discussing this further?",800000.0,Bob,4,
