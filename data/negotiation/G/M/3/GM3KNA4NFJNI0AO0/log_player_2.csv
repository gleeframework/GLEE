"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice's offer is lower than what you're willing to pay ($100 vs $120), it's a good deal for you.  There's no need to risk a counteroffer or go to John."
