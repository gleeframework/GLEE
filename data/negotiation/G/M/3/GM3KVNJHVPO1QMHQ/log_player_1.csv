**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offers, it's clear he's very unlikely to come close to the $1,200,000 John is offering.  Continuing the negotiation with Bob is risky as he may never reach a satisfactory price. Accepting John's offer ensures Alice gets the full value she places on the product."
