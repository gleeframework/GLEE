"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I think it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $135? That's still a good deal for a product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $140 to $135, which is a good compromise.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject further offers or that the negotiation will drag on. Accepting the offer at $135 secures a good price within Bob's budget and avoids the potential hassle of further negotiation."
