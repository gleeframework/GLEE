Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, I'm still securing a substantial profit above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net, allowing me to aim higher with Bob."
