**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum selling price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly for the product's value.  How about $1,600,000? This would allow us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly higher than my preferred price point.  While it's getting closer, I'm still willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a better price.  I'll counteroffer again and try to get closer to my target."
