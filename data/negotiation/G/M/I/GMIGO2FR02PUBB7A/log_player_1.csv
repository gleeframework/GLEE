Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers.  I'm also leaving a little wiggle room in case I need to lower the price to close the deal.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own.  I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $120. Would you be willing to come down to $125?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  While it's higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything below my bottom line. I will counteroffer and try to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This price is still fair for both of us and reflects the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $130? That would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $130 is still below my ideal price point, it's getting closer to my minimum. I'm confident I can find another buyer at $150, but the risk of further negotiation dragging on increases the chance of Bob walking away entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit, albeit a smaller one."
