"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This price still gives you a good profit margin and allows me to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a good profit margin while also being a bit more affordable for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
