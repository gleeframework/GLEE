"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice:** Costs $900,000, and you value the product at $1,000,000. This means you make a profit of $100,000.
* **Buying from John:** Costs $1,000,000, and you value the product at $1,000,000. This means you break even.

It's always better to make a profit than to break even, so accepting Alice's offer is the best choice."
