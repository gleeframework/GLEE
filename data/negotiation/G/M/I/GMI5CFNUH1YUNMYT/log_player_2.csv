"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I want to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer gives me room to negotiate upwards.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone is important to keep the negotiation amicable and increase the chances of a successful deal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $1,025,000, I'm signaling that I'm serious about purchasing the product but not willing to overpay significantly. This leaves room for further negotiation while staying below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $1,025,000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to move a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we can still negotiate for a better price.  While $1,100,000 is closer to a reasonable compromise, I believe there's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,060,000 to reach a deal. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1060000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate, but keeping the increment smaller than Alice's previous concession.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:** This offer aims to land slightly above the midpoint between our previous offers, potentially enticing Alice while still leaving room for a final compromise below $1,100,000. 
* **Time Consideration:** I'm getting closer to John's offer, so continuing to negotiate in smaller increments helps me find the best possible deal with Alice before considering John's backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a way to make this work. How about $1,080,000? That's a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $1,080,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and a reasonable compromise.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate for a potentially small gain might not be worth the risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Saving Significant Money:** This price is significantly lower than John's offer, fulfilling the goal of saving money."
