"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking to invest less, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.
