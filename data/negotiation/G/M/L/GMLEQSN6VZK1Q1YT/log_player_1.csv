Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you've placed on your product, $2000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'd be willing to offer $1000000 for it.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.
