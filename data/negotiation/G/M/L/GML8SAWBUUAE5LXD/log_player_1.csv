Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we could start higher, aiming just below John's offer ($1,200,000) maximizes potential profit from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:**  The ""exclusive opportunity"" phrase encourages Bob to act quickly and consider the offer seriously. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  By emphasizing the ""potential worth"" to Bob, we remind him of the product's benefits and justify the price.

This strategy aims to secure a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) while still remaining attractive compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether."
