"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $14,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $14,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $14,500, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",14500.0,Alice,5,
