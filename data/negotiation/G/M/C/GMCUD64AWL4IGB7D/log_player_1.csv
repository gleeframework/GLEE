Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 still doesn't quite work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this sale."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. $8,900 is still a little too low for me. How about we try $8,950?  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 8950}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $8,950. I think I've been reasonable so far, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. How about we try $8,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, the negotiations have stalled and the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high. While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer for $8,800 is still a better outcome than selling to John for $8,000."
