Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,000. At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $10,000 makes the most financial sense."
