Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product extends beyond typical market valuations. Its unique features and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.

Alice is still asking too much. While her price is lower, it's still outside my budget. I'll try to bring her down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still too high for me.

I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I must be candid: if we can't find common ground closer to my previous offer, I'll need to explore other options for selling this product. I'm open to a reasonable compromise, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues what I'm offering. Let's make this work â€“ are you willing to consider a figure closer to $1,800,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is trying to pressure me, but I won't budge.  $1,800,000 is still too high. I'm going to stick to my counteroffer and see if she'll come down."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a business to run, and I respect your perspective. However, I remain committed to my initial offer of $1,200,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget constraints.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
