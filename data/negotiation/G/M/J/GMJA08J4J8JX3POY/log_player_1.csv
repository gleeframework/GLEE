Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your fallback offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $200,000 (if he gets the product at your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. A successful negotiation often involves finding a price that benefits both parties.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than my asking price. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly valuable."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Targeting Bob's Value:** This offer is significantly closer to Bob's perceived value, making it more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While it's a strong initial offer, there's still room for Bob to counter-offer, making him feel more in control of the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have a strong fallback position with John's offer, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
