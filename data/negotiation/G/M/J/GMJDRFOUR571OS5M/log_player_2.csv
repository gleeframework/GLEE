"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to me. I believe this price reflects the product's worth to you as well. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is below the product's true value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to offer $950,000 for the product at this time. I believe this price is fair considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, hoping to push Alice towards a more favorable price for him. He's leaving room for negotiation and acknowledging the value of the product while still staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I get a fair price.  How about $1,050,000?  This figure is closer to your value and allows me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise. Rejecting the offer gives him more leverage to reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  This price allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's try to close it here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum price. This is a significant step up from his previous offer, demonstrating his genuine interest in buying the product. By stating it's his maximum, he's putting pressure on Alice to accept, as rejecting this offer might lead to a stalemate or him choosing to buy from John."
