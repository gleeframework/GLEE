"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to me. I believe this price reflects the product's worth to you as well. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to offer $950,000 for the product at this time. I believe this price is fair considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I get a fair price.  How about $1,050,000?  This figure is closer to your value and allows me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  This price allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's try to close it here.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
