"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with an asking price of $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, as it's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the true value of this product and leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's keep talking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price point. Although it's closer to my budget, I still have room for negotiation.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 as a compromise.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
