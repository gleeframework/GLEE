"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll see the value it brings.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?"", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $500,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $700,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  This product will be worth more than that to you in the long run, and it gives me a reasonable return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her offers are still significantly higher than your maximum budget. You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000.  There's no point in risking further negotiation rounds with Alice when you can get the product at your target price elsewhere."
