Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but not too high to scare Bob off.  I want to see if he's interested and how much he's willing to pay.  We can negotiate from there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, so I'll take it. It's better to sell to Bob for $80 than to John for the same amount, because I don't need to spend time negotiating further."
