"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $11,000. I believe this product will be highly beneficial for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a lower price, getting closer to Alice's value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still gives room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Aiming for a Win-Win:**  This price point would be a good deal for me while still giving Alice a profit. My goal is to find a price that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your position, the product's value is quite high.  Could you meet me at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Alice moving down to $10,000 shows she's willing to negotiate.  There's a good chance we can reach a better price.
* **Alternative Option:**  I still have the option to buy from John at $12,000, so I'm not desperate to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm meeting Alice halfway between her offer ($10,000) and my previous counteroffer ($9,000). 
* **Showing Willingness to Negotiate:**  This counteroffer signals that I'm serious about buying but still looking for the best possible price. 
* **Staying Below My Maximum:** This price point keeps me well below my $12,000 maximum and provides a good balance between getting a good deal and securing the product."
