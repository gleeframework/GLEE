"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than what the product is worth to her.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  It's also worth noting that Bob has 10 rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $880,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $880,000, but Bob can still potentially get a better price.  He is still within his target price range, and the negotiation is moving in the right direction. There are still 7 rounds remaining, so there is time to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $880,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit off. I'm willing to offer $860,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes your need to profit while remaining within my budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 860000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $870,000. This is a fair price that balances our needs and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $870,000. This is a good deal for Bob, as it is significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and still allows Alice to make a profit.  While Bob could try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might reject further offers and the deal could fall apart.  With only 5 rounds left, it's a good time to secure the deal and avoid potential complications."
