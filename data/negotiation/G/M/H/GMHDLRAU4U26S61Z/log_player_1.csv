Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm implying that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the flow of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:**  Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate if I can get my minimum right now.
* **Time Factor:**  There's no indication that John's offer is time-sensitive.  I'm not losing anything by accepting Bob's offer right away.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a better price, but it also carries the risk of Bob rejecting future offers or even walking away entirely.  It's not worth the risk for a $20 potential gain."
