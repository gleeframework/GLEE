"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  This allows for potential negotiation and a chance to maximize my profit. 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  A high initial offer establishes a strong starting point for the negotiation. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high price provides space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's being forced to pay an unreasonable amount.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** By seeing how Bob responds, I can gauge his potential value for the product and adjust my offers accordingly.

**Note:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm not going to settle for less than $1,200,000, so I'm keeping a close eye on the rounds and will switch to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $1,500,000.  There are still 8 rounds remaining, and there's potential to close the deal with Bob at a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Bob's offer is my minimum, but there's a chance to gain more profit with some negotiation. 
* **Strategic Approach:**  Rejecting the offer now allows me to explore other options and gauge Bob's seriousness about the deal. 
* **Time is on My Side:** With 8 rounds left, I can afford to be patient and see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll need to analyze Bob's offer and determine if he's serious about buying the product at a price closer to my desired range. If not, I'll have to consider selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer is $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer of $1,500,000, but it still leaves room for further negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Signal of Willingness to Negotiate:**  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price higher than Bob's initial offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** I'm gauging Bob's commitment to the deal by seeing if he's willing to meet me halfway. 
* **Balance of Power:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not giving up on my goal of maximizing my profit. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John as a Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll be closer to considering selling to John, as my remaining time is shrinking.
* **Analyzing Bob's Response:**  How Bob responds to this offer will reveal his true willingness to pay and influence my decisions for the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $1,100,000. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I believe there's still potential for a better deal, especially with 6 rounds remaining. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Improvement:**  I'm not convinced Bob's offer is his final stance, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to close the deal at a higher price point.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a safe option, but I'm still trying to secure a better price. There's a risk of losing the deal entirely if I'm too stubborn, but I'm willing to take that risk at this point. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make another counteroffer to Bob.  My goal is to find a compromise that gets me closer to my desired price while still keeping the negotiation moving. If Bob continues to offer significantly lower prices, I'll seriously consider selling to John as the rounds become more limited."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer is $1,300,000. I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still aiming for a price higher than Bob's last offer.  With five rounds remaining, I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal, but I'm not giving up on getting a better price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:**  I'm attempting to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and my desired price.
* **Limited Time:**  With only five rounds left, I'm starting to consider the potential for a deal falling through.  I'm trying to close the gap while still maintaining a respectable profit margin.
* **Assessing Bob's Intent:**  This counteroffer will help me understand if Bob is seriously interested in buying the product at a price close to mine or if he's simply trying to lowball me.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as the risk of losing the deal altogether becomes more significant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price, and with only four rounds left, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob is too high.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only four rounds remaining, the possibility of reaching a deal with Bob at a satisfactory price is becoming increasingly unlikely.
* **Protecting My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is well below my minimum acceptable price, and there's no guarantee that he'll move higher in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John provides a guaranteed profit of $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and ensures that I don't lose out on the deal.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is high, as there's a chance that we won't reach a deal, leaving me with nothing.  The reward is the potential for a higher price, but the probability of achieving that is uncertain. 
* **Minimizing Losses:**  Selling to John allows me to minimize potential losses by securing a guaranteed sale at my minimum price.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the time constraint and Bob's unwillingness to move closer to my desired price make selling to John the most prudent decision at this point."
