,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $130 for the product.  Let's keep talking and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
