"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. It's worth continuing to negotiate and seeing if I can get him closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $130 for the product.  Let's keep talking and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I think this price is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $115 is getting closer to my minimum price of $120.  While I would prefer to get even closer, continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale to Bob altogether or having to sell to John for $120.  It's better to accept the offer and secure a sale."
