"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value; however, the price you're proposing doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it holds. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,450,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
