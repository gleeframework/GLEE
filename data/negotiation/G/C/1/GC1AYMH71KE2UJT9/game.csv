"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $9000. However, I'm willing to consider a price of $11000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go below $11000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $9500. I'll offer you the product for $10500. This is my final compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll accept your offer, but I need to add a small premium to cover the costs. I'll sell the product to you for $10500.",10500.0,Alice,7,
