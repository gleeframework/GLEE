I'm starting with a price higher than what I need to make a profit, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm going to counteroffer instead of selling to John. There's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and be willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

```

While I would prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $130 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's better to secure a sale now than to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing."
