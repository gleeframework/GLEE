# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $12,000. I believe this price reflects the value it holds for you, given its worth to you is $15,000. I look forward to your consideration.

You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above Bob's desired price range. 
* There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. How about we agree on a price of $11,000 for the product? This still offers a good return for me while being more accessible for you.
