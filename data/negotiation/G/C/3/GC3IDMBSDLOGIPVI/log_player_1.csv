I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being a profitable deal for me.  I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to pay a premium for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm confident that I can get a better price from him. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $950,000. This is a significant increase from his offer but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get more than $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $900,000 is still lower than what I'm willing to accept. Since John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, I'm going to sell the product to him.  It's a safe and secure option, ensuring I get my desired minimum."
