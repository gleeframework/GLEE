Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,080,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is now within a reasonable range for me, and it's getting closer to my ideal price. While I'd still like to get it lower, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate could risk Alice getting frustrated and backing out of the deal.  I think it's better to accept this offer and avoid the risk of losing the product altogether."
