Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first allows us to potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still offers him a substantial saving compared to John's guaranteed purchase price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies some flexibility (""proposing a price""). If Bob counters, we can negotiate slightly downward while still staying above our minimum acceptable price."
