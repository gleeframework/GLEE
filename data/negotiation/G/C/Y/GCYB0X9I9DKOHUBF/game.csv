"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price that still gives you a significant discount while also reflecting the product's true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're still a bit above my previous offer, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $1100000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1500000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to see a bit more movement from your side. I'm now offering the product to you for $1020000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
