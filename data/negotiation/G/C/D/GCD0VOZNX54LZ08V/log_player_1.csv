Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also considering that my minimum acceptable price is $15,000, so this gives me some wiggle room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is within my acceptable range, and it's likely I won't be able to get a better price. It's better to accept and secure the sale."
