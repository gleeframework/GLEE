"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,250,000. I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, but this is a significant discount from the value it holds for me.  It's a chance to secure a valuable asset at a great price. Consider this offer carefully; I have another interested buyer willing to pay $1,500,000, but I would prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
