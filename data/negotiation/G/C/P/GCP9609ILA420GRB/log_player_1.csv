Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm also considering that Bob might be willing to pay more, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for significantly less than my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still above my minimum. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I'm getting impatient. I'd rather close the deal now than risk further negotiation or selling to John for less."
