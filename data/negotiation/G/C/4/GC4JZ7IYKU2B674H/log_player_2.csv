"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can potentially get the product for a much lower price.  It's worth exploring further negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product,  which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Fairness Argument:**  You're framing it as a fair price for both parties.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $650,000 is a significant reduction, it leaves room for negotiation if Alice needs to come up a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  Alice's offer of $800,000 is a good deal for you, considering your maximum budget is $1,500,000 and the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. 
* **Potential for Future Savings:** While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your counteroffer, potentially leaving you with a worse deal or having to buy from John for a much higher price. 
* **Time is of the Essence:** You have limited rounds to close the deal, and it's wise to secure a good deal rather than risk losing the opportunity."
