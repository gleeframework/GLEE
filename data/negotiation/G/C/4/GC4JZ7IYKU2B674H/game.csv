"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product,  which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,3,
