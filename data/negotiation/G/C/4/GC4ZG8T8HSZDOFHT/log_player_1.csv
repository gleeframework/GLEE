"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm curious to see what Bob's reaction will be and whether he sees value in the product at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy to sell for $120, I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll start by trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $150 and Bob's offer of $120. I believe this price is still fair and reflects the value of the product. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is a decent compromise. It's higher than what John would pay and closer to my desired price. I'm accepting his offer to secure the sale and avoid further negotiation."
