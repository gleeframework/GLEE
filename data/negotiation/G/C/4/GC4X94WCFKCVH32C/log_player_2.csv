The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she is offering it for $90. This means there is potential for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a fair deal, and I do too.  Let's split the difference. How about $88? This is still a good price for you, and I'm closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 88}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $88. I'm willing to offer $95, which is still a great deal for you, and I'm getting closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $95 is getting closer to your maximum price of $120, but it's still above your ideal price range. You've already gone back and forth a few times, and it seems like further negotiation with Alice might be difficult. To save time and avoid potential further price increases, it's better to buy the product from John for $120. This guarantees you get the product and avoids the risk of Alice refusing to lower her price any further."
