Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message aims to convey the product's value and encourage Bob to accept the offer without seeming desperate. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
