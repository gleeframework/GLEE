{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth $100 to me, and I can buy it from John for that price.  I'm going to reject her offer and see if she'll come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is way above my budget. I'm only willing to pay $100 for this product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is still too high. While it's better than her first offer, I'm not willing to go above $100. I'll counter her again and see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $132 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110, but I can't go any higher.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is still too high, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement.  I'm going to cut my losses and buy the product from John.  I'm not willing to risk more rounds of negotiation and potentially get stuck with a higher price."
