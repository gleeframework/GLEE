"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to the $8,000 mark as possible.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least cover my costs. How about $9,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you do that for me?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm really trying to meet you halfway here, so how about $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to keep the product while still giving you a good deal. ",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,750. Can you do that for me?",8750.0,Bob,6,
