"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $8,000 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what I want to get, but still higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if he counters. I'm also emphasizing the value he'll get from the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to the $8,000 mark as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least cover my costs. How about $9,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you do that for me? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I believe I can still get a better offer from Bob or potentially from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm really trying to meet you halfway here, so how about $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to keep the product while still giving you a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,750. Can you do that for me? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. 

Even though Bob has been willing to negotiate, the price he's offering is still significantly lower than my minimum value. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from him.  

John is a sure thing, and I can secure my minimum desired price without any further negotiation."
