Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I think this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than my fallback option (John).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **High but Justifiable:** The offer is high but justifiable considering Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). 
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language to highlight the product's value and present a strong case for the price.

By starting high, I increase the chances of securing a deal closer to Bob's maximum valuation while still having John as a reliable backup."
