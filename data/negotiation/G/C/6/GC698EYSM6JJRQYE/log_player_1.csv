Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below your minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting you closer to your desired profit.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning that you'll list it publicly implies there are other interested buyers, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between enticing Bob while ensuring you don't lose out on potential profit from selling to John."
