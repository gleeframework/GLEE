,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a great deal for you, and it's still fair to me. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. I understand your price point, but $105 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  This would be a win-win for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
