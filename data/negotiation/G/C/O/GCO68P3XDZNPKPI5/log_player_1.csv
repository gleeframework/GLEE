Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me.  I'm more comfortable in the $1,100,000 range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I can still potentially get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,175,000 is getting closer to my target, I think I can still push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. It's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1225000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm feeling like we're getting close. How about we make it $1,200,000 even? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my target with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! How about $1,210,000? It's just a small difference from your last offer, and it brings us closer to a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1210000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  $1,200,000 is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would love to get closer to $1,250,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer at $1,200,000 is still a good profit and secures the sale. It's better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
