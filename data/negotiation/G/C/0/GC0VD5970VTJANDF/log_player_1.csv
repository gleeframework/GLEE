Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired profit. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still staying above my minimum threshold.  I believe this is a fair compromise that will encourage Bob to accept."
