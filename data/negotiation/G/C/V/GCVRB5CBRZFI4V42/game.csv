"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I can't go as low as $90, I'm willing to drop the price a bit to $105. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  This would allow me to make the sale and you to get a great product at a fair price.",100.0,Alice,5,

I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider my offer?,92.0,Bob,6,
