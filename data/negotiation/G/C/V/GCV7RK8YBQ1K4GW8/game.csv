"Alice, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,900000.0
"Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 was a bit high, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the incredible value this product brings.",900000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,850000.0
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $750,000, but I'm still not sure if that's enough to justify the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $900,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is my best and final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,,
