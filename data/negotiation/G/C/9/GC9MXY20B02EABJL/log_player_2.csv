**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her valuation:** Alice is willing to sell for $1,400,000, but it's only worth $1,200,000 to her. This suggests there might be room for negotiation.
* **You have a better alternative:** You can buy the product from John for $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or explore other options. 

**The best strategy is to reject Alice's offer and try to get a better price.**"
