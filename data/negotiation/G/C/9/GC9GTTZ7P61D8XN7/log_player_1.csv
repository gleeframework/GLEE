Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see what Bob's response is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better price. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering $90. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping he'll find this more appealing and we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $85.  It's a good price considering my minimum value and the risk of further negotiation. While I'd ideally prefer $90, the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and then having to sell to John for $80 is too high."
