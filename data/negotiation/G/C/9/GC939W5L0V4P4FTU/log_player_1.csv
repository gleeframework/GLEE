"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm asking for $22,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm starting significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** The message highlights ""unique features and benefits,"" aiming to subtly increase the perceived value in Bob's mind.
* **Open for Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's input, signaling my willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to understand Bob's negotiation style and upper limit quickly. By starting high, I hope to:

* **Anchor:** Influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Gather Information:**  His counteroffer will reveal how aggressively he's willing to negotiate.

I'm keeping the $15,000 offer from John as a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $22,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $11,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he's shown a willingness to negotiate, his first offer is a common tactic to try and anchor the negotiation in his favor. I need to demonstrate that I'm also a tough negotiator and there's a significant gap to bridge. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and come back with a counteroffer that is still above my minimum, but shows some movement towards his price range. This keeps the negotiation active while still aiming for a higher selling price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, $11,000 is significantly below its true worth. Could you consider something closer to $19,000?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but firm:**  I'm lowering my price by $3,000, showing flexibility but not desperation. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob about the product's value to prevent him from anchoring too low.
* **Open Question:** I'm asking an open question (""Could you consider..."") to encourage him to engage in a discussion rather than just throwing back another low offer.

**Strategy:**

My goal in this round is to establish a negotiation range closer to my desired price point. I'm still aiming high, but I'm open to seeing how Bob responds to this counteroffer. I'm keeping the $15,000 backup option from John in mind, but I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $11,000 is lower than you'd like, but I'm working within a fixed budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my absolute minimum acceptable price of $15,000. There's no point in risking further negotiation or potentially losing the deal. This offer is equal to John's offer, and it's always preferable to close a deal with the original interested party if possible."
