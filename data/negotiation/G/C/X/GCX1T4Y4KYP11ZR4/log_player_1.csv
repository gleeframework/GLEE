Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,800,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** I don't know Bob's valuation, so I'm aiming for a high initial offer to gauge his interest and potential negotiation range.
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which acts as a safety net. If Bob rejects my offer and I'm not satisfied with his counteroffers, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  I need to negotiate further to get closer to a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John's offer provides leverage:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** My counteroffer of $1,500,000 is still high but represents a compromise from my initial offer. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also emphasizes the value I see in the product.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  This price is closer to the middle ground between Bob's initial offer of $800,000 and my initial offer of $1,800,000. This increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:** I'm still aware of John's offer, which gives me the confidence to stand firm on a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiations are not fruitful:** Bob seems unwilling to meet my price expectations, and further negotiations might be time-consuming.
* **John's offer is more advantageous:** Since John is willing to pay $1,200,000, it's more beneficial for me to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
