{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good discount, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is $925,000, which is only $25,000 more than my counteroffer. Considering John is selling for $1,000,000, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice. It saves me $75,000 compared to buying from John."
