{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's above Bob's value but below my minimum. This allows for some room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? This would still be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob has come up a little in his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. It's clear we're not going to reach a mutually acceptable price. To avoid further negotiation, I'll sell the product to John for $120."
