# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,500.** This is still more than what the product is worth to you ($10,000).
* **John's offer is $10,000.** While this is your maximum budget, it's still a better deal than Alice's offer. 

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $10,000 saves you $500."
