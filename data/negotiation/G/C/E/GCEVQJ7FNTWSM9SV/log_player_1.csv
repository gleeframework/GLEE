Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $162. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $162
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  $162 is a good price, and I'm not sure I can get much higher in the remaining rounds.  It's also better than selling to John for $150."
