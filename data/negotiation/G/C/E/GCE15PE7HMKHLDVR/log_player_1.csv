I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $14,000 is better than $10,000, but I think I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 
I'm going to counter with $14,500. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still believe this product is worth more than $14,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $14,200 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  It's also a lot better than selling to John for $10,000."
