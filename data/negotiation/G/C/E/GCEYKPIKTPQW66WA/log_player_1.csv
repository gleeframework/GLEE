Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting near that figure is strategic.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting in the middle. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so there's a safety net if Bob declines.
* **Confident and Respectful Tone:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and respecting Bob's opinion.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the possibility of accepting John's offer if necessary."
