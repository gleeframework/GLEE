Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's already offered a price of $880,000 and Alice has moved slightly closer to that price.  It seems they are close to a deal.  A counter-offer closer to $900,000 might be enough to seal the deal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can still technically negotiate a bit lower, he's already come down from his original offer to $900,000 and Alice has met him halfway.  If he continues to reject offers, he risks Alice backing out of the negotiation entirely or he might end up buying from John for $1,000,000."
