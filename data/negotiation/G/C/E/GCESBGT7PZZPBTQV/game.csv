"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $850,000.  I think that's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $880,000?  That's a significant discount from your original offer and still gives you a good profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $880,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $915,000? I think we can find a mutually beneficial price in this range.",915000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I think we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about $920,000? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",920000.0,Alice,7,
