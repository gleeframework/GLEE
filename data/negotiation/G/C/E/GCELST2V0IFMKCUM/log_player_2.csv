"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. My asking price is $10,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",

```

This counter-offer aims to establish a starting point significantly lower than Alice's asking price while still leaving room for negotiation. It also conveys interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a great product, and I think it would be worth the investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than the initial offer, we still have room to negotiate before reaching our $12,000 walk-away point (John's price)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counter-offer proposes a price directly in between Alice's current offer ($9,000) and our previous offer ($7,000). This strategy is often perceived as fair and might make Alice more receptive. 
* **Targeting Alice's Value:** $8,000 is likely Alice's point of indifference (she values the product at $8,000). Offering this price might be our best chance to secure the product while staying significantly below our $12,000 limit.
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:** While we're aiming for $8,000, there's still some wiggle room to negotiate slightly higher if Alice rejects this offer outright."
