{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. My asking price is $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
This offer sets a starting point that is higher than your minimum, but still attractive to Bob as it's lower than the product's worth to him. This approach allows for potential negotiation, maximizing your chances of earning more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a great product, and I think it would be worth the investment for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to sell for more, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for the same price."
