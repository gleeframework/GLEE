"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  I think it could be incredibly beneficial for you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a solution that works well for both of us.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I see the value in the product, but  $2,300,000 is not feasible for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  However, $1,000,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind. Let's meet somewhere in the middle; how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a good deal here. While $1,900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more manageable. Would you consider $1,200,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  $1,200,000 is still a significant gap from what I'm looking for. To make this work, I need to stay above $1,500,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal. How about we settle at $1,400,000?  That demonstrates my seriousness about purchasing while acknowledging the value of your product.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
