Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential negotiation and a faster sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,450,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for him to counter-offer.  
* **Confident Messaging:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a reflection of that value, encouraging Bob to seriously consider the offer.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still keeping the option of selling to John open if negotiations fail."
