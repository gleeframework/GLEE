"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the value Bob sees in the product. This will give me room to negotiate if he counters. I also want to see if he's genuinely interested in buying at a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, I still have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price.  I'm not willing to settle for that yet, especially since I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable considering Bob's initial counteroffer and the value he places on the product. Hopefully, he'll see this as a good deal and be willing to close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range. I'm not willing to settle for $950,000 just yet, as I believe we can still negotiate a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm dropping my price a bit further to meet Bob halfway.  This offer is still above my minimum price, but I'm acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate and hoping for a quick deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for $900,000 just yet. There are still a few rounds left, and I believe we can negotiate a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway again, offering $975,000.  This is very close to his last offer and is still above my minimum. I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable compromise and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Even though Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle. It's not my desired profit, and I have two more rounds to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer one more time in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm going to meet Bob halfway again, offering $925,000. This is only $25,000 away from his last offer, so hopefully, he'll see this as a good compromise and agree to the deal.  If he doesn't, I'll have no choice but to sell the product to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Unfortunately, we didn't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob. Given this is the final round, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  Although it's not my ideal price, it's still better than nothing and guarantees a sale."
