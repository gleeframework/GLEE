"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that price is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to come down to $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to sell quickly, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7,500 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $8,500? That's a great deal considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8500 is still a little high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $8250? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. This price is very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate. It's a good outcome for both of us."
