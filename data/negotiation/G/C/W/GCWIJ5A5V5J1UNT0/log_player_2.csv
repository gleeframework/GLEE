It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  The goal is to save money, and $90 is more than the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $75 for the product. This is a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us."

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again and try to get closer to my target price."

I'm increasing my offer to $78. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's fair to both of us."
