"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand you were thinking of $9000, but I'm not quite comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $10000. Would you be willing to consider $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit above $10000, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm counteroffering at $12000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $10250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is my last offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $11500 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, so I'll go a bit lower. I'm thinking of $10750. Can you consider that?",10750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $12000. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $12250. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",12250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid we've reached an impasse, Alice. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to a mutually agreeable price. I'll make one final offer: $10000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",10000.0,Bob,10,
