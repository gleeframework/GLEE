"Alice, your offer of $2,000,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice,  I understand the value of the product, but $1,750,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
