Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,100,000. I believe it offers significant value for that price, especially considering its potential benefits for you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value and potential benefits for Bob might make him more amenable to the high price.

This strategy aims for the best-case scenario: Bob accepts the initial offer or negotiates down slightly, resulting in a sale significantly above your minimum."
