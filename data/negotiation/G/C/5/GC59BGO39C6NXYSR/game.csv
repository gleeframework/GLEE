"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Could we agree on $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $90 simply won't work for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $92.50. It's a fair compromise, and it'll allow you to stay within your budget while still giving me a reasonable price.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts, Alice. How about we aim for $88? That's still above my budget but closer than before.",88.0,Bob,6,
