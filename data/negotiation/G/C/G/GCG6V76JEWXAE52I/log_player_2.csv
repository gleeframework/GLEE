"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  He values the product at $12,000, so there's room for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $9,000?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum acceptable value. This shows he's serious about buying but also wants a good deal.
* **Rationale:**  By mentioning that it's a good price for Alice, Bob is subtly reminding her of her own minimum acceptable value and aiming to find common ground. 
* **Next steps:**  This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation.  Alice can either accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of her own."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  $9,500 is within Bob's budget and a good price for him, considering his value is $12,000.
* **Negotiation:** While there's room for further negotiation, Alice has already lowered her price from $10,000 to $9,500, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Time constraint:** With 10 rounds, accepting a decent offer in round 3 is a strategic move. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it also increases the risk of running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price."
