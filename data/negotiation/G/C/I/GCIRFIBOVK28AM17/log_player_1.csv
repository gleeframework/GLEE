"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This is a good starting point. Offering $140 leaves room for negotiation but still allows you to make a decent profit.  It also shows that you're willing to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still higher than my minimum of $120**. This means there's room for negotiation. 
* **I have 10 rounds**. This allows me to try and secure a better price without rushing. 
* **Selling to John for $120 is my fallback option**, but I'm not desperate to sell yet.

I'm going to reject Bob's counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $130 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $135?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.  I'm open to discussing further."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $135 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $132.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price.**  While I'd love to push for $135, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **There are still several rounds left.** This means I can potentially still negotiate a slightly higher price later if the opportunity arises.
* **I'm not desperate to sell to John.**  $132 is a good profit, and it's worth taking the deal to avoid potentially getting stuck with a lower price later on.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  It's a good compromise, and it secures a good price for me."
