"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,050,000?  This price is still fair considering the value this product brings.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? That way, we can both walk away happy.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
