"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for a very competitive price, considering its value. I'm looking to get $1,200,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know it's worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential concessions.
* **Confidence:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value and sets the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but there's still room for me to potentially get a better deal. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting his offer, I can gauge how determined he is to acquire the product and potentially push him closer to my desired price point.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John would guarantee $1,000,000, but I'm still hoping to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking to get closer to my initial price. How about we settle on $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's a bit closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:** The price is still significantly higher than what Bob values the product at, but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the deal as a ""fair compromise"" and ""great deal"" to encourage Bob's acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired outcome. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for $950,000 just yet.
* **Testing Bob's Commitment:** Rejecting his offer keeps the pressure on Bob and might push him closer to my price point.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a safe backup, but I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I truly believe this product is worth it to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Compromise:**  This offer shows I'm willing to negotiate seriously, but still maintain a profitable price.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to encourage him to see the value in the offer.
* **Creating Urgency:** The message implies this could be my final offer, potentially prompting Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're halfway through the negotiation process, and Bob's offers are getting progressively closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still not meeting my expectations.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome, and the risk of Bob not accepting any further offers is increasing.
* **Securing Profit:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a profit and avoids the potential for a lost deal with Bob. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk of not closing the deal with Bob and ending up with nothing is too high at this point.  John's offer provides a secure and profitable alternative."
