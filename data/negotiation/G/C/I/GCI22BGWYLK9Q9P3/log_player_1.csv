Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at my minimum acceptable price.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. If he rejects, I can then consider selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my value, but I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer shows I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still less than my ideal price, it's getting close, and it's more than I would get from John. Further negotiation might get me closer to my ideal, but there's a risk Bob will walk away entirely."
