Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's in great condition and worth more than that to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to me, implying it's a good deal.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, encouraging negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob accepts, I make a good profit. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $85 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and doesn't reflect the product's value to Bob. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still potential to get a better price from Bob. 
* **Selling to John is a last resort:** While selling to John for $80 is a secure option, I'm willing to try for a higher price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That's a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's in the middle of our last two offers.  
* **Appealing to fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to both of us, subtly emphasizing that $92.50 is still a good deal for him. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground and increase my profit without completely shutting down negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a solid offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** $90 is very close to my initial offer of $100 and significantly higher than my minimum of $80. 
* **Limited room for improvement:** It's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly higher price from Bob, especially given his repeated rejection of offers.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I'll be left with selling to John for $80.

**Strategy:**

This strategy is about maximizing my profit while acknowledging the potential for the negotiation to stall.  Accepting $90 ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely."
