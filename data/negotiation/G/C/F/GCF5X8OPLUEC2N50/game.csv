"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm excited about the possibility of purchasing it. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1000000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1250000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you've offered. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000 is too high, but $1150000 is a bit more reasonable. Let's meet in the middle at $1175000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
