{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($1,200,000)  is a good strategy.  This shows Alice you are serious about negotiating, and the offer is still within the range of what you are willing to pay. It will likely be rejected by Alice, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, there's still room for negotiation.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

Since you have a few rounds left, there's still time to try and bring the price down further."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your upper limit, but there's still a chance to get a better price. It's worth continuing the negotiation for a few more rounds. You have a few rounds left, and rejecting the offer allows you to continue pushing for a lower price. You might be able to reach a deal closer to your desired price point with a few more counteroffers."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation process, and Alice has been steadily reducing her price.  This counteroffer is a significant jump from your previous offer, showcasing that you are willing to get closer to Alice's price, but still pushing for a better deal. Since you only have a few rounds left, it is important to make a bold counteroffer to try and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is just $50,000 higher than your previous counteroffer, and with only one round left, the risk of rejecting the offer and going to John is too high.  There's little room for further negotiation, and accepting Alice's offer guarantees a purchase within your budget. You've successfully negotiated a price significantly lower than Alice's initial asking price, and the risk of losing out on the deal by continuing the negotiation is greater than the potential savings."
