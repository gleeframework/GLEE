# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think it's a fantastic deal, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000.  It makes more financial sense to reject Alice's offer and secure a significant saving by purchasing from John."
