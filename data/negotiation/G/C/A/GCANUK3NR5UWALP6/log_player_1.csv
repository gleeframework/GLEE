"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle? Would $15,000 work for you?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,500? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

While I could push for a bit more, $13,500 is a reasonable profit above my minimum. It's better to secure a deal now than risk Bob walking away."
