"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $9,000. What are your thoughts?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,200. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to accept $8,200 just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $8,400, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",8400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're holding firm, but $8,400 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to go up to $8,300.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",8300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $8,400. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $8,350. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",8350.0,Alice,7,
