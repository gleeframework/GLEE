Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of great value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a slightly lower price.
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  The offer needs to be significantly higher than John's $10,000 to avoid settling for the lower price unnecessarily. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale with Bob."
