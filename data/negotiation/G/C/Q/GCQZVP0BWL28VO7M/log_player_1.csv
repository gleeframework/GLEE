Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation if necessary. I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a price closer to my ideal selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum price and is still a decent profit. I'll accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
