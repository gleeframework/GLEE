"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, you can potentially save even more money by counteroffering. You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9,000, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $10,000 and the value she places on the product ($8,000). This is a reasonable compromise that should incentivize her to accept while still giving me a significant discount."
