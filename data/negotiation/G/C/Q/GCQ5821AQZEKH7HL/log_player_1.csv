Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still exceeding my minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Optional):** While I haven't included it in this message, starting slightly higher gives me some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects my offer, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
