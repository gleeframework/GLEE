Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm going to start high, at my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider whether to lower my price or sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better counteroffer from him.  $90 is significantly less than my minimum, and I'm not willing to take such a big loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm going to come down a little bit from my initial price, but I'm still holding out for a significant profit. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, given his own valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at his own valuation of the product, which means I'm unlikely to get a better price from him.  While I'd prefer to sell to John for $120, I'm also not willing to risk a lengthy negotiation that might result in him walking away entirely.  Accepting this offer will guarantee me a sale and a decent profit."
