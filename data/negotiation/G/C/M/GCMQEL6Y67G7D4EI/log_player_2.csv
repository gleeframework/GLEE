"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price point.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's likely Alice will counter with a price closer to your offer, but if she rejects, you'll continue to lower the price until you reach a point where it's either worth it or you go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, you can still push for a better deal. Rejecting the offer will allow you to counter with a price closer to your $8,500 target, putting more pressure on Alice to make a concession."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. If you're not willing to go lower, I'm going to have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer reiterates your previous offer and emphasizes your commitment to it.  It also subtly hints at the alternative of buying from John, which could motivate Alice to accept your offer."
