While $8,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still a bit higher than $8,200. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $8,300? It's closer to your offer, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 8300}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to pay $8,250 for the product. This brings us closer to my maximum budget while still offering a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $8,250 is only $250 away from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's time to close the deal.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might change his mind or that we won't reach an agreement.  It's better to secure this price and move on."
