Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and still being attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **For me:** It's significantly higher than my floor price of $12,000, meaning a substantial profit.
* **For Bob:** It's still a good deal for him, as he values the product at $15,000. 

By offering $14,000, I increase the chances of Bob accepting, while still securing a good profit. If he rejects, I have the fallback option of selling to John for $12,000."
