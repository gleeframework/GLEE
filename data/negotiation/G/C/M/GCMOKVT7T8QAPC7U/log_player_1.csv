Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but still gives me a significant profit.  I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired $14,000.  I'll counteroffer to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,500.  This is still a good profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise after Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $13,000. This is a good price, as it's closer to my desired price of $14,000.  I'm confident that continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob entirely, and then I would only be able to sell the product to John for $10,000. It's important to know when to compromise and secure a good deal rather than risk getting nothing."
