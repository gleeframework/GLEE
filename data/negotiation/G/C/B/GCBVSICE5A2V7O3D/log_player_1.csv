Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 99
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you could offer the product at $100 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** By offering the product at $99, you're aiming for the highest price Bob might be willing to pay while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Creating Urgency (Implied):** The phrase ""special price"" subtly implies this offer might not last, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
