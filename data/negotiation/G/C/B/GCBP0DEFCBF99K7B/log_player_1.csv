Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm offering Bob the product for $900,000. This is a higher price than John's offer, so I can potentially earn more money. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's always a risk that Bob will reject my offer. But if he accepts, I make an extra $100,000.
* **Unknown Value:**  Since I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob, I'm starting with a price that is higher than John's offer, but not excessively high.  
* **Potential Negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can always try to negotiate with him further. 

I'm hoping that the potential for a higher profit outweighs the risk of Bob rejecting my offer."
