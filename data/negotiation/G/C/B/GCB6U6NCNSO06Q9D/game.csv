"Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what you would be willing to pay for it elsewhere. It's also a fair price for me, allowing me to make a good profit while still leaving room for you to make a substantial gain. Please let me know your decision.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
