Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Ensure Profit over Guaranteed Sale:** While selling to John guarantees $80, there's a chance to earn significantly more from Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high asking price and a reasonable chance of acceptance."
