"Alice, your offer is still too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $850,000. This is a fair price given the value I place on it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This still offers you a significant value, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to buying the product. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too far below what the product is worth.  Let's be realistic.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects both your needs and mine, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a good faith effort to reach a deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000.  This product is truly unique and holds significant value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to explore other options. ",1050000.0,Alice,7,
