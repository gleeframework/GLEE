"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum but leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to motivate Bob by highlighting the value the product offers him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $850,000. This is a fair price given the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer to try and bridge the gap, but I'm also keeping the option to sell to John open if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This still offers you a significant value, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to buying the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$950,000 is still too far away from my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm starting to get a little nervous. It's important to find a balance between pushing for a good price and not losing Bob altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too far below what the product is worth.  Let's be realistic.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects both your needs and mine, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a good faith effort to reach a deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is tempting, it's still too far below my minimum. I'm running out of time, but I need to hold out for a better price. I'm going to counteroffer one last time before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000.  This product is truly unique and holds significant value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to explore other options.
