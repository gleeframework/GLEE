,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  Would you consider a price of $10500?  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come away happy.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $9500 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to make another compromise.  How about we split the difference and agree on $10000? I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a satisfactory outcome.",10000.0,Alice,5,
