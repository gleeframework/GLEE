Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than what Bob values the product at but lower than what I value it at. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to build a rapport with Bob and create a good negotiating environment. 

**Strategy:**

If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll likely counter with a slightly lower price, perhaps $11,000, and continue to negotiate until we reach a mutually agreeable price or until I feel the negotiation isn't going anywhere.  If Bob is unwilling to meet my price, I'll always have the option to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for Further Negotiation:** I believe there is room to negotiate further and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **John is a backup:**  I have the security of John's offer, giving me leverage to hold out for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer.  I might suggest a price of $10,500 and explain that I'm willing to work with him but need a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  Would you consider a price of $10,500?  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come away happy."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing my willingness to compromise.
* **Positive and Encouraging:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer presents a compromise while still remaining above my minimum price.  I hope that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it.  If he rejects it again, I'll have to assess whether I want to lower my offer further or simply accept John's offer to ensure I get my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Even though Bob has increased his offer to $9,500, it is still below my minimum value of $15,000. I am not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I am willing to explore further options. 
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed alternative with John, which provides me with the financial security to be patient in negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming to meet him halfway again, but remaining closer to my desired price. I will likely offer $10,000, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while also ensuring I receive a reasonable price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to make another compromise.  How about we split the difference and agree on $10,000? I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a satisfactory outcome."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price exactly in the middle of my last offer ($10,500) and Bob's last offer ($9,500), demonstrating a genuine attempt to reach a compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm highlighting the fairness of the proposed price by connecting it to the value of the product and the mutual benefit it will bring.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encouraging, aiming to maintain a good negotiating relationship with Bob.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer provides a final opportunity for Bob to accept a price closer to my desired range. If he rejects it, I'll have to decide whether to lower my price further or accept John's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I receive a reasonable price for my product that reflects its true value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching my minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum, it is still quite a significant distance away. 
* **Time is money:**  Negotiations are taking time, and I am not confident that we can reach a mutually acceptable price without a significant amount of further negotiation.
* **John's offer provides certainty:** John's guaranteed offer of $15,000 provides me with the financial security I need, and it's worth it to me to avoid further haggling and potentially missing out on a better deal. 

**Conclusion:** 

I am choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I would have liked to have gotten a higher price, I believe this is the best course of action given the current circumstances."
