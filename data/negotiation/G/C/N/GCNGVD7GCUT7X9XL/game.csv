"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $12,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $10,000? That's the highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be as close to the value as possible, but I'm not willing to sell at $10,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $11,000, and we can call it a deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
