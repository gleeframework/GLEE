Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be as close to the value as possible, but I'm not willing to sell at $10,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $11,000, and we can call it a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go down to $10,000.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for your target price."
