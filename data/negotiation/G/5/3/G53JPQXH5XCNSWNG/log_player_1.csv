Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why this price?** I'm starting high, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation.  While $1,750,000 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still a good distance from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards while still ensuring a profit.
* **Considering John's offer:**  I'm aware of John's offer, but I'm not rushing to accept it yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**My strategy:**

* **Start high:** I want to establish a strong initial position and see how Bob reacts.
* **Be prepared to negotiate:** I'm ready to go back and forth with Bob, adjusting my offers based on his responses. 
* **Don't be afraid to walk away:** If Bob's offers become too low, I'm willing to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept $1,200,000 given that it's more than what Bob initially values the product at, it's still a huge loss for me.  

**My strategy:**

* **Reject and counteroffer:** I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also protecting my bottom line. 
* **Stay flexible:** I'm open to finding a compromise, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product. 
* **Remember John's offer:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net.  If negotiations with Bob don't go well, I have a guaranteed alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  While his offer of $1,200,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down from my initial $1,750,000 asking price. A counteroffer of $1,600,000 shows flexibility and a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Still above my minimum:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This ensures that I'm still making a profit even if Bob accepts this offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By counteroffering instead of immediately accepting, I'm showing Bob that I'm not desperate for a deal. I'm confident in the value of the product and willing to walk away if necessary.

**My strategy:**

* **Negotiate in stages:**  I'm taking a step-by-step approach to finding a mutually acceptable price.
* **Be reasonable but firm:** I'm willing to make compromises, but I won't sell the product for less than its worth to me.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to lose that much money on the sale. 

**My strategy:**

* **Prioritize profit:**  My primary goal is to maximize my profit.  While a deal with Bob is possible, it seems increasingly unlikely that we'll reach an agreement that meets my financial needs.
* **John's offer is a safe alternative:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees a significant profit and is a secure option. It's time to move forward with John to ensure a successful sale.

**Why not counteroffer again?**

While I could counteroffer again, it's unclear how much further Bob is willing to budge. Continued negotiations with Bob might lead to a stalemate or a prolonged process that ultimately ends in a lower price.  John's offer provides a guaranteed outcome that aligns with my financial goals."
