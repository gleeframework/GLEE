Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $175. This is a starting point that's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's $150 offer, and Bob might be willing to pay a bit more since the product is worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than John's offer. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150.  This is my minimum acceptable price, as I can get the same amount from John.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, as it's still below his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price and even lower than John's offer.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation, as Bob seems unwilling to meet my expectations. It's time to sell to John and guarantee a decent profit."
