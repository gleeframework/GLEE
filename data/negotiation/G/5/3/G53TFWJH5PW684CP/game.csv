"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd be a great fit for it.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $5,000 is definitely too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm trying to keep my budget around $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gets us closer to a deal. I'm not willing to go lower, but I hope we can come to an agreement on this.",8500.0,Alice,5,
