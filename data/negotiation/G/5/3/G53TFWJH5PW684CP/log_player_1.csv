"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd be a great fit for it.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** A friendly approach can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the product's worth to Bob, potentially making him more willing to negotiate.

**Next steps:** 

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (or rejection). If he rejects, I'll try to understand his reasoning and offer a lower price if it's worth continuing the negotiation. If he accepts, great! If not, I'll keep in mind that I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Selling to John is still a better option.**  Even though I'm in the early rounds, I can still secure a much higher price by selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum value, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  However, I'll keep in mind that I have a guaranteed sale with John if the negotiations don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $5,000 is definitely too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with a compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also sticking to my minimum value.
* **Emphasize the deal:** I highlight the benefits for Bob, reminding him of the value he's getting.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly to encourage further negotiation.

**Next steps:**

* **Assess Bob's response:** I'll closely analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, great! If not, I'll consider whether to continue negotiating or sell to John. 
* **Be prepared to adjust:** Depending on Bob's response, I might need to adjust my counteroffer further, keeping in mind the goal of maximizing my earnings while potentially securing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm trying to keep my budget around $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile. 
* **Time is running out:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to start considering the value of my time.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob may not be the most efficient use of my resources.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob again, but this time I'll be more assertive and firm. I'll need to  bridge the gap between our offers quickly, or I'll need to start considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gets us closer to a deal. I'm not willing to go lower, but I hope we can come to an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concessions:** This counteroffer is a significant compromise, coming down to a price just above Bob's offer.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary.
* **Emphasizing the Value:** I'm reiterating the product's worth to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll gain from owning it.
* **Clear and Direct:** This counteroffer is clear and leaves no room for misinterpretation. I'm setting a deadline and signaling that I'm not willing to negotiate further.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:**  I'll closely analyze Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If not, I'll proceed to sell the product to John. 
* **Time is of the essence:**  I'll be mindful of the remaining rounds and act decisively to maximize my earnings."
