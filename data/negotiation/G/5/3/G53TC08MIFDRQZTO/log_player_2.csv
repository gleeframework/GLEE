"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is quite close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,200?"",
""product_price"": 8200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer lower than your true ceiling. This leaves room for Alice to counter and you to potentially meet in the middle. 
* **Not Too Low:**  While we want to save money, offering something drastically lower than Alice's asking price (like $5,000) could be seen as disrespectful and might make her less willing to negotiate. 
* **Polite & Positive:** The message maintains a polite and friendly tone, showing continued interest in the product and encouraging further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,200 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,800.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer and countering again, we can try to inch the price closer to our desired range. We're getting closer to John's price, but it's still worthwhile to try for a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That seems fair to both of us."",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a price directly in the middle of Alice's current offer ($8,800) and our previous offer ($8,200). This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal a willingness to compromise.
* **Framing as Fair:**  By suggesting this price is a ""fair"" solution, we aim to appeal to Alice's sense of finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  We're continuing the negotiation with clear and concise communication, showing Alice we're serious about purchasing the product but want to find a price that works for both of us."
