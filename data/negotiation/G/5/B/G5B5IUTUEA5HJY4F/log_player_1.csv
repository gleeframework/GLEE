"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, but still within reason. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product right away.  This will give me an idea of how much negotiating room I have."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept and get a sale quickly, I'm going to try to negotiate a better price. I'm confident that I can do better than $750,000, especially since I have John as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still reflects the product's value, and it gives us both a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm getting closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $785,000. Can we do business at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price,  $785,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to hold out for a bit more.  I still have John as a backup buyer, and I have enough rounds to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, but I'd like to add a condition. If we finalize the deal at this price, I'd like to get a 1-year warranty for the product, which is worth an additional $5,000. This way, you'll still get a good price, and I'll get a great deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Even though it's close to my minimum price, I don't want to add a warranty for $5,000.  It's not worth it to me, and I still have rounds left to negotiate a better price. I can also always sell to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable with the warranty condition.  How about we stick to the price and finalize the deal?  I'm willing to go down to $810,000, but I'd like to keep it simple and focus on the product itself.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 810000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $805,000, but I'd like to add a condition. If we finalize the deal at this price, I'd like to make a public statement on social media praising the product and your company. This could bring in more business for you and increase your visibility. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $805,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $805,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This offer is good for me. While it's just a little over my minimum price, the added publicity from Bob's social media statement could be beneficial.  I'm willing to take the risk and accept this offer."
