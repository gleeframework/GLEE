"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some middle ground.  While $10,000 is still lower than I'd prefer, I'm willing to accept $14,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above your $12,000 limit. You have a guaranteed option with John at that price, so it makes no sense to risk paying more than you need to."
