"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it!  I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice's first offer is $130. This is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $85?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's original offer, but still gives room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer (""higher than I'm willing to pay""), making it less likely Alice will simply reject it outright. 
* **Openness to compromise:** Bob indicates a willingness to find a price that works for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a price we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $130, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go any higher than $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** Bob is showing persistence and a willingness to negotiate further.
* **Reasoning:**  He provides a specific reason for his offer (""can't go any higher"") to emphasize his commitment.
* **Meeting halfway:** Bob's offer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's last offer, but still within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  At this point, it's becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to a price Bob is comfortable with.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $80, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
