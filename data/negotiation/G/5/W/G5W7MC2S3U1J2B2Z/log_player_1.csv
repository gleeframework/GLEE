""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you and believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to her product's value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000.  
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John.

By offering the product at $14,999, Alice is aiming to get the maximum price Bob might be willing to pay before refusing and going with her guaranteed sale to John."
