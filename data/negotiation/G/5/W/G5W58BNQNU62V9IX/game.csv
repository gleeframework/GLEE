"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $10,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too much for my budget. Could you meet me closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I can meet you halfway between $7,000 and $10,000, which would be $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
