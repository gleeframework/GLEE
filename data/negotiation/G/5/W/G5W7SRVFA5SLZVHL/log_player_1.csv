{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you get more than your minimum desired price.
* **It's below Bob's estimated value:**  There's room for negotiation, giving Bob a reason to accept.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can adjust your price if necessary based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still a significant discount from your initial offer.  You're in a good position to negotiate further.  

* **Potential for a higher price:**  There's still a gap between your desired price and Bob's offer. A counteroffer might lead to a compromise closer to $1,400,000.
* **You're not desperate:**  You have the safety net of selling to John for $1,200,000, so you can take a calculated risk."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the $1,375,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. I think that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.

* **Time is on your side:**  You can afford to wait and see if Bob is willing to negotiate further. 

**Next Move:**  Send Bob a counteroffer closer to your desired price, but still within a reasonable range.  You could propose $1,350,000, emphasizing the value the product offers to him."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue working towards a fair deal.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target. I'd be willing to go up to $1,320,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is only $20,000 above your minimum selling price.  While you could continue to negotiate, there are several factors influencing this decision:

* **Limited Upward Potential:** Bob's offers are consistently close to your minimum, suggesting there's little room for him to go higher.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  The negotiation is becoming tedious, and there's a real risk of reaching an impasse.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees you a profit, and you avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely.

**Conclusion:** It's better to secure the guaranteed profit with John rather than risk losing a significant amount of money or getting stuck in a lengthy negotiation with Bob."
