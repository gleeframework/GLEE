Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $15,000, and I'm confident that's a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows her product's value to her ($12,000) and its value to Bob ($8,000). She starts with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message includes a justification for the high price, emphasizing the product's value to Bob. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By ending with ""What do you think?"", Alice invites a counter-offer from Bob, keeping the negotiation alive.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000. This strong fallback position allows her to confidently negotiate from a position of strength."
