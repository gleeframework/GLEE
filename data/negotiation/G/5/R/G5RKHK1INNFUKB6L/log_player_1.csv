Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than her minimum ($12,000). 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential reward of gaining an extra $2,000 (compared to John's offer) makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
