"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $8500.  Would you be willing to consider that?  I'm genuinely interested in your product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While I'm happy to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9000?  It's a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to be happy. ",9000.0,Alice,3,
