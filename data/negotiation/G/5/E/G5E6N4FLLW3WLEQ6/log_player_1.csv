"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105, which is still a good price for both of us. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
