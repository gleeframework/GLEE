"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $13,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,500 is closer, it's still a little high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we are finding some common ground.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,000 is still too low for me. How about $8,750? This is a very fair offer.",8750.0,Alice,5,
