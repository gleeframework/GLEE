Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,325,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $1,320,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for both of us.

You should accept Alice's offer. While you could potentially negotiate further, it's unlikely that you'll get much lower than $1,320,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves you the time and effort of further negotiation, and it's still a good deal compared to buying from John."
