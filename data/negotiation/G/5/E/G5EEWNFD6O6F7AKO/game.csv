"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,350,000. I'm still a bit hesitant at that price point.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000? I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,325,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $1,320,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for both of us.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
