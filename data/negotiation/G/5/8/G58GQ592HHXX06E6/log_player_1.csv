"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible.  It's a strong opening offer but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still holding out for a better deal. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $115 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get closer to $130. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering my price to $115. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal. I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing out to John."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling to John.  I've reached a point where I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob, and I'm worried about running out of time. It's time to lock in a guaranteed profit."
