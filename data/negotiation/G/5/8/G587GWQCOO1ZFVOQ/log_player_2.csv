Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still a bit short. I'll meet you halfway again. I'll offer it to you for $73. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is very stubbornly sticking to a pattern of halving the difference.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $73, and we're running out of rounds. It's better to accept a good deal now than risk the price going back up or running out of time."
