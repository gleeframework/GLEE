"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $90 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise that still gets me a good price for the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $80?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would save me some money.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $82.50 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $81. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $81?",81.0,Alice,5,
