"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
