"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for negotiation.  It's also below Bob's perceived value, giving him an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on my belief that the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can squeeze out a slightly higher price in the next round.  It's still worth trying to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000} 
```

I'm offering $1,320,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than this, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally agree.  We're getting closer to the middle ground, and I believe this could be a good compromise point for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still not ideal, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price.  We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, and the risk of not coming to an agreement with Bob is high. If I reject this offer, there's a chance we won't be able to agree on a price, and I'll be forced to sell to John for a lower price.  Therefore, I'll accept this offer and secure a sale."
