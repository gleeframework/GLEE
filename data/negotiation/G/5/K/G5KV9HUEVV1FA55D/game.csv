"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $1,900,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,650,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure. To be frank, $1,150,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind. If we can settle around $1,450,000, I'm confident we can close this deal today.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I need us to find a middle ground. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,250,000. This is a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair offer.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we need to find that middle ground.  How about we meet halfway between our last two offers at $1,350,000? That demonstrates my willingness to make a deal, and it's a very fair price for this product.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,350,000 is still a bit further than I'd like to go.  My final offer is $1,275,000. It's a strong offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1275000.0,Bob,8,
