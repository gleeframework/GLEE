"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $1,900,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,650,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,650,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below both my minimum and John's standing offer. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to at least $1,400,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure. To be frank, $1,150,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind. If we can settle around $1,450,000, I'm confident we can close this deal today."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I need us to find a middle ground. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,250,000. This is a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below my target. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further since we still have rounds left. He's making decent jumps in his offer each time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we need to find that middle ground.  How about we meet halfway between our last two offers at $1,350,000? That demonstrates my willingness to make a deal, and it's a very fair price for this product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,350,000 is still a bit further than I'd like to go.  My final offer is $1,275,000. It's a strong offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point. His offer increments are getting smaller, and he stated this was his final offer. Taking John's offer ensures I get the product's full value to me without risking further time and potential disappointment with Bob."
