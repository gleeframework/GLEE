{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the best price possible. By offering $8,500, he's showing Alice that he's serious about buying but also demonstrating that he's willing to walk away if she doesn't meet him halfway. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that still allows for some profit for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,200 is closer to Bob's original counteroffer of $8,500.  This indicates Alice is willing to negotiate further. Bob should reject this offer and try to get a better deal by counteroffering again.  He can potentially get a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but this time he's increasing his counteroffer slightly to $8,800. This shows that he's willing to pay a bit more, but still wants to get a good deal. It's a reasonable compromise that is closer to Alice's last offer, potentially leading to a successful agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's latest offer of $9,400 is getting closer to Bob's maximum price of $10,000. However, there is a risk that Alice will continue to raise her price if Bob keeps rejecting. It's getting too close to Bob's maximum, making it more likely that Bob won't be able to get a price lower than $10,000.  To avoid further negotiation and potential overpaying, it's best for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of the price increasing further."
