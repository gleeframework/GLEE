"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  He has a clear limit of $10,000 and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to his target of $10,000. This establishes a clear negotiating range and puts pressure on Alice to make concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is closer to Bob's limit, he's still not at his ideal price.  Rejecting again shows that Bob is serious about negotiating and is not willing to settle immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal. He's increasing his offer by $1,000, showing a willingness to compromise. This puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is close to Bob's limit, he's still only $1,000 away from his target of $10,000.  Bob has shown willingness to compromise, but he's still not at his ideal price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and pressures Alice to consider a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his limit. He's increasing his offer by $500, signaling a willingness to close the deal. This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between Alice's latest offer and Bob's target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is only willing to come down to $9,500, which is still $500 more than Bob's limit.  With only three rounds remaining, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, it's the best decision to avoid further bargaining and guarantee the purchase."
