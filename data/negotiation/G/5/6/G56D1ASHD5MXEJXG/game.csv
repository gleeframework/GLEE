"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for my budget right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $5,000 for it.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway?  I can let it go for $13,500.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but $13,500 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  $7,000 is still quite low.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,000?  That's a significant discount.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,000 is closer, but I need to stay within my budget. Could we settle at $7,500? That's my final offer.",7500.0,Bob,6,
