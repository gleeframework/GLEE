Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. It's also a good starting point to gauge his interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum than $8,000, I think I can still get closer to my target price of $10,000.  I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,750. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway.  It shows I'm serious about selling to him, but also that I'm not willing to settle for his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,400 is close to my minimum of $8,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my target of $10,000, I'm at risk of losing the deal entirely and only getting $8,000 from John.  It's better to secure the sale at a slightly lower price than risk getting nothing."
