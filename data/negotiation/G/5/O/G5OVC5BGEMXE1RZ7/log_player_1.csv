Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal is beneficial for both parties is between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob immediately walks away. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can be a bit bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and your confidence in it.
* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,450,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a significant profit beyond your guaranteed sale. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob will likely counter-offer. Be ready to justify your price and potentially come down slightly.
* **Don't Reveal Your Backup:** Never let Bob know you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000. It weakens your negotiating position."
