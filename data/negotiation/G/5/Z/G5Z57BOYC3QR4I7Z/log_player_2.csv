"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. It's closer to her own valuation than yours. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($60 vs. $100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her flexibility. 
* **Aiming for the Middle Ground:** My ideal price is much lower than Alice's. By starting low, I'm aiming to eventually settle somewhere in the middle, closer to my budget of $80.
* **Polite and Positive:**  Maintaining a friendly tone is important to encourage a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is meeting me closer to the middle ground, which is good. However, $85 is still above my maximum budget. I'll try negotiating one more time to see if I can get it closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $85 is closer, but I'm trying to keep it under $80.  Would you be willing to meet me at $75?"", 
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but just slightly, to show Alice I'm willing to move but need her to do the same. 
* **Staying Firm:** I'm staying firm on my desired price range. Going to $75 keeps me below my $80 limit while still potentially leaving room for one final round of negotiation.
* **Deadline Implied:** By not jumping at $85, I'm subtly implying I might consider John's offer if we can't reach a deal soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $80? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.

Alice has met my maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting and potentially losing the deal. This is the best possible outcome from the negotiation."
