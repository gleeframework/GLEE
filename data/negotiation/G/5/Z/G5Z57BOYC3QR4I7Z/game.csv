"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $85 is closer, but I'm trying to keep it under $80.  Would you be willing to meet me at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $80? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",80.0,Alice,5,
