Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $230. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 230}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $230 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob.  I understand your budget, but $120 is quite low for what I can offer. Could you meet me halfway at $175?"", ""product_price"": 175}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $140, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a good outcome for Alice, as it's above her minimum acceptable price.  While she could push for more, there's a risk Bob might walk away.  Taking the $140 now guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale."
