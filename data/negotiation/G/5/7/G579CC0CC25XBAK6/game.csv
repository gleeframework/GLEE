"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to both of us, and I believe it could greatly benefit your needs. Let's work together to find a fair price that works for both parties. Would you consider purchasing it for $75?",75.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. How about we aim for a price of $70? This still allows us to share the value of the product while staying within your budget constraints.",70.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your revised offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $67? I think that's a fair compromise.",67.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering the value of the product and aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement, how about we set the price at $68? This is a slight increase from your last offer and maintains a fair balance.",68.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $68. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we try $66? I think that's as low as I can go and still feel good about the deal.",66.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. After careful consideration, I believe we can reach a satisfactory agreement. How about we settle on $67 as the price for the product? This is a small increase from your last offer and reflects the value of the product.",67.0,Alice,7,
