Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $110 is higher than Bob's $80 valuation, but not so high that he'll immediately reject it.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, you have room to lower the price a bit while still making a profit. 
* **It's close to your minimum:**  If Bob rejects and you go to John, you'll only be losing $10. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is better than Bob's initial valuation and gets you closer to your minimum, it's still significantly less than what you could get from John. By rejecting this offer, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Show Bob that you're serious about getting a better price.
* **Potentially increase Bob's offer:**  If Bob wants the product, he might be willing to come up slightly from his $95 counter-offer. 
* **Always have the John option:**  You can still sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail.

Let's see what counter-offer you can make to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is the lowest I can go.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your last offer and Bob's.  It shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying above your minimum. 
* **Reasoning:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and the fair return you're seeking.
* **Potential Outcome:**  It's possible Bob will accept at this price, or counter again with an offer closer to $105. 

Let's see what Bob's next move is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. I would like to propose $100 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is still $20 less than what John is offering, it's a reasonable compromise at this point.  Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best decision:

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in a higher price, but it also carries the risk of him walking away or you needing to settle for less.
* **Time Factor:**  Negotiations take time, and you're already several rounds in. Selling to Bob now ensures a sale and avoids potential delays. 
* **Profit Margin:**  $100 is still above your minimum of $120, meaning you'll make a profit.

By accepting Bob's offer, you minimize the risk of a negotiation breakdown and ensure a sale with a decent profit margin."
