"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Margin:**  This offer is significantly higher than my minimum value, giving me room to drop the price if necessary.
* **Testing the Waters:**  The first round is about getting a sense of Bob's willingness to pay and his bargaining style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  While $1,200,000 from John is a solid option, I believe there's room for negotiation with Bob. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from the initial offer but still staying above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By lowering the price, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value Met:** Bob's offer finally meets my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Time is of the Essence:**  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee of a higher offer from Bob, and I'm running out of rounds.
* **Equal Value:**  Selling to Bob at this price is equivalent to selling to John, so I'm choosing to close the deal."
