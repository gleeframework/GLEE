Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but lower than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, while still potentially securing a good profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider $8,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to make sure I get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to $9,500. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $9,000 as the price for the product. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price,  $9,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, and accepting his offer will save time and effort compared to further negotiation."
