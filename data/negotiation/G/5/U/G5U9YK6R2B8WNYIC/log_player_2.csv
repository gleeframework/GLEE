"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I'm willing to listen to your thoughts and work together to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($900,000 vs. $1,200,000).  There's a lot of room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get closer to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get closer to $1,000,000, but I'm still not willing to go that high. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm open to further negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved up from $900,000 to $950,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000.  Another round of counteroffers might get us there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too far from what I can do right now. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000?  This seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your proposal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $975,000 minus 2% discount, which would be $950,500. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm open to further negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, the 2% discount on $975,000 is a little insulting.  It's only a $250 reduction from her previous offer, and I still have a few rounds to negotiate. I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to find a way to meet in the middle, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $965,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations.  Let's try to seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 965000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $960,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm open to further negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $960,000, which is only $5,000 less than my last counteroffer of $965,000. We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and while I could try to negotiate further, it's getting close to the point where the time and effort involved in getting a few thousand dollars more might not be worth it.  

At this price, I'm saving $240,000 compared to buying from John, which is a substantial amount.  I'm going to accept the offer."
