Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for what it offers."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding my minimum ($100).
* **Strategic Pricing:** $99 is a common psychological pricing tactic. It seems like a ""deal"" compared to a round $100 and might entice Bob. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for my minimum acceptable price."
