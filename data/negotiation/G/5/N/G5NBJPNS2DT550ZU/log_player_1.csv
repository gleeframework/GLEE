Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.  This is a substantial opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a wise investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to continue exploring options with Bob. Selling to John at this point would mean losing out on potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I value your proposition, I'm unable to accept $900,000.  The value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,200,000. This price still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it presents a good opportunity for both of us.  Please consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has significant value, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000 for the product. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and closer to my desired price than John's offer. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a deal that is within my acceptable range and potentially allows for further negotiation in future rounds."
