"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I value your proposition, I'm unable to accept $900000.  The value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1200000. This price still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it presents a good opportunity for both of us.  Please consider this offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
