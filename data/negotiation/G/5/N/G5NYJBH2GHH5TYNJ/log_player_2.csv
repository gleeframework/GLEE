"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $10,000 is still a bit more than Bob is willing to pay, so it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a good strategy as it shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  The $8,500 offer is still above Alice's minimum of $8,000, so there's room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low right now.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $9,250 is still above Bob's desired price point. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will go lower. There are still several rounds left and Bob can always buy from John if he doesn't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with his strategy of offering a lower price, but this time he's getting closer to Alice's last offer.  He's also putting a bit more pressure on her by stating it's a fair price for both of them and suggesting closing the deal. This could help encourage Alice to accept the offer."
