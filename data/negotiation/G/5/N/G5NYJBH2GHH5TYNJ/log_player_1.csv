"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price that's a little higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to come up to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is more than John's offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $8,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low right now.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm offering a price that's still significantly higher than John's offer, but it shows some flexibility and encourages further negotiations.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and come closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is above my minimum desired price of $8,000, and with limited rounds remaining, it's a good deal.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
