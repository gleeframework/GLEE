Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $20,000 is way above my budget for this product. I'm really interested, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $12,000.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept it.

Bob is holding firm at $12,000, which is too far below my minimum. It's not worth my time to continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed offer for $15,000 from John."
