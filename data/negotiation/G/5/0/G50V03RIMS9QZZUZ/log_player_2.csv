You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is way too high.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise.

While $17,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get the price closer to his target."
