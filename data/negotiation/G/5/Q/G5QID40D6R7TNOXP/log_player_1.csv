{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, considering it's worth at least $120 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone by highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I could continue negotiating, it seems like we are far apart in our valuations. Since I can get my minimum price from John, it's better to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
