"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My asking price is $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the potential you see in it. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have an alternative option with John for $1,500,000.  There's a chance you can get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down.  Even if she doesn't budge, you're still covered by John's offer."
