The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $90. This is a good deal, but you can likely get it for even less. Let's see if we can negotiate further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering Alice $80. This is still a good deal for her since she values the product at $120, and it gives us some room to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to push for a higher price. While $97.5 is still a good deal compared to John's offer, I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price. There are still several rounds left to negotiate, and I'm confident we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87.5}
``` 

I'm going to meet Alice halfway by offering $87.5. This is a fair compromise considering the back and forth between our offers, and hopefully, we can finally reach an agreement."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to get as close as possible to her desired price. While $96 is still a good deal for me, I'm not ready to give in just yet. There are still a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can get her down to my last offer of $87.5."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88.5}
```

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.5.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, and there's only one round left.  While $95.5 is still a bit higher than I'd like, I'm going to accept it. It's still a good deal compared to buying from John, and it's better than risking going another round and possibly having to pay even more."
