"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations. My initial price is $1,200,000. This reflects the true worth of the product, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000. This reflects a substantial discount from my original price and leaves room for both of us to achieve a satisfactory outcome.  Let's keep the conversation going.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and our negotiation so far.",950000.0,Bob,4,
