"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $100. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a significant mark-up from my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price that is beneficial for both of us.  It's important to start high to maximize my potential profit, while still being within a reasonable range for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $95, but that's my final offer.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm countering with $95.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still leaving room to profit.  I'm framing it as my final offer to put pressure on Bob and encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $95 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, $92.50 is significantly better than selling to John for $80.  We're close to the middle ground, and it seems like Bob is serious about closing the deal."
