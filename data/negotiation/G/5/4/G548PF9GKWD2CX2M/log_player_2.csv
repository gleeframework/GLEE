"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $100. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  The product is worth $120 to Bob, so he has room to negotiate.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $100 is still a bit high for Bob, given his maximum value. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:** Bob has the advantage in this scenario because he can walk away and buy from John. This means he can pressure Alice to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  A $10 reduction from Alice's offer shows Bob is serious about buying but is also willing to negotiate. 
* **Staying Within Value:** $90 is still within Bob's maximum value, leaving some room for potential further negotiation if needed.
* **Maintaining a Balanced Approach:** This counteroffer is a good starting point for the negotiation, striking a balance between being firm on price and showing a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $95, but that's my final offer.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's Offer:** While $95 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:**  Bob still has the option to buy from John, giving him leverage to potentially get a lower price from Alice.

Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can push Alice lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $95 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Bob is proposing a price that is halfway between his previous offer of $90 and Alice's current offer of $95. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  Bob is not simply rejecting Alice's offer and making a new one. He is trying to reach a middle ground, suggesting a collaborative approach.
* **Setting a Clear Deadline:**  The statement ""I'm confident we can close the deal"" hints at a potential deadline for Alice to consider the offer. This adds a bit of pressure."
