Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it's worth the price."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good strategy to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response will tell you a lot about how much he values the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer at $120, so there's little risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob."
