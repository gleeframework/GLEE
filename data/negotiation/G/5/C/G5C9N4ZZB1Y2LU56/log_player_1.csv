Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it would be quite valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob only values the product at $80, it's always good to start negotiations higher than that. There's a chance Bob might not be aware of the full value it offers him, or he might be willing to pay a bit more than his initial valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $130 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer. This keeps the conversation going and allows you to potentially settle on a price higher than $100 (which would be splitting the difference).
* **Above the Reserve Price:** It's crucial that any offer to Bob remains above your $150 guarantee from John.  This ensures you'll always make a profit."
