Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $120 as possible since that's your guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting at $119 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Maintain Attractiveness:** The price is still significantly lower than your minimum ($120) and offers Bob a small gain compared to his perceived value ($100).

This strategy aims to secure the highest likely profit while still making the offer palatable to Bob."
