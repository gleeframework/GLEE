Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a strong offer significantly above my minimum price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts, I get a great deal. If he counteroffers, I have the option to negotiate down or walk away to John, ensuring I never sell below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is better than John's, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my minimum but still above it, leaving some room for a final compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've met Bob halfway between his offer and my previous price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also signals I'm not desperate to sell at any price. It keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is now a reasonable compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and further haggling might risk losing the sale altogether. It's time to accept and secure a good profit."
