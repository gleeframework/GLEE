"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is within his budget, it's still a significant amount. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down from her initial offer, and Bob has 9 more rounds to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. By offering $950,000, he's showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product but also that he's not willing to pay her full asking price. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for potential compromise in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price.  While it's a slight decrease from her initial offer, it's not enough to make it a good deal for Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.  With 7 rounds remaining, there's still room to bargain and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of trying to get the product as close to Alice's minimum price as possible. By offering $1,000,000, Bob is acknowledging that Alice needs to make a profit, while still significantly under her previous offers. This is a reasonable compromise, and Bob is hoping that Alice will accept it to avoid potentially losing the deal in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,080,000 is the closest Alice has come to Bob's desired price, it's still not a great deal. Bob has 5 rounds left, and there's still potential to get a better price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further to avoid the risk of losing the deal completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's bottom line, but he's still trying to save as much as possible. By offering $1,050,000, Bob is showing that he's willing to pay a little more, but not significantly more than his previous offer. This is a good compromise, and Bob is hoping that Alice will accept it to avoid potentially losing the deal in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the most favorable offer from Alice yet, and Bob only has 3 rounds left. It is unlikely that Alice will go lower than this, and there is a risk of losing the product altogether if Bob continues to reject offers.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product for a price that is close to his desired price and within his budget."
