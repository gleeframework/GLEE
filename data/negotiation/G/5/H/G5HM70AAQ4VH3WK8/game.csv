"Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product is very interesting, but I'm not quite ready to commit to your price.  I'd like to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but let's aim for something closer to the middle ground. I'm proposing $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a more agreeable price. How about $875,000? It's a good compromise, and it allows us both to make a worthwhile deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 isn't quite there yet for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $887,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while also allowing me to realize a good return on my investment. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us.",887500.0,Alice,5,
