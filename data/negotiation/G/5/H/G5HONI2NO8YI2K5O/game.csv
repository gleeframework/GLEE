"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $900,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.
