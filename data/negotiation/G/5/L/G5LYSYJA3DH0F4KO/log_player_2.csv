# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects its worth while also recognizing your interest.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the $900,000 offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and represents the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.
