"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and open to negotiation. 
* **Not Too High:**  $150 is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum is $100.  It's likely Bob won't immediately accept, but it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  $100 is my minimum value, and I can get that from John.  
* **Negotiation Room:**  Bob's offer is my minimum, which means there's no room for me to make a profit if I accept now.
* **Opportunity to Improve:** By rejecting, I can explore if Bob is willing to pay more in future rounds. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try and get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price.  Would you consider $125? That would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our initial offers. 
* **Reasonable Value:** $125 is still significantly more than my minimum and offers some profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:**  $112.50 is above my minimum of $100, so I would make a profit.
* **Progress:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Bob will come up further, and there's a chance he might walk away.  Accepting his offer is a good way to secure a decent profit."
