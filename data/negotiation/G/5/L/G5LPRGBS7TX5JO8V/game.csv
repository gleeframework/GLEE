"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but based on my research and needs, I am not able to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the original price I had in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $1800000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable considering the value I bring to the table. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
