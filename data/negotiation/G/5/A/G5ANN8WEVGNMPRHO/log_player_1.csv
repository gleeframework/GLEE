This is a tough decision!  We're down to the wire, and Bob is not budging much.  While $8,800 is a good price, I'm not sure we can get much higher in this round. Since it's getting late, I think it's best to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000.  I'd rather secure a sale than risk losing the deal completely."
