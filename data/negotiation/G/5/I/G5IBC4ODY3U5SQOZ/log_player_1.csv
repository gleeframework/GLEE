I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts before considering going lower or selling to John."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}

I'm going to counter with $9,750. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I hope this will be agreeable to him, but I'm still prepared to accept the $8,000 offer from John if necessary."

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'm going to accept his offer."
