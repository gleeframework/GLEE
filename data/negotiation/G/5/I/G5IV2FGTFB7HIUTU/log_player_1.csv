Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $1,200,000, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit lower to secure a sale.
* **Bob's value:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  This means there's a potential for a deal where we both benefit.
* **First offer:**  $1,000,000 is a starting point that's above Bob's value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.

**Important Note:** This strategy relies on the assumption that Bob is motivated to purchase the product and is willing to negotiate. If Bob is unwilling to budge, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $850000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he is showing interest in the product, suggesting there's room for negotiation. 
* **Better deal with John:**  I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.

**Next steps:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer, trying to find a price that's both agreeable to Bob and closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm aiming for a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  $925,000 is still above Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **Signaling flexibility:**  By coming down from my previous offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, encouraging Bob to meet me halfway. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** This offer still allows me to sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $875000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is still significantly lower than my desired minimum of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiating room:**  While Bob is inching closer, there's still room for negotiation.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always secure a better price by selling to John for $1,200,000.

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob again, attempting to reach a price that's closer to my desired value while remaining open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  How about we meet in the middle again?  I'm willing to drop to $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again offering a middle ground, this time between my previous offer of $925,000 and Bob's offer of $875,000. 
* **Closing the gap:** This move shows a genuine attempt to reach an agreement while still staying above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Maintaining my minimum:** $900,000 is closer to my desired minimum than Bob's offer, but still allows for some flexibility. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** Highlighting the ""fairness"" of the offer might appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I am likely to accept his offer of $875,000 in the next round.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's a better deal than selling to John for $1,200,000 and then paying for transportation and any other potential expenses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer of $850,000 is his highest offer yet, but it's still significantly below my minimum.  
* **No further leverage:**  I've already made significant compromises and am unlikely to get a higher offer from Bob.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I reach my minimum and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob. 

**Conclusion:**  While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, it's more strategically sound to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed deal."
