"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to pay $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $110, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $115. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",115.0,Alice,5,
