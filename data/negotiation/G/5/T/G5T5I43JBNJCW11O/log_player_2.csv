You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Since Alice is offering the product for $120, which is your maximum budget, there's no incentive to negotiate.  Buying from John immediately is the best option as it guarantees you the product at your price limit."
