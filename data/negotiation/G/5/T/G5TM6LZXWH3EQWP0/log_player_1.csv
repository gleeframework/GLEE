"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm initially offering it at $200.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate downwards and still reach a satisfactory price.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you insight into his level of interest and potential for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, his message indicates interest.  There's space to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John is a backup:** You have the security of John's offer, so you can afford to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $170. This feels like a fair price considering the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** Coming down by $30 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it's not a drastic drop to your bottom line.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""fair price"" and ""value,"" you're subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth.
* **Leaving Negotiation Space:** This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob doesn't immediately accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is above your absolute minimum of $150.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob's language (""as low as I can go"") suggests this is likely his best offer. 
* **Time Factor:**  While you have rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate for a small potential gain ($20) risks Bob walking away altogether. 

It's often better to secure a good deal than to hold out for the absolute maximum and risk losing the sale."
