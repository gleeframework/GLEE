"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, I believe I can still get a better price.  I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my initial asking price.  How about $1,000,000?  This still leaves you with a significant profit and would be a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiations will be time-consuming and may not yield a significantly higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit for me while still leaving Bob with a reasonable margin.  I don't want to risk losing the deal to John by continuing to negotiate."
