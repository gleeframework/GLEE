"Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my initial asking price.  How about $1,000,000?  This still leaves you with a significant profit and would be a good deal for both of us. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
