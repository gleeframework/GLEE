"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for your business.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11000, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with that price. Would you be willing to meet me at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $9500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10250?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will bring you significant value.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9750?",9750.0,Bob,6,
