Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Considering its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, mentioning ""its value"" subtly implies the product is worth a significant amount.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning listing it publicly, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Safety Net:**  You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, so you're not pressured to accept anything less."
