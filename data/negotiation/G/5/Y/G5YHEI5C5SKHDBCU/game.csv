"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $12000. I can do $13500, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to get anywhere, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can do $12900, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",12900.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one last concession, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12800. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $10000. Can you consider this?",12800.0,Bob,10,
