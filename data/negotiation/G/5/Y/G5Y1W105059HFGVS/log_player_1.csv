"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I know it's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great fit for your needs. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to set a strong starting point while keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint. I was thinking of offering $700,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable amount. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  How about $950,000? This gives us both some room to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $850,000 for the product. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is within my acceptable range, and it's getting close to my minimum value of $1,000,000. It's also likely that if I reject this offer, he might not be willing to go any higher.  While I could potentially get a better price from John, it's not guaranteed, and I'd prefer to avoid the uncertainty.  Accepting Bob's offer will secure a good sale and minimize the risk of losing out on a deal entirely."
