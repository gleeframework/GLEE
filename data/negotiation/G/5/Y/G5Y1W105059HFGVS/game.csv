"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint. I was thinking of offering $700,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  How about $950,000? This gives us both some room to negotiate.",950000.0,Alice,3,
