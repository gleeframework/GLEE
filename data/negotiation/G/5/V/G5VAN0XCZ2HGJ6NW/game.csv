"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my bottom line. Let's find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to try to meet you in the middle again. How about $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go any lower than $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a final offer of $8,500. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'd be happy to make a deal. If not, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $8,000.",8500.0,Bob,6,
