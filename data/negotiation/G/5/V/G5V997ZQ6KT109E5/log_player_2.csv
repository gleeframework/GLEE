"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a lower price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a lower price quickly. This initial offer is likely to be rejected by Alice, but it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation.  This also tests Alice's willingness to negotiate and provides a starting point for the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer, but it's still higher than Bob's desired price. There's room for further negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal. The opportunity cost of rejecting the offer is minimal since Bob can still purchase from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer to $1,000,000. This is the maximum price he's willing to pay, as he can purchase from John for this price. By offering $1,000,000, Bob is signaling his commitment to a fair deal while leaving room for Alice to potentially make a slight concession to finalize the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has reduced her price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Given the limited number of rounds remaining (only 5 left), and the fact that Bob can get the product from John at his maximum price, it makes more sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice. The potential savings by continuing with Alice are outweighed by the risk of failing to reach an agreement and being left without the product."
