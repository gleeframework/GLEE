"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $8000? I'm very interested in the product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is at or below my minimum acceptable price, I'll choose option 1.
