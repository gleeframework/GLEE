"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but $10500 is my absolute bottom line. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $9750. Let me know if you're willing to go that far.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I can't go as low as $9750, I'm willing to meet you at $10000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $9900, which is very close to your offer and hopefully a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to that.",9900.0,Bob,6,
