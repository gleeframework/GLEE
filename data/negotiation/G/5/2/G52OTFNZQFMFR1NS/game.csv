"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $9000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than $9000. How about $8500? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",8500.0,Bob,4,
