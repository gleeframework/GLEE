"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $125.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $125 is still a bit too steep for me. Could we possibly meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $100? That would be a price I'm comfortable with.",100.0,Bob,4,
