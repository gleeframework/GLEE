Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $125.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $125 is still a bit too steep for me. Could we possibly meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $100? That would be a price I'm comfortable with.
