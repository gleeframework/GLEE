"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that. How about we split the difference and meet at $12500? I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $11000. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11000 is still below my minimum.  Let's try to meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $11500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet at $11250? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to pay a premium for the product if it's really worth it.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11250 is getting closer, I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $11400. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",11400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11400 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11250 and $11400. How about we try $11325? It's a compromise that I'm willing to make, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",11325.0,Bob,8,
