"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but not so high that Bob will instantly reject it. It's a good starting point to see where Bob stands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it shows interest, it's not a serious offer. I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that. How about we split the difference and meet at $12,500? I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $11000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than my product's value. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's try to meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet at $11250? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to pay a premium for the product if it's really worth it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,250 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, it's still below my desired range. With only 4 rounds remaining, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11,250 is getting closer, I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $11,400. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11400 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11250 and $11400. How about we try $11325? It's a compromise that I'm willing to make, and I hope we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,325. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,325
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,325 is still below my desired price, but with only two rounds left, I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  It's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  It's a good deal, and I'll accept it."
