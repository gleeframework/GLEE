"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. You'll be getting a great deal, and I'll still be able to make a good profit. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can save a considerable amount of money ($300,000) by going with John."
