"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

It's better to try and get a better price from Alice.  You can likely negotiate a lower price, as she is willing to sell for less than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still above your maximum budget, leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now within my budget, and it's likely that further negotiation won't bring the price down significantly further. It's better to accept the offer and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer, potentially leading to a higher price or a complete breakdown of the negotiation."
