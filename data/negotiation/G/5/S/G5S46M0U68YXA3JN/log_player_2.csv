"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still gives you a significant profit margin. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? It's a fair price that allows me a decent profit margin."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  $900,000 is my absolute minimum.  This still gives you a substantial profit margin, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's reach a deal now, as I'm running out of time for this negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above your alternative option of buying from John for $800,000.  There's no guarantee she'll go lower than $850,000, and continuing the negotiation risks getting a worse deal or missing out on John's offer entirely."
