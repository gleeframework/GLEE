``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $1,000,000 but also leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects this, I can adjust the price based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind my fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's above my minimum price, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to him.  I will reject his offer and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still represents a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1250000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than I would like, but it's getting closer to my desired price.  At this point, I'm willing to accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale.  While $1,250,000 is less than the product's value to him, it's still a significant profit for me and a better outcome than selling to John."
