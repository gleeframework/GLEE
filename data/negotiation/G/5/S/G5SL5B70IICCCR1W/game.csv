"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I value our discussions and believe you would benefit greatly from this product.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is a firm price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  Given my budget and the fact you have another buyer, I'm going to have to decline your offer.  Thanks for your time.",0.0,Bob,6,
