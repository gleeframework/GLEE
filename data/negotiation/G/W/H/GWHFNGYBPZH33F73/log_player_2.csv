"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds significant value to both of us. Given its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I am offering you the chance to purchase this product for $1,350,000. This price reflects a fair assessment of the product's worth while allowing for a reasonable profit on my end. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal and hope to facilitate a transaction that meets our respective needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,500,000. There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or get the product for your maximum budget from John."
