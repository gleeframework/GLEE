"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer and demonstrates my desire to work with you.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 still doesn't quite work for me. Let's split the difference and go with $975,000. This is a very fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round.",975000.0,Alice,5,
