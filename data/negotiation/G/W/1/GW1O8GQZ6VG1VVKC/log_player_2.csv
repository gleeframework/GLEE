"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what it can do for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to send a clear message that we're looking for a price significantly lower.  We have plenty of rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be priced much closer to its market value. I'm willing to offer $900,000."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective on the market value, this product offers unique advantages that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the long-term benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down a bit, but her offer is still way above our budget. We need to signal that we're serious about a much lower price point without scaring her off completely.  Let's see if we can get her to engage more seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2,000,000 is still far beyond what I can justify. I'm serious about buying this product, but it needs to be within a realistic range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  Let me know if you're open to working within this range."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase and I respect your approach to negotiation. Let's find a middle ground.  I can come down to $1,700,000.  This offer takes into account the value it offers and represents a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is finally moving in the right direction, but the price is still too high. We need to make it clear that we are getting close to John's offer. Let's keep negotiating, but keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. Your willingness to compromise is good, but we still have a significant gap to bridge. I'm willing to come up to $1,250,000. This is a strong offer on my end, and I think it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is my final offer, as it's the lowest I can go while still reflecting the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

This is a tough one, but it's time to walk away. Alice is  holding firm at $1,550,000, and even though she calls it a ""final offer,"" there's no guarantee she won't come down a bit in a later round. However, her movement has been slow, and the difference between her offer and John's price is too significant. Taking John's offer at $800,000 makes more financial sense at this point than risking further negotiation for a potentially minimal gain."
