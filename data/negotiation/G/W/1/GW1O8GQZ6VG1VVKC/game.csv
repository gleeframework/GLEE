"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be priced much closer to its market value. I'm willing to offer $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective on the market value, this product offers unique advantages that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the long-term benefits it will bring to your business.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2,000,000 is still far beyond what I can justify. I'm serious about buying this product, but it needs to be within a realistic range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  Let me know if you're open to working within this range.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
