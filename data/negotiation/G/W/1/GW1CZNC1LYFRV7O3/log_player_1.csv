{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $125.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, and I'm hoping to get close to my minimum of $150. By starting at $125, I'm leaving room for negotiation but still making a profit. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm hoping to find a better deal. Can you consider selling it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I appreciate your interest! However, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $110 as my offer for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $110 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum of $150.  I'm confident I can make a better deal with another buyer in the future. It's better to take this offer than risk losing Bob entirely and having to start fresh with a new buyer."
