"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000. Would that be feasible?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
