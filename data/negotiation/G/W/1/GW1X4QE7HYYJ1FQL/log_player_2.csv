"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice's first offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.

Alice is coming down, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'll counteroffer again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now. It's unlikely I'll get a significantly better price without risking her accepting John's offer.  $1,025,000 is a good deal."
