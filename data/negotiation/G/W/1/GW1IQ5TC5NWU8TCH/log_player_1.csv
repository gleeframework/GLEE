Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $140 is my initial asking price, I could meet you halfway at $125.  It's a final offer, and I'm confident you won't find this value elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

You have three options:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. John offers a guaranteed $120, which meets my needs."
