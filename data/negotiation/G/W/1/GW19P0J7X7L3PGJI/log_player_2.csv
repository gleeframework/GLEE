Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, based on the current market conditions and the value proposition of our product, I am unable to accept your offer at $850,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $900,000. This still represents a significant profit for us while considering your budget constraints. I hope this proposal aligns better with your financial plans.
