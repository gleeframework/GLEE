"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. It's something you value at $100, and I'm offering it to you for $90.  This is a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $90 is less than your maximum budget of $100 and also saves you money compared to buying from John for $100."
