"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $15,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $16,500. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $16,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still only able to offer $15,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my financial limitations. Let's meet in the middle.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to add a bit more to the price. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $16,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,5,
