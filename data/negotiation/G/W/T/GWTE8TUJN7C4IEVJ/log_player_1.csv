Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $120. Offering it at $100 gives Bob a good deal (saving $20) while still allowing you to make a significant profit above your minimum ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a slightly lower price. 
* **Avoiding a Lost Sale:** Offering a price too close to $120 might discourage Bob, leading him to reject the offer. This strategy aims to secure the sale with a price beneficial to both parties."
