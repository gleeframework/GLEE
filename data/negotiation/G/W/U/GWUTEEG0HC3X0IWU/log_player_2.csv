"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is above his budget, and he can get a better deal from John or by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He's starting low to see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly. He knows he can always get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's room to push for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice or by buying from John. There's still room to push for a lower price, and he has time to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to negotiate but still trying to stay below his $12,000 limit. This is a compromise that could entice Alice to accept, while still keeping him in a good negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer.  While $13,500 is very close to his limit, he still has a good chance of getting it for cheaper. There are 5 rounds left, and Alice has shown willingness to negotiate. This is a good opportunity to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but still trying to save some money. He's raising his offer again, demonstrating his seriousness about buying the product, while still pushing for a good deal. If Alice rejects this offer, he might be forced to buy from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  It's within his budget and only $1,000 more than what he could get from John. With only 3 rounds remaining, there's a risk Alice won't budge further and he'll be stuck buying from John at a higher price. This is a reasonable compromise to secure the product."
