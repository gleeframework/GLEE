Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, knowing that Bob's value is unknown. I'm leaving room for negotiation but also setting a clear expectation that the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value might be high for you, but I believe I can offer you $130 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm not convinced it's the best I can get. I'll try to counter and see if I can get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While $130 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $140? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $140. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my initial asking price and above my minimum threshold. Accepting this offer would be the most profitable choice at this point."
