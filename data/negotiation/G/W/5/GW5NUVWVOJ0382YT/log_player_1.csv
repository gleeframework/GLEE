Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $135, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and suggests the product is valuable to Bob, encouraging a positive response. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open.
* **John as a Backup:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $150, so I'm not desperate and can afford to be somewhat flexible with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even below Bob's own perceived value of $120. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's counteroffer is too low, it shows his interest. There's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have the option to sell to John for $150 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's low offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $100 is too far below what I'm able to offer this product for. How about we meet in the middle at $115?  It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $115 is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while remaining above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I highlight that $115 is still a good deal for Bob, appealing to his interest in getting a good price.
* **Staying Firm:**  I avoid dropping too low, keeping in mind my minimum price and the possibility of selling to John."
