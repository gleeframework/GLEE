"I understand that $10000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6000. How about we meet in the middle at $8000? I'm confident you'll love the product and it's worth it to you.",8000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $7800, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we try $7900? It's a small increase, but it's still a great deal for you.",7900.0,Alice,7,
