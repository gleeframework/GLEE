"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a significant discount, given its value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's the best I can do at this point. Let me know if you're interested.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle, but $775,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to drop my price further to $825,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Please consider my offer carefully.",825000.0,Alice,5,
