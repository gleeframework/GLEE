"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's more than my minimum price of $100 and leaves room for negotiation.  It's also less than Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my ideal selling price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm countering with $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is only $2 away from my minimum price of $100, and it's only $2 less than what I was willing to accept in the previous round.  At this point, I'm confident that I'm unlikely to get a better offer, and I would rather not risk further rounds by rejecting his offer.  Selling to John for $100 would be worse."
