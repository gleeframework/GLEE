"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is within his budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $105, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $115.  This aggressive counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to negotiate. While this might be a bit too low for Alice, it's a starting point for a negotiation.  If Alice rejects, Bob can adjust his counteroffer in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's target, it's still more than he wants to pay.  He's already shown he's willing to negotiate, and Alice has shown some flexibility. Bob can continue to try and get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counteroffering again.  There are still several rounds left, and a small decrease in price could save him a significant amount of money in the long run."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise.  Offering $108 is a reasonable middle ground, considering Alice's latest offer of $110 and Bob's previous offer of $105. This could be the sweet spot to reach an agreement in the next round."
