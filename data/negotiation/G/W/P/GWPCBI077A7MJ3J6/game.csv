"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Could you do $11,000? That would make it worthwhile for me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  $11,000 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about $10,500 as my final offer? ",10500.0,Alice,5,
