"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can still get the product for cheaper than John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $8,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,800. This is still a great price considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Even though Alice has come down in price, it's still worth trying to negotiate a bit lower. You are still getting a good deal at $8,800, but you can potentially save even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $8,800. How about $8,600? That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,600 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has already lowered her price significantly and is now offering a price that is below your maximum acceptable value. It's a good deal to accept and avoid further negotiation risks."
