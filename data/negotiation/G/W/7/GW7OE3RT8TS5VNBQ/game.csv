"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $140 right now.",140.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,160.0
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession by lowering the price from $180 to $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $155.",155.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $155 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and meet at $152.50. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",152.5,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,157.5
"I see you're trying to negotiate, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $152.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. I can offer it to you for $157.50, which is the midpoint between $155 and $160. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",157.5,Alice,5,,
