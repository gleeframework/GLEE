It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $2,000,000 when John is offering the same product for $1,500,000.  The best strategy is to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's asking price and is likely to be rejected. However, it sets the stage for a negotiation and allows me to see how flexible Alice is."

Alice's offer of $1,750,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. I'll reject her offer and try to counter with a lower price."

I'm increasing my offer to $1,250,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's price. It shows good faith and signals that I am willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still higher than John's price.  To save the most money, I'll go with John's offer."
