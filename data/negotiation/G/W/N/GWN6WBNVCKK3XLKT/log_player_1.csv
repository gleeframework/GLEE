Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This is a starting offer that is significantly higher than Bob's estimated value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good balance between maximizing profit and keeping the negotiation open.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a lot of money, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. It's worth pushing for a bit more, as I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if this negotiation falls apart.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to lower my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. It's worth pushing for a slightly higher price, and if that doesn't work, I can always sell to John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm going to make one final counteroffer to Bob. This is a slight increase from his last offer, but it's still within a reasonable range and closer to my minimum acceptable price.  If he rejects this, I'll move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the point where I'm no longer comfortable with the negotiations with Bob. His offers are simply too low. I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John for a much better price."
