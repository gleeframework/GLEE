"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:** A positive message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Open ended question:**  This invites Bob to respond and gives him the chance to express his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close but not ideal:**  While $130 is above my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to try for a better price. 
* **Avoiding selling to John:** I'm confident I can get a better deal than $120 from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about $140?  That's still a great price for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm counter-offering with a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm staying friendly and encouraging a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $135 for the product. It's still within my budget and I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $135 is very close to my desired price range and only slightly lower than my last counteroffer. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Further negotiation might risk Bob walking away completely.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  If I need to, I can always fall back on John's offer of $120, which is my minimum."
