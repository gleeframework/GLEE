Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your persistence. However, we're not willing to go as low as $825,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is just $50,000 over my budget.  While I would prefer to get it for $800,000, the risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might walk away or increase her price again.  At this point, it's a good deal and I don't want to risk losing it."
