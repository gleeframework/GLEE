Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget limitations, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for it.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is still a bit too low for me to feel comfortable. How about we split the difference again and settle on $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, and it's the most I can afford.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my price, his final offer of $13,000 is still less than what John is offering. It's not worth the risk of Bob not budging any further.  I'll take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
