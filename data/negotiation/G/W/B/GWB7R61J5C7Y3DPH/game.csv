"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget limitations, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for it.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is still a bit too low for me to feel comfortable. How about we split the difference again and settle on $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, and it's the most I can afford.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",13000.0,Bob,6,
