{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  It's a fair price considering its potential.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($15,000) to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I mention the product's ""potential"" to subtly emphasize its worth without revealing too much. 
* **Open-ended Question:**  I ask ""What do you think?"" to encourage Bob to engage and make a counteroffer."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,500, which still reflects the value of this product. I believe this is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 17500}

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $16,000. This is a good compromise and a decent profit for me.  While I could try to squeeze a bit more, I'm concerned about the time limit and the risk of losing the deal completely. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a reasonable return."
