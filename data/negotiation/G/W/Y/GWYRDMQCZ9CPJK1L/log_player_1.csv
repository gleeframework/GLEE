Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120:** This is a starting point that is well above my minimum value ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** It's important to be polite and express the value the product offers to Bob. This increases the chances of him accepting the offer or engaging in a constructive negotiation. 
 
By offering $120, I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without immediately revealing my minimum price. This allows for a negotiation process that can potentially lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
