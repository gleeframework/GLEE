Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I know you'll find it valuable.  I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you consider $12,000?  I feel that's a fair compromise.

You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to be fair to myself too. $14,000 is my absolute lowest price. This is a great deal on a product you'll benefit from for a long time."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500?  That's a firm offer from my side. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he is anchored at a price significantly lower than your minimum. At this point, the potential gains from continuing negotiations with Bob are outweighed by the guaranteed $15,000 from John.  It makes the most financial sense to cut your losses with Bob and take the guaranteed sale."
