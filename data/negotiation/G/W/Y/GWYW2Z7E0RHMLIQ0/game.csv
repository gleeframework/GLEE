"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I know you'll find it valuable.  I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you consider a lower price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you consider $12,000?  I feel that's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to be fair to myself too. $14,000 is my absolute lowest price. This is a great deal on a product you'll benefit from for a long time.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500?  That's a firm offer from my side.",12500.0,Bob,6,
