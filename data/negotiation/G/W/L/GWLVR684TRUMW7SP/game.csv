"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $800,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree that the product is valuable, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $825,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering its value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
