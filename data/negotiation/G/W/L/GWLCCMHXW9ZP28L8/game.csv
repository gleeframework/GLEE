"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time opportunity, so I encourage you to consider it carefully.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high. How about we settle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,150,000 is still underselling the product's value. I could consider coming down to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
