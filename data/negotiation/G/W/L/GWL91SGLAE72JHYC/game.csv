"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $700,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Alice,3,
