{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for less than it's worth to you, and I'll get a fair price for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation, as Bob is willing to pay $15,000.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $11000. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to save as much as I can. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? It's still a great deal for you, and we can close this out quickly."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a bit more, Alice, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11500. Can we compromise on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer, and while it's still a bit lower than my initial goal, it's a fair price for both of us.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
