"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good offer.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
