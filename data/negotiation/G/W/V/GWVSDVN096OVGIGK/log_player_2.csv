"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his desired price. He's still got rounds left, so rejecting and counter-offering again makes sense. It also signals to Alice that he's serious about getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $925,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still above Bob's limit of $800,000. He has only 5 rounds left. It's in his best interest to secure the product at his desired price from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice that might not yield a better outcome."
