Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice knows it's worth $1,500,000 to John.  Starting with a high offer of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying closer to the higher valuation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high price without revealing Alice's guaranteed alternative with John.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion (""Let me know your thoughts""), signaling potential flexibility.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Gain:**  If Bob accepts, Alice gains significantly more than selling to John.
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The high offer allows for potential counter-offers, which could still land at a price higher than John's offer.
3. **Maintain a Positive Relationship:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, the door remains open for further discussion."
