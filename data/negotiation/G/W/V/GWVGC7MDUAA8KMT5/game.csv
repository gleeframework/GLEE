"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you consider $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $135. I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. How about $130? It's closer to your initial offer and a good price point for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to my initial offer. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $137.50. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.",137.5,Alice,5,
