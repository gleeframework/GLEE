"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is tempting, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing the negotiation. There are 9 more rounds to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $6,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 6500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer to test the waters. This price is still above his ideal target, but it's a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer.  This move demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and could potentially lead to a faster deal if Alice is open to compromising."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,900. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $6,900 is a good compromise, and Bob is getting a decent discount from his initial target of $6,500. It's still slightly above his ideal price, but there's a risk of the negotiation dragging on or Alice walking away. Accepting this offer secures the product and a reasonable price without further risk."
