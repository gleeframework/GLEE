Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low.  The value of this product to you is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $975,000 is closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a bit more. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finding a solution. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? That seems like a fair price to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, this is a good deal considering the limited rounds left.  $1,000,000 is a good profit for me, and it seems like a fair price for Bob as well.  I'm happy to close the deal now."
