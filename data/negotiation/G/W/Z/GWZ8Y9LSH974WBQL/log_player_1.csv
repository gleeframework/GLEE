"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the value of the product without revealing my minimum, encouraging Bob to consider its worth. 

This strategy aims to get the negotiation going while setting a high baseline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking for something within my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $120. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.**  While I'd like to close the deal, accepting this offer would result in a significant loss. 
* **There are still rounds remaining, and I have the option to sell to John for a better price.** This gives me leverage to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired value.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is still a great price for a product of this quality.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a smaller concession:**  I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum, showing a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my position.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation open.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $140. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.**  While it's closer, accepting it would still be a loss for me.
* **I have the option to sell to John for a better price.**  This gives me leverage to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired value.**  

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $140 is still a little below what I can accept. How about we settle on $145?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm offering a price only slightly higher than Bob's last offer, demonstrating flexibility while staying close to my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing $145 as a ""fair price"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a good rapport. 

This strategy aims to bridge the gap between our positions and potentially lead to a successful deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer of $145. I'm willing to go up to $140, which is within my budget and also reflects the value I see in the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.** While we're close, it's not worth risking further rounds of negotiation.
* **I have a guaranteed sale to John for a better price.** This offers a much more secure and profitable outcome.
* **The potential benefits of continuing with Bob are outweighed by the certainty of selling to John.**  

With only a few rounds remaining, it's wise to secure the higher price from John and avoid the risk of a deal falling through with Bob."
