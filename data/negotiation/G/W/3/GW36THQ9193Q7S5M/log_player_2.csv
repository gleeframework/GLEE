"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business or personal endeavors. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe we can come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial. I am offering the product to you at $11,000, which I think strikes a fair balance between its worth and your perceived value. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you have any concerns that we can address. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his desired price point."
