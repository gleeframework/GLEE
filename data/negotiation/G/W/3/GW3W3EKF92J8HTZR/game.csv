"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $2,000,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is considerably below what I had in mind. This product offers significant long-term value, and I'm confident it will bring you a strong return. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial in the long run.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but I need to be upfront â€“ $1,200,000 is simply too far below what I can accept.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,500,000. This represents the very lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a strong investment for you considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,500,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a good compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my financial limits.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
