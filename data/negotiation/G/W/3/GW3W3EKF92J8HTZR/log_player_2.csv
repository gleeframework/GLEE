Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $2,000,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is considerably below what I had in mind. This product offers significant long-term value, and I'm confident it will bring you a strong return. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob should continue negotiating and aim for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial in the long run."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but I need to be upfront â€“ $1,200,000 is simply too far below what I can accept.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,500,000. This represents the very lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a strong investment for you considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He should continue negotiating and try to get a lower price. There are still 5 rounds left, so there's room to try and reach a mutually acceptable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,500,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a good compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my financial limits.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
