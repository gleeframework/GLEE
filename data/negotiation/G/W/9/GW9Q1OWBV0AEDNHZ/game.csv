"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from your new offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,375,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
