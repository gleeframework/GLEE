"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to a mutually beneficial price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,080,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this point.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
