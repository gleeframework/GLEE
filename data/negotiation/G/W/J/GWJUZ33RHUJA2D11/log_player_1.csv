Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for.
