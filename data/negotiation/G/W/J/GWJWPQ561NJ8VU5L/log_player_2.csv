"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe could significantly enhance your operations and efficiency. Given its value to you, I understand it's worth $10,000 to you. Considering the product's unique features and the benefits it offers, I propose a fair price of $12,000 for this transaction. This price reflects the quality and utility of the product while allowing both parties to benefit. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you know you can get the same product from John for $10,000. Your goal is to save money, so buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
