{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a low counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount.
* This sets the stage for a negotiation. 
*  Alice knows the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, so there's room for compromise.
* If Alice rejects this offer, I can gradually increase my offer in subsequent rounds while staying within my budget."
