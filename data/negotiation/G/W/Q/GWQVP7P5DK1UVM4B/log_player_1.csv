"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how much he's willing to pay.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price."

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it significantly above Bob's offer. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell at his price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is my minimum, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting it. I've given him a good deal, and I'm confident that we can come to an agreement.  If he rejects it, I'll have to consider selling to John at that price."

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offer still below my minimum, I'm going to sell to John. It's better to secure my minimum than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price."
