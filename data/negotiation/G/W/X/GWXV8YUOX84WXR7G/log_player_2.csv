"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll be impressed by its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John for the same price ($1,200,000), there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You could potentially negotiate with Alice and try to get a lower price, but you don't have any information about her motivation for selling or how much she's willing to lower the price."
