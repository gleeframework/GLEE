Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it's  above my minimum price of $100 but still leaves some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or simply sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $120. While it's better than selling to John, it's still below my preferred price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, and hopefully, it will be more appealing to him.  I believe $130 is a fair price, considering the product's value to Bob."
