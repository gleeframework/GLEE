"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $150 from John.  You should reject Alice's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $120, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $140, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still allowing me to save money compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is a good price. It's lower than John's price of $150 and within my budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price, and I risk losing the product to John.  It's better to secure the product at a decent price than risk losing it altogether."
