"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $12,000. My revised offer is $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $13,000?  This is my final offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to push the price down, but I'm not comfortable going below $14,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. My final offer is $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,5,
