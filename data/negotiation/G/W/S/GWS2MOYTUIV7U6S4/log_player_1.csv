Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $150, offering it slightly below his perceived value increases the chance of a sale at a high price point. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is close to Bob's maximum, it leaves a small window for potential negotiation if he tries to haggle. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  It's crucial that the offer exceeds the $100 John is willing to pay, ensuring a better profit if Bob declines."
