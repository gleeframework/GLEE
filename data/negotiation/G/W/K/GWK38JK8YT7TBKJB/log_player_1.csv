Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, at $18,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but it also demonstrates my confidence in the product's value.  I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum, but I'll be ready to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is right at my minimum acceptable price, so accepting is the best choice. While I'd love to get closer to my desired $18,000, the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal to John is not worth it."
