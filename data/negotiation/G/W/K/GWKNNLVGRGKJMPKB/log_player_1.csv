{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will bring great value. I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in making a deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I have 10 rounds, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can close the deal closer to my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the value this product brings.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a profit, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $925000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to keep negotiating with him since he's showing interest, and I have rounds left to get to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $937,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 937500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $925000, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000,  I still have 4 rounds remaining. I want to see if I can push him a bit further and secure a better price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $930,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 930000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $920000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. Can you accept it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob's offer is approaching my minimum, with only 2 rounds left, the risk of not securing a deal with either buyer is high.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $800,000, it's the safest option to secure the sale. It's better to have a guaranteed $800,000 than risk ending up with nothing."
