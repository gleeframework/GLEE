"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my budget of $8,000. It makes sense to reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit beyond my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $9,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still higher than my limit of $8,000.  Although there are more rounds available, it's getting close to the end of the negotiation.  At this point, it's likely that any further counteroffers will get rejected by Alice, and the price might not drop any further. It's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $8,000, as I'm guaranteed to get the product within my budget."
