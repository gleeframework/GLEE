"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit beyond my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $9,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
