"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are willing to pay up to $8,000, and she is offering it for $12,000. It makes more sense to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Is that something we can work with?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You can try to negotiate further with Alice, hoping to get closer to your $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference at $9,000?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we go up to $9,500? This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still more than you're willing to pay.  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to budge much further. At this point, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for $8,000."
