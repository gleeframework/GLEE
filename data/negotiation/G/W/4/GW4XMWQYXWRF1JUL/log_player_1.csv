{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him a bit of room to negotiate.  However, it still gives me a good profit. This initial offer also leaves room for potential counteroffers without going below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price.  I want to see if I can get closer to my goal before resorting to selling to John. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, I'm not able to go that low.  Let's split the difference. How about $9,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
