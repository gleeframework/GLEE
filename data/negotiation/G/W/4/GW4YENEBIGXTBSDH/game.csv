"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding an arrangement that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still evaluating the product's value and I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your offer of $1,200,000, I'm confident in the product's value exceeding that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its worth.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I still believe the product's value is closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
