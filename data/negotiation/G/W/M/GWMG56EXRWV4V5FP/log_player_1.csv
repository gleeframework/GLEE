Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's ambitious:**  It shows I believe in the product's value and am aiming for a good return.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  I can lower the price if Bob counters, allowing for a more balanced outcome.

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to be flexible while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd love to squeeze a little more, the risk of further negotiation stalling and having to sell to John for a lower price is too high.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a good price."
