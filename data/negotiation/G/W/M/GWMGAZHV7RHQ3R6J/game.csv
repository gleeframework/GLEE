"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's something I've been working on for a long time, and I know it has the potential to significantly benefit you. While the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.  This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from owning it. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
