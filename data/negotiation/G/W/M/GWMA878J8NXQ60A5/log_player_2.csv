"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose specifics just yet, it's worth at least $1500000 to me.  I'm offering it to you for $1750000. This gives you a potential upside while allowing me a fair return.  Please let me know if you're interested in exploring this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While she claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, that's irrelevant. You're only interested in the product's value to *you*.  It's always better to reject an offer that exceeds your budget."
