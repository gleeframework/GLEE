,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we settle on $15,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit concerned about the cost. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $12,000, which would be $13,500. Would you be willing to accept that price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
