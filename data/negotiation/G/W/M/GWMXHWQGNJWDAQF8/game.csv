"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this unique product! It's worth a considerable amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm starting with an offer of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that aligns better with my budget. How about we try something around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. Let's split the difference. How about $1,050,000? That's still a substantial discount from my initial offer and a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $950,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about $1,000,000? This seems like a fair compromise, given the significant value this product holds for you. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, this product would be valuable for me, and $1,000,000 is very tempting.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000, and we can close the deal?",975000.0,Bob,6,
