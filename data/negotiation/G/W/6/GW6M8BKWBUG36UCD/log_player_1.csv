Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. It would be perfect for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($150) increases your chances of a sale while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** $120 is a price point that splits the difference between your minimum and Bob's maximum, making it a fair starting point for negotiation. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, who values the product more than your backup buyer, John."
