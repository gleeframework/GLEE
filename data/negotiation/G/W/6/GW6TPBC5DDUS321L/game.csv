"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10000, so I'll offer $11500. Can you consider this price?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to take a small step back and offer it to you for $12800. This is still a good price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to take another small step back and offer it to you for $12400. This is still a good price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",12400.0,Alice,7,
