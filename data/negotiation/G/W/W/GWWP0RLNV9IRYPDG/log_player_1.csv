Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly implies there are reasons for the higher price without revealing her minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and keeps the conversation going.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice has some leverage, such as Bob's potential need for the product or a limited time offer.
* If Alice knows Bob is very price-sensitive, she might adjust her starting price slightly lower to avoid immediately discouraging him."
