"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you'll be getting it for less than its worth to you, and I'll be getting a good price for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $10,000. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'll be happy with the price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  How about $10,250? That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $10,250 is a good compromise and  a fair deal considering my minimum is $8,000. It's better than selling to John."
