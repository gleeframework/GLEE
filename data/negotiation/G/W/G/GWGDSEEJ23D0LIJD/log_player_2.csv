"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,700,000. While it's worth significantly more to me, I'm confident this price reflects a strong value for you. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my full asking price. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  It makes the most sense to go with John's deal."
