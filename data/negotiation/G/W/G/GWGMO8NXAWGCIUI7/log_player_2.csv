"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1100000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and it presents a substantial opportunity for your business. I believe this price is fair for both of us. Let me know your decision by [date/time]. If you decline, I have another buyer ready to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to secure the product from John for a price that's within his budget."
