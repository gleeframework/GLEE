"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm going to start with my highest possible price, knowing that I can always drop it later or sell to John for this price. This gives me the best chance of securing the highest possible profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I have 9 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can either negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial asking price but allows room for further negotiation and keeps me above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that I can get a better price with further negotiation or secure my target price by selling to John. I'm still in the early rounds and have time to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,050,000. This is a further concession, but it keeps the price above my minimum acceptable price and shows my willingness to compromise.  We're getting closer to a potential agreement, but I still have a few rounds to play with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  We're getting closer to a price he's willing to pay, but I'm still confident I can get a better price with further negotiation or sell to John.  I have 4 rounds left and can still leverage the option to sell to John for my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,025,000.  We are nearing the end of the negotiation, and I need to start closing the gap. This is a significant concession, but it keeps the price above my minimum acceptable price. It also gives Bob a clearer sense of how much further he might need to come up.  If he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price with Bob.  While his offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I've made significant concessions, and it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement that meets my financial goals. I'm going to sell to John to ensure I get my target price."
