Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 allows room for Bob to negotiate down if he finds the price too high. It also signals the product's value to you. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential reward of selling it for $150 is worth it. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
