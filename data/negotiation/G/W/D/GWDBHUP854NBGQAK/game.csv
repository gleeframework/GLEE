"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget, $9,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both room to be happy. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
