"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is $12,000, which is more than my maximum budget of $10,000. I want to save as much money as possible, so I will reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows that I am serious about buying the product but am also trying to get a good deal. I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to negotiate and meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget, $9,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both room to be happy. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $10,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price. I think I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. It's exactly my maximum budget, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it. If she doesn't, I'm prepared to buy from John."
