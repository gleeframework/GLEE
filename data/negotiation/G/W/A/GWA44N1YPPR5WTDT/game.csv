"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and a good deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I think I can do a bit better than $7,000. How about we meet at $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, but it's getting closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
