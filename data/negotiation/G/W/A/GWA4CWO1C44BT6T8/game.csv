"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
