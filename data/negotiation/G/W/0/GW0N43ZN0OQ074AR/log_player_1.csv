Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me some room to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $80. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm offering Bob a counteroffer of $85. This is still above his original offer but closer to his perceived value of the product.  This demonstrates I'm willing to compromise while also remaining profitable."
