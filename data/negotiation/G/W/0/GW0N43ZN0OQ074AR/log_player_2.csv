"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's not worth it to buy the product from Alice for $90 when you can get it from John for $80.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price lower than Alice's initial price, but still within your budget. It leaves room for potential compromise and allows you to see how willing Alice is to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $85 is closer to your ideal price, it's still more expensive than buying from John.  Since you have a reliable alternative, it makes sense to secure the product from John and avoid further negotiation."
