Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still offering you a substantial profit.  I'll be watching Bob's response and will adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to strike a deal that's favorable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
``` 

I'm raising the price slightly, but still leaving room for negotiation. My goal is to find a middle ground that maximizes my profit without jeopardizing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want it to be.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price and see if we can reach a deal that's beneficial for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
``` 

I'm now offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be enough to reach a deal and avoid having to sell to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum. I'm confident I can get a better deal, but the negotiations are taking too long. It's time to secure the sale and avoid any further risk of losing the deal completely.  Selling to John will guarantee my minimum profit, and I can always look for other buyers in the future."
