You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* You value the product at $150.
* Alice's offer is $125.
* While this is cheaper than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget.
* Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option. You'll still be able to buy the product from John, even though it's at your maximum budget."
