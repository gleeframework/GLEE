Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start negotiations significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't sell below your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning the ""value"" and ""potential"" are subtle ways to justify the high price without revealing your minimum. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" keeps the conversation open and invites Bob to counter-offer, starting the negotiation process.

By aiming high initially, Alice maximizes her potential profit while still leaving room to reach an agreement with Bob."
