"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my profit.  I'm confident Bob will find the value worth negotiating for, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $80 if I reject."
