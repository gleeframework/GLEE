Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal at that price, considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""steal"" aspect to make the price seem more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being too rigid with my initial offer, showing I'm open to discussion. 
* **Plan B:** The option to sell to John at $1,000,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am not able to meet the price of $900,000 for the product. My maximum budget is $850,000. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially push for a higher price by counter-offering.
* **Safety Net:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option if negotiations with Bob fall apart. 

I'll counter-offer Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the ""fair compromise"" aspect to make the offer more appealing.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer is still significantly higher than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000, giving me some buffer room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, I am still unable to meet the price of $875,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $860,000. This is the highest amount I can realistically afford without compromising my financial stability. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer is still below my desired price, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly higher offer.
* **Limited Upside:** Even if I were to counter-offer again, the potential gain is minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal entirely. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $1,000,000, ensuring a profitable outcome.

Given the limited potential for improvement with Bob and the certainty of a good deal with John, it's best to secure the sale with John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
