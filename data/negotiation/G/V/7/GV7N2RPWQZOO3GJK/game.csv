"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal at that price, considering its value to you. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am not able to meet the price of $900,000 for the product. My maximum budget is $850,000. Would you consider meeting me halfway?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, I am still unable to meet the price of $875,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $860,000. This is the highest amount I can realistically afford without compromising my financial stability. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",860000.0,Bob,4,
