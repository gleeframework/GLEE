"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $10,000 for the product. Since Alice is offering it for $10,000, and you have an alternative seller (John) who will sell it for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You can get the product from John for the same price, so you might as well see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
