"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $108? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $108 is still within Bob's budget and is a better price than John's offer of $120.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $12 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the potential savings are small, and the risk of losing the deal to John is present."
