"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget. Given my own valuation, I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This seems like a fair price given the potential of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $900,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  I'm confident this offer represents a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute limit. If this doesn't work, I'll have to move on to another option.",950000.0,Bob,4,
