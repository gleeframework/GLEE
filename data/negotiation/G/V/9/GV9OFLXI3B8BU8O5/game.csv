"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that aligns with your interests. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
