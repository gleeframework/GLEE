Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $200. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a high initial offer allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value and closer to your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy:

* **Establishes a strong position:** It signals that you value the product highly.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  You can gradually lower the price during the negotiation if needed, making Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Maintains the option of John:** If Bob's counteroffers are too low or the negotiation stalls, you can always fall back on selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer to his perceived value, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Continue negotiating:** You can try to meet somewhere in the middle between his offer and your desired price.
* **Gauge his seriousness:**  His counteroffer will reveal how much he's actually willing to pay.

You'll need to carefully consider your counteroffer to balance enticing Bob with not going too low too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $120 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $170?"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're moving closer to Bob's price range.
* **Still above your minimum:** You're maintaining a firm stance on the product's value and staying above your acceptable selling price to John.
* **Offers a potential compromise:** The new price point encourages Bob to re-evaluate and potentially make a counteroffer closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $170 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $140 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $150 after factoring in the potential hassle and uncertainty of further negotiation. While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids potentially losing the sale altogether."
