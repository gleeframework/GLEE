"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
