Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), giving him room to negotiate.**
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000), giving you room to negotiate as well.**
* **The message is friendly and encouraging, opening the door for a positive interaction.**

By offering a price in this range, you can potentially reach a mutually agreeable agreement, while still ensuring you earn a good amount for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can secure it for a lower price elsewhere. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is significantly lower than the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $11,000.  This price still allows for a good profit margin for you, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and the cost of purchasing it elsewhere, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still far too low for me. It's not worth continuing this negotiation.  I'll sell the product to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
