Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is significantly lower than the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $11,000.  This price still allows for a good profit margin for you, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of this product.
