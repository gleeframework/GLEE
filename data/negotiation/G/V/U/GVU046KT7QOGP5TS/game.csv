"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $105, so I'd be willing to pay $97.50. Would you be open to that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $97.50. I can offer you a compromise at $102.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $5.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $102.50 is the best deal. I'm willing to go up to $99, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to meet me at $99?",99.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $99. I can offer you a final compromise at $101. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $2.",101.0,Alice,7,
