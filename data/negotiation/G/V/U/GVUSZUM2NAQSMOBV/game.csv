"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to do $90?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $110, which is a great compromise. Let me know if that works for you!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little high for me.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in this product.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $107.50, which is the best I can do. Let me know if that's acceptable to you!",107.5,Alice,5,
