"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than $12,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. He has 10 rounds to work with, and the option to go with John at any time.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore the possibility of a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a lower price point and allows for negotiation. Bob wants to keep the counteroffer close to his maximum budget, but still leave room for potential compromise. This counteroffer reflects a 10% discount from Alice's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price by $500, but Bob can still potentially get a better deal. Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring the possibility of a lower price. He still has 7 rounds left and the option to buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise but still staying within his budget. He's also taking into account that Alice is likely to want to close the deal before he goes to John, so he's not moving drastically lower. This counteroffer represents a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,900, which is only $900 above Bob's maximum budget. At this point, Bob is getting a good deal. He has three more rounds, but continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal to another buyer, and Alice may not be willing to go lower. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while saving $1,100 compared to John's offer."
