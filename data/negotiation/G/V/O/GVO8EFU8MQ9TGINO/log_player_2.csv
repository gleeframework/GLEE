"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1400000. It's a fair price considering its value to you and the market.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $1300000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you and is closer to my minimum asking price. Let me know if you're open to this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her original price but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. Accepting this offer means Bob saves $50,000 compared to buying from John and still gets a good deal.  There is a chance Bob could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting and ultimately going back to her initial price or even a higher price is high. It's in Bob's best interest to secure the product at this price and avoid the risk."
