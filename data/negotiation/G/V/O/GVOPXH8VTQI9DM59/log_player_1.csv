Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values it at $100, so you have room to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening:** A bold price shows you're confident in your product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum of $80.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $85?  Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $77.5 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  At this point, the negotiation is becoming time-consuming and potentially risky. Selling to John for $80 guarantees you a profit that meets your minimum requirement and avoids further negotiation."
