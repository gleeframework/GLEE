Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $8,000, and this offer is significantly higher.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not starting at a low price, suggesting you believe in the product's value.

This allows for a potential back-and-forth negotiation where you might be able to get even closer to Bob's value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below your desired price point. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get closer to your target.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  You show Bob that you're not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Increase Potential Earnings:**  You have the chance to push for a higher price through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for something a bit closer to $11,500. It's still a great deal for you, considering how much value you'll get from this product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, meeting halfway between your previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  You're not accepting his offer immediately, demonstrating that you're willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Clear Communication:**  You reiterate the value of the product for Bob, making a strong case for your price. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still giving you a good chance to secure a price closer to your ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a bit more, but $11,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to your desired price point, and it's significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. 

Accepting this offer allows you to:

* **Secure a Good Price:**  $11,000 is a solid price that exceeds your minimum.
* **Avoid Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob and ending up with a lower price from John. 
* **Close the Deal:**  This ensures a sale and prevents the risk of losing the deal altogether.

While you could try to push for a bit higher, it's likely that Bob won't budge further, and you risk losing the deal.  Accepting $11,000 is the most prudent choice."
