"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $10,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. It's a price that reflects the product's true value and I'm willing to be flexible, but not that flexible",14000.0,Alice,5,
