"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to sell for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $13,500? This is as low as I can go.",13500.0,Alice,5,
