"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my research and the product's market value, I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000.  This offer reflects a fair price for both of us, allowing you to gain a profit and me to secure a valuable asset.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. However,  $1,400,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,700,000.  This considers the product's unique aspects and potential for significant returns on your investment.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,400,000. This price represents a fair compromise, allowing you to gain a reasonable profit while ensuring I can acquire the product within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your firmness, but I need to be honest â€“ I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I value our discussions and would prefer to work something out with you. My absolute final offer is $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's true value.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but I'm still only able to offer $1,450,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. I hope you'll consider my offer and give us a chance to finalize this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
