Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While we could start higher, aiming just below his perceived value makes the offer seem more reasonable and increases the chance of acceptance.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
