"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price that's fair to both of us. I know you're interested in it, and I believe it would be worth a lot to you. I'm willing to sell it for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for less than its true value, and I'll make a good profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message tries to frame the offer as beneficial, $10,000 is still significantly more than your fallback option of buying from John for $12,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might incentivize Alice to lower her price closer to her own valuation of $8,000."
