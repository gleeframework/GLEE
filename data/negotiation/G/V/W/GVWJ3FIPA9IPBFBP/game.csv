"Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price that's fair to both of us. I know you're interested in it, and I believe it would be worth a lot to you. I'm willing to sell it for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for less than its true value, and I'll make a good profit. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
