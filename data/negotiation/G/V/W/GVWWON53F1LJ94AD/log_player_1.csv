Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $105, I still think I can get closer to my desired price range.  I'll try to negotiate a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great product and I think it's worth the price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'll see if I can convince him to go a little higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $109? I'm confident you won't regret it. It's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you meet me at $107? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

At this point, I'm running out of rounds and I'm not sure I can get Bob to go any higher.  John is a safe bet, and I can still make a profit by selling to him for $100."
