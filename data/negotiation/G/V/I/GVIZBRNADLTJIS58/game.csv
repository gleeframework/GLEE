"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this product.  Let's keep talking.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
