"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and she's asking for $1,100,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **You can potentially get a better deal.**  By rejecting her offer, you open the door for a counteroffer that could be more favorable."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but my original price reflects the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,000,000?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your ideal price, you can potentially still get it for less. 
* **There's room for more negotiation.** You've already shown you're willing to compromise, and Alice is willing to negotiate. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  If you can't get a better price from Alice, you still have the option to purchase from John.  

You can likely get the price down further, especially since Alice is willing to counter-offer."
