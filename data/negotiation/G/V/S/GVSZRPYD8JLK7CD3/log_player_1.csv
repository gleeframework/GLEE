Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($100) and slightly above what it's worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation by asking what Bob thinks. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter-offer. 
* If I'm not satisfied with his counteroffers, I'll move on to selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. This means there's potential to get a better price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** While selling to John for $100 is a safe option, I'm willing to take a calculated risk to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired price. I'll likely start with a price slightly below my original offer of $110, but above his offer of $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob! $90 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Positive Language:** I'm staying positive and expressing appreciation for Bob's interest. 

**Next Steps:**

*  I'll wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John. 
*  If his counteroffer is reasonable, I'll consider accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I really think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $92.5 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for Delay:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to further rounds and potentially lower offers from Bob. This could also risk losing him as a buyer entirely.
* **Time Value:** Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation delays.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll finalize the sale with Bob at $92.5, securing a profit for myself."
