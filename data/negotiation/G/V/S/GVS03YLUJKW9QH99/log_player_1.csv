Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,400,000 is a significant profit for you ($200,000 above your minimum) while still leaving Bob with a potential $100,000 gain compared to his perceived value.

* **Confidence:** The tone is firm and confident, reflecting your strong position with John as a backup buyer.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is fluid.  Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust slightly, but don't go below your $1,200,000 minimum."
