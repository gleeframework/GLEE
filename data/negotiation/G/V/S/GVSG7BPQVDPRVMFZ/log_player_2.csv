"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable opportunity that I believe will greatly benefit your business. My initial asking price is $1200000. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth and potential.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still within your budget, and there's room to potentially negotiate a lower price.  It's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your perspective,  $1000000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, reflecting a  significant discount from my initial price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but there's still some wiggle room. $1,100,000 is still a good price, but rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down further to meet your counteroffer.  Remember, you have a fallback option with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
