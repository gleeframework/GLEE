{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great fit for your needs. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price close to Bob's value of $12,000, but I'm leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also reminding Bob of the potential value of the product for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,800 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,800 is tempting, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of this product for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,500 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is above my minimum of $10,000 and is getting closer to the price I want. While I'd prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer is the best option for me at this point."
