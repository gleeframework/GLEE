Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and leaves a positive impression if Bob manages to haggle you down.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (even if subjective) can make it seem more palatable to the buyer. 
* **Urgency:**  Hinting that the product might be sold elsewhere (""listing it publicly"") could encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room:** While I want to maximize profit, offering it slightly below $150 leaves some room for Bob to feel like he got a deal if he negotiates.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
