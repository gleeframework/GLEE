Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could tap into.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance to make an offer to Bob.

**Offer Strategy**

You need to balance maximizing your profit with ensuring Bob accepts. Offering too close to $1,000,000 leaves money on the table, while going too high risks Bob rejecting the deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and highlights the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 incentive to buy from you instead of losing out. This price also nets you a significant $150,000 profit over your guarantee.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might slightly lower the price.
* **Relationship Value:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly less aggressive offer. 

This offer provides a strong starting point for your negotiation with Bob."
