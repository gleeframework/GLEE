Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as much money as possible.  Since Bob values the product at $12,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price ($8,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price still well above my minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a safety net with John who will buy it for $8,000. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation."
