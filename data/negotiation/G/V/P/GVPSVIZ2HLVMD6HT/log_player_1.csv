Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $100 was a bit low, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we meet at $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 
 
Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and $110 is a good profit above my minimum.  There's little guarantee I can get more out of him, and risking John's offer for a small potential gain isn't worth it."
