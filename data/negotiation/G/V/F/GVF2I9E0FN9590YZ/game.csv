"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a great product at a reasonable price.  Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? This would be a good deal for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate that. However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $109. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's close this deal!",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! How about we split the difference again and go with $108?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a sale while staying within my budget.",108.0,Bob,6,
