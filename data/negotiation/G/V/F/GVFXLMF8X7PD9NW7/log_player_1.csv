Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a fair price:** It's above your minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation for Bob.
* **It demonstrates confidence:** You're not giving it away cheaply, showing that you believe in the product's value.
* **It sets the tone:** This offer lets Bob know you're serious about selling, and you expect him to be serious about buying.

Remember, the key is to find a balance between getting the best price and not pushing Bob away.  You'll have to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
