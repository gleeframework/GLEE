"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting high with $1,800,000.  This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It also sets the tone for a strong starting point in the negotiation."

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I could settle for $1,200,000 with John, I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price.  There's still a good chance we can find a mutually agreeable middle ground."

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is a smaller step down from my previous offer, showing that I'm getting closer to meeting Bob halfway. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a more serious offer, as we are nearing the end of our negotiation rounds."

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob.  It's getting a bit risky, but I believe there's still a chance to get a better price.  If we fail, I can always sell to John."

This is my final counteroffer to Bob. I'm dropping the price slightly again, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept it. If he doesn't, I'll be forced to sell to John."
