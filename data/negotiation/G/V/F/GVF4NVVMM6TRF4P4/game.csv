"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,500,000 represents my initial assessment of the product's worth, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between its value and our mutual interest in reaching an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
