"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $600000 for this product. Let's see if we can work something out.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This price is still very fair, considering the potential this product holds.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $900000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's make a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $750000 is closer, but it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's aim for $850000.  This price recognizes the value you've expressed for the product, and it also allows me to move forward with the sale.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $850000 is still pushing my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $825000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair to both of us. Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,6,
