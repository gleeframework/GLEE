Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for this product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This price is still very fair, considering the potential this product holds.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $750000 is closer, but it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's aim for $850000.  This price recognizes the value you've expressed for the product, and it also allows me to move forward with the sale.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $850,000 is still pushing my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.
