"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $15,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at that price?",13200.0,Bob,4,
