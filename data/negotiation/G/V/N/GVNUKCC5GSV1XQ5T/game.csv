"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value,  $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe that's a fair offer considering its actual worth.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true market value. This product offers unique advantages and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects its value while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $1,500,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
