You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so you have room to negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to sell for $1,050,000. This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, you still have room to negotiate. You know you can get it for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to settle for $1,050,000 just yet.  You can try a counteroffer to see if you can push Alice down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,025,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,037,500?  This would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500.

You are very close to your goal price with Alice's offer, but you are still paying more than what you could get from John.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice.  It's best to go with the guaranteed price from John."
