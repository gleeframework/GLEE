"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. This product is valuable to me, but that's my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to sell for $1,050,000. This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know if this works for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. How about $1,025,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,025,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,037,500?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
