"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum, I'm setting a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and give me more negotiating room.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price allows me to gradually decrease the price during subsequent rounds, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above my minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence in the product's value reinforces the justification for the high asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his own valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm better off rejecting this offer and trying to negotiate a better deal. I have enough rounds left to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 undervalues the product's unique features and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I've made a substantial reduction of $300,000 from my initial offer, signaling flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** I've reiterated the product's value to justify the price, aiming to shift Bob's focus away from purely his valuation. 
* **""Fair Deal"" Emphasis:** By highlighting fairness, I'm suggesting a win-win outcome while subtly anchoring the negotiation around a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,900,000 is closer to my range, it's still above what I can reasonably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  I believe this offer gives us both a good outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and provides a profit of $100,000. While I could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away in subsequent rounds. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
