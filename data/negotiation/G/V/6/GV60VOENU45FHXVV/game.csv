"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's something that I'm confident will greatly benefit your business, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I know is competitive. I'm asking for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential value you'll gain.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
