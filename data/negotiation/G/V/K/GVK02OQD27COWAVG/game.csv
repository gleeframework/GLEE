"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for me right now. I'm thinking something closer to $5,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $9,000? That would still leave me with some room for profit, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's more my budget and would be a good deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
