Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for me right now. I'm thinking something closer to $5,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price ($15,000). While it's tempting to accept anything, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'll counter with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $9,000? That would still leave me with some room for profit, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's more my budget and would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's too low, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
