"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Considering its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than $80. Would you be interested in discussing a fair price? My initial offer is $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while still buying the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $120 is too high for Bob, as he's willing to pay a maximum of $150.
* **Rejecting the offer:**  This allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the quality of the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. After considering your offer, I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it while also considering your budget. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Still to save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $110 is still above Bob's ideal price point, but it's closer to his maximum.
* **Rejecting the offer:**  This keeps the negotiation going and might lead to a lower price in the next round.  While Bob could buy from John for $150, he's hoping to get a better deal from Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. In light of our previous discussions, I am willing to consider a price of $107 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value I place on the product and your budget. Please let me know if this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $107 is only $7 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $100.
* **Accepting the offer:**  This is a good deal for Bob, as he's able to buy the product for significantly less than John's price of $150.  While he could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are not substantial enough to risk losing the deal."
