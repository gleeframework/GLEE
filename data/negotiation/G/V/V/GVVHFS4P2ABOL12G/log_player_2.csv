"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's much better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price. You can always fall back to John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a very aggressive counteroffer, starting at your maximum budget. It's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it establishes your firm limit and sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above your comfort zone. It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since you can always fall back on John if this negotiation fails.  The goal is to get as close to your $1,000,000 limit as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between your previous offer and Alice's last offer. It shows you're willing to negotiate but still trying to stay within your budget. It gives Alice some room to negotiate while also pushing her further towards your target price."
