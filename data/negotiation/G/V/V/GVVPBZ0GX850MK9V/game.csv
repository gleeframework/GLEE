,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm happy to come down a bit, but $80 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This gives us both a fair deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can meet you at $90, but I'm willing to go up to $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point, but $85 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down to $88 to make this deal happen.  Let's close this out and both be happy with the deal.",88.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit off. I'd be willing to meet you at $82. That's the lowest I can go.",82.0,Bob,6,
