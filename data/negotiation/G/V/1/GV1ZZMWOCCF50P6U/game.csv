"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is $1500000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's an intriguing product, but I'm not sure I can justify $1200000 at this point. I'm willing to pay $900000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to me is $1500000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a fair compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer it to you for $1025000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering its true value to me is $1500000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1025000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1000000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1075000. This is the best I can do, considering its true value to me is $1500000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're holding firm, but $1075000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, which is a significant compromise for me.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
