"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting to build rapport with Bob.
* **Open Ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can find similar products within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $120 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price this early in the process.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiating power in my hands and allows me to control the direction of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $200 to $175, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value by mentioning a ""middle ground,"" implying that $120 doesn't reflect the product's worth.
* **Open to further discussion:** The question ""What do you think?"" keeps the conversation open and invites Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value I perceive in the product, I am comfortable paying $150. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 meets my minimum acceptable price.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal.
* **Time is Money:** We are already in round 4, and there's a risk that Bob might reject further counteroffers, potentially leading to a lower price or selling to John at the same price. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price, securing a win for me."
