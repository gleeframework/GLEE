"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $120 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
