"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product that could be a game-changer for your business.  I believe its worth to you could be significantly higher than the price I'm offering.  I'm asking $900000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than the $1,000,000 you would pay John.  Since your maximum budget is $1,000,000, accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 and still allows you to acquire the product."
