"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to negotiate, especially since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice. There's room for a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high. It's important to make a significant counteroffer to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and to show Alice that you are serious about a lower price.
* **Value difference:**  $950,000 is a price that still leaves a substantial profit margin for Alice (as it's higher than her value of $1,000,000). 
* **Room for negotiation:** This counteroffer provides room for further negotiation, allowing for a potential middle ground to be found during subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still too high.  While it is a slight decrease from the initial $1,100,000, it's important to continue negotiating to secure a better price.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to your goal of saving money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** This counteroffer is a significant step towards Alice's last offer of $1,150,000, showing that Bob is willing to negotiate and meet halfway. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  The price is still above Alice's value of $1,000,000, ensuring that Alice has an incentive to reach an agreement.
* **Strategic compromise:**  By offering $1,050,000, Bob is demonstrating flexibility while still trying to secure a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is still ongoing:** Alice has lowered her price slightly but it's still too high. There's potential to get a better price with continued negotiation.
* **Avoiding the middle ground:** Accepting Alice's offer would mean paying significantly more than the middle ground of $1,100,000, which could be reached with further negotiation.
* **Time is on our side:** We have multiple rounds left, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and push for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the middle ground:** This counteroffer represents the middle ground between Bob's previous offer of $1,050,000 and Alice's offer of $1,175,000.  It signals a willingness to compromise and reach a fair deal.
* **Saving money:** While not the lowest price, this offer still saves Bob $175,000 compared to the original asking price and is significantly less than what John is offering.
* **Closing the deal:** By offering the middle ground, Bob is increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting, bringing the negotiation closer to a successful conclusion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is the same as John's:** Alice's offer of $1,200,000 matches the price John is willing to sell for. There is no further negotiation to be done with Alice. 
* **Time is running out:**  With only three rounds remaining, the negotiation is becoming increasingly time-consuming. It's important to secure the product, and both John and Alice are offering the same price.
* **No benefit to continuing:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of reaching a stalemate or a worse deal. Buying from John guarantees the product at a known price. 

It's more efficient and less risky to buy from John, who is already offering a price within Bob's budget."
