"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's valuation of the product, but still allows for potential negotiation. It also leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary.  

I'm starting high, but I'm ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response and to potentially sell to John if the deal doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too far off the mark. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. That's a fair price, considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving, but it's still above my minimum price. If Bob accepts, I'll make a decent profit. If he rejects, I'll have another opportunity to adjust my price.  I'm willing to go down a bit further, but I'm not willing to go below $140 yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, his offer is still below $150. I'm going to reject his offer again and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable going below $135. This is a high-quality product, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm sticking to my minimum price point while trying to make a small concession.  If Bob still refuses, I'm prepared to sell to John for $150, which would be more profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is high-quality, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum price of $150.  I've made several concessions, and I'm not confident that we'll reach an agreement. With only a few rounds left, it's more advantageous for me to sell the product to John for $150. This guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiations that might not be successful."
