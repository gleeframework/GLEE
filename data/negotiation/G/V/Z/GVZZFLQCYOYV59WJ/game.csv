,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $110. It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $102.50. This is a final offer from me. If it doesn't work for you, I'll be selling the product elsewhere. ",102.5,Alice,5,
