Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal considering its value to me! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is a significant discount from my minimum price of $150. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit.
* **Positive Framing:** My message highlights the value proposition for Bob and positions the offer as a ""deal.""
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm open to negotiation by inviting Bob to respond with his thoughts, setting the stage for potential counteroffers.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I'm aware of the option to sell to John for $150, but I'm aiming for a higher price. I will only switch to John if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable or if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's also well below the initial offer of $130, making it clear that Bob is trying to exploit my need to sell.
* **Opportunity to counter:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. I'll use the next round to try and find a middle ground.
* **John as a fallback:**  I'm aware of John's offer of $150, but I'm willing to explore more negotiation with Bob before taking that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $110. It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** My counteroffer of $110 represents a compromise from my previous offer of $130, but I justify it by highlighting the value of the product. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in completely.
* **Positive Framing:** I use phrases like ""great deal"" and ""fair price"" to frame the offer in a positive light for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I again invite Bob to find ""common ground,"" signaling that I'm willing to continue negotiating if necessary. 

**Goal:** This counteroffer aims to meet Bob halfway, while still maintaining a profitable price for myself. I believe $110 is a reasonable price that could be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $95 is a slight improvement from his previous offer of $90, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and significantly less than my last counteroffer of $110.
* **Negotiation window closing:**  Bob's continued insistence on a low price indicates he's not willing to meet me halfway.  
* **John's offer is a viable alternative:**  Since Bob is unwilling to budge much, it's becoming more likely that John's offer of $150 is the best option to maximize my profit.  

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make one final counteroffer to attempt to find a compromise. If he rejects it again, I will move forward and sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $102.50. This is a final offer from me. If it doesn't work for you, I'll be selling the product elsewhere. "", ""product_price"": 102.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality and urgency:** I use phrases like ""final offer"" and ""selling the product elsewhere"" to create a sense of urgency and pressure Bob to accept. This is important because I'm close to accepting John's offer, which would give me a higher profit.
* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $102.50 represents a genuine attempt to meet Bob halfway between his offer of $95 and my previous offer of $110. 
* **Clear ultimatum:** I make it clear that this is my last offer,  leaving Bob with the decision to accept or reject the deal.

**Goal:** This counteroffer aims to push Bob to the brink, making him more likely to accept my offer. If he rejects, I'm prepared to move on to John, securing a higher profit."
