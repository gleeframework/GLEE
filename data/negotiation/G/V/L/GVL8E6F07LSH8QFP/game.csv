"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is as high as I can go.  If you're unable to do that, I understand, but I'm hoping we can make a deal work.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
