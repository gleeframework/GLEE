"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) and slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially capture a larger portion of the surplus. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the value the product offers Bob, focusing on the potential benefits rather than just the price. 

**Important Note:** I'm not yet considering the option of selling to John. I want to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I have room to negotiate further.
* **Ten rounds:**  I have ten rounds to reach a better deal, and I'm not in a rush to settle. 
* **Exploring options:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and potentially find a price point that is more advantageous.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my initial offer, but still allows for some wiggle room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the product's significant value and the benefits it offers. I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits us both. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a compromise by lowering my price, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still profitable:**  $1,100,000 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable value and closer to my initial asking price.
* **Positive framing:**  The message focuses on the product's value and the shared benefits of reaching an agreement. 

**Important Note:** I'm aiming to find a price point that works for both of us. If Bob continues to push for a lower price, I'm prepared to go through more rounds and adjust my offers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for better outcome:** I have several more rounds to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Weighing options:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I'm still hopeful of getting closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is a slight reduction from my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $1,050,000.  This price is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. This shows a willingness to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Still above minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, ensuring I get a good return on the product.
* **Emphasis on closing the deal:** The message emphasizes the need to reach a final agreement and move forward, showing a desire to conclude the negotiation.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to carefully weigh my options in the following rounds. Selling to John for $1,000,000 becomes a more attractive option, as there's a risk of further concessions leading to a lower final price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, the risk of further concessions outweighs the potential gain.
* **Time is running out:**  We are already in round 6 out of 10. Continuing to negotiate with Bob could result in a lower final price. 
* **Secure a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,000,000, which is a good outcome considering the limited time remaining. 

**Conclusion:** Given the limited time, the risk of further concessions with Bob, and the secure profit offered by John, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
