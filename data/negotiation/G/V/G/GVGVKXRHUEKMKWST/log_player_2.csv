Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This is a significant discount from her initial offer, and it might encourage her to come down a bit."

Alice is showing flexibility by coming down from her original price.  It's still worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can get closer to my target price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is back to her original price, but we've still made progress in the negotiation. It's worth trying to see if we can get her to budge a little more. We're getting close to the halfway point in our negotiation, and it's not the right time to buy from John yet."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
