Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

We're still significantly above John's offer, and conceding too quickly might make Bob undervalue the product. Let's counter and see if we can reach a better agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,070,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our absolute bottom line, we still have room to negotiate. It seems like Bob is willing to move in smaller increments.  We'll try to guide him closer to at least $1,090,000 without losing the deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close.  I'm willing to accept a slight reduction, but $1,070,000 is cutting it too close. How about we finalize the deal at $1,090,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to walking away from the deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,070,000 and $1,090,000. How about we settle on $1,080,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's willing to walk away. While we could push for a slightly higher price, the difference is relatively small now. Accepting $1,080,000 gives us a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away, potentially leaving us with nothing."
