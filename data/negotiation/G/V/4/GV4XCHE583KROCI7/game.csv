"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $65?",65.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's still a great price for the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
