Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.
