"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. Can you meet me in the middle?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we split the difference and settle on $85?  It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $70, so how about we try $77.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm trying to be flexible. While $77.50 is closer, I'm still not comfortable going below $82. It's a great product and I believe it's worth the price. What do you say?",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $80. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $79.99. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",79.99,Bob,6,
