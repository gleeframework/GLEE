I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to try to push for a higher price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $16,500. This is still above my minimum price, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate."

Bob is not budging on his price. While I'd prefer to get a little more, time is money, and I don't want to risk losing any more time negotiating. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
