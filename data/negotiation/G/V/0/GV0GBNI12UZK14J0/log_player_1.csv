Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob's counteroffer demonstrates his interest in the product, suggesting there's room for further negotiation.
* **Strategic rejection:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control and signal my willingness to continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,050,000?  This price would still allow you a significant return on your investment, and it's closer to my valuation."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards middle ground:** This counteroffer is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting value for Bob:** I reiterate the potential return on investment to emphasize the product's worth for him.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  The price is still above my minimum, but it's a clear signal that I'm ready to close the deal if he's willing to meet halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

* **Room for further negotiation:** Bob's willingness to compromise shows he's interested in the deal and there's potential to get a higher price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting the offer, I keep the negotiation going and potentially get a better outcome.

{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $975,000 is a step in the right direction,  I'm still hoping we can find a price that reflects the true value of this product for both of us.
