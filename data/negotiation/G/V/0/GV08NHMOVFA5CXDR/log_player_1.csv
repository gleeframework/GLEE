"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential benefits for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valuable.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase. If he outright rejects this high price, it suggests the negotiation might be challenging. 
* **Leave Room for Concessions:**  By starting high, I have space to make concessions in later rounds, which can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.

The goal is to maximize profit, but I also need to be mindful of not alienating Bob with an unrealistically high starting price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). Accepting now would mean a substantial loss. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount.  I'll counter in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $12,000 undervalues the product's capabilities and the long-term benefits it offers.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $18,500?"",
""product_price"": 18500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By significantly reducing the price from my initial offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Strategic Concession:**  While a large drop, $18,500 keeps me well above both Bob's offer and my minimum price. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to subtly counter Bob's perception of its market worth. This reinforces the idea that the price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which indicates a willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. The difference now is small, but I'll aim to secure at least a bit more in the next round. The risk of losing the deal to John is becoming more significant, but I believe there's still room to bargain with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on the price. Given the product's value and to close this deal, I can go down to $16,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm signaling that I'm at my limit, adding weight to the proposal.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  $16,000 is a strong compromise â€“ significantly exceeding Bob's last offer while still netting me a profit above my minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept rather than risk the deal falling through. 

This offer balances profitability with the increasing risk of Bob walking away or stalling negotiations until I'm forced to take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's become clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price. He's incrementally increasing his offers, but at this pace, it's unlikely we'll reach a mutually beneficial agreement within the remaining rounds. 

* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of losing a guaranteed sale to John at my desired price.
* **Time Value:**  Each round spent on a potentially fruitless negotiation is time I could be dedicating to other deals or opportunities.

While selling to Bob would be ideal, accepting John's offer ensures I get my minimum price without further delay or risk."
