Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but also reflects the value of the product to me.  I'll keep in mind John's offer of $10,000 as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't at least meet my minimum requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is serious about buying.  I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my minimum requirement and is the same price John is offering.  I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid any further negotiation and secure the sale."
