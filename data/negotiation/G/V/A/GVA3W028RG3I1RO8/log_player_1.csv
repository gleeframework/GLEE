Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Minimum:** I value the product at $15,000, so anything less is a loss for me.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **John's Value:**  John is willing to pay my minimum, $15,000.
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering Bob a price of $14,000. This is a good deal for both of us.  It's more than Bob's value but less than my minimum.

**Outcome:**

* If Bob accepts, I make a profit of $1,000.
* If Bob rejects, I sell to John for $15,000, making a profit of $3,000.

This strategy maximizes my potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product at a price that's better than his alternative (not buying it)."
