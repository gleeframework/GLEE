Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can then negotiate down while still aiming for a profit that exceeds my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to accept a price that is significantly below my minimum. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is still a decent profit for me, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm not confident I can negotiate a price that meets my minimum.  Selling to John guarantees me a decent profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
