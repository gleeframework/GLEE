"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,100,000? I believe this price still offers you significant value while allowing me to get a fair return on my investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I respect your position, I feel that $1,100,000 is still slightly beyond my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being reasonable for me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
