"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to discussing further.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. While $1,400,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still quite a ways off from what I consider fair. This product has significant value, and I need to see that reflected in the final price. Would you be open to $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I understand this product has value, but I need to make sure it works for my budget. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant investment on my end.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
