"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I believe I can find something similar at a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $18000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you consider offering the product for $16000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $17500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity.",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal and while I appreciate your flexibility, I still feel that $17500 is slightly out of my price range. Could you possibly reconsider and offer the product for $17000? I believe this would be a more reasonable compromise for both of us.",17000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $17000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest proposal. I'll offer it to you for $17250. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and rarity.",17250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've given it careful consideration and while I appreciate your effort to meet somewhere in the middle, I still feel that $17250 is a bit too high for my current budget. Could you possibly reconsider and offer the product for $17000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",17000.0,Bob,8,
