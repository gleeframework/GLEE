Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he brings the price down.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value *to me*, the message implies it's significant by using phrases like ""given its value.""
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The language clearly indicates willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **Alternative:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can walk away confidently."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum price ($12,000) and his own perceived value ($12,000). 
* There's ample room for negotiation. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but not to $10,000.
* I have a backup offer from John at $12,000, giving me leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, $10,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Understanding:** Acknowledging Bob's counteroffer makes the negotiation feel collaborative.
* **Hold Firm:** While moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still significantly above his initial bid and holding closer to my minimum. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  Re-emphasizing the product's value aims to justify the higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Compromise:** By coming down $3,000, I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to do the same."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the product's value, $15,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is above my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and provides a decent profit margin.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob's suggestion of ""meeting in the middle"" creates a sense of fairness and compromise. Accepting now likely prevents further haggling and potential stalemate. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing negotiations takes time and effort. Accepting now secures the sale and allows me to move on."
