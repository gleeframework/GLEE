"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still a significant investment for you. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower the price to $975,000. This reflects both the value the product brings to you and my willingness to reach an agreement.  I believe this price is fair and allows us to move forward.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm making a counteroffer of $962,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",962500.0,Bob,4,
