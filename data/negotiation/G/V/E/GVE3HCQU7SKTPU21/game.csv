"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value you place on the product while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
