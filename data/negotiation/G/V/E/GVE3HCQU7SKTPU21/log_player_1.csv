{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. It's a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. It also highlights the potential benefit for both parties.  I'm keeping the option of selling to John open, as that's my guaranteed minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'd like to maximize my profit, selling to John ensures I reach that minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal with a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am unable to agree to $1,150,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the product's worth to me.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to sell to John for $1,200,000, accepting this offer is still a good outcome.  It saves me time and effort in continuing the negotiation, and I am guaranteed a profit."
