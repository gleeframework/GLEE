"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and allows you to still make a profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,575,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's work together to make this happen.",1575000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,575,000 is still slightly out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.

Let's reach an agreement and finalize this deal.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
