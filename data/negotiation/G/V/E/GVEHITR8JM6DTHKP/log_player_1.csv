"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and allows you to still make a profit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, it's below my minimum price and leaves less room for negotiation. I'll see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,575,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1575000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,575,000 is still slightly out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,525,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it's closer to your desired price. Let's reach an agreement and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,525,000 is close enough to my desired price and allows me to close the deal.  I'm going to accept it to avoid risking losing the sale to another buyer or further negotiation."
