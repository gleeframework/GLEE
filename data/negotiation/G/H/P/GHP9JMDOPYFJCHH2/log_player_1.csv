"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, knowing that Bob is likely to reject it. This will give me an opportunity to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum.  I will counteroffer in the next round to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still remaining above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I am still hoping for a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round to see if I can push Bob to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm making a small counteroffer, increasing my price by $5. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, the negotiation has gone on for a few rounds and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While $125 is close, I am concerned that I may not be able to push for a higher price in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, which is more important than the risk of potentially ending up with a lower price after further negotiation."
