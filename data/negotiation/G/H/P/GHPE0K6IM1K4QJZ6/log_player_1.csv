"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still lower than my minimum value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards while still ensuring a profitable deal for me.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Mentioning that it's a ""great deal for both of us"" subtly emphasizes the value Bob could gain. 

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a quick deal in the early rounds, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if needed. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am interested in purchasing the product for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball Offer:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum value, which means I wouldn't make any profit.  
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain my negotiating leverage and potentially secure a better price.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $10,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**  I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a compromise that's mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value, and it still allows me to make a profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.

**Strategy:** I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer as it's a reasonable compromise. If he rejects it, I'll likely need to make a more significant concession in the next round, or consider selling to John if the price isn't satisfactory."
