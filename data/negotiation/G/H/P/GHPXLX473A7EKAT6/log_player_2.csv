You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as you might be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I want to see if she's willing to come down from her asking price. If she rejects this, I'll continue to counter with increasing offers until we reach a price I'm comfortable with or decide to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $9,500. This is closer to Alice's latest offer, and I'm hoping it's more appealing to her while still staying within my budget. If she rejects it, I'll consider buying from John, as the price difference is becoming smaller."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now $11,000, which is only $1,000 above my maximum budget. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's relatively close to my target price, and it's more likely that I can get a better price from Alice in future negotiations."
