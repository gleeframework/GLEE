"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair deal considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""unique value proposition,"" we subtly remind Bob of the product's worth to him, justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** We signal that this is the *initial* proposal, implying flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I see the value in this product, but that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```
**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value. While his counter-offer was expected, accepting $900,000 would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table. It's too early in the negotiation to settle for such a low price. We will counter in the next round and try to move him closer to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,075,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** We politely acknowledge Bob's offer but firmly state it's too low.
* **Significant Movement:** We reduce our price by $75,000, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The new price of $1,075,000 is still well above our minimum ($1,000,000) and closer to the midpoint between our initial offer and his counter-offer.
* **Emphasis on ""Fair Deal"":**  We continue to frame the negotiation as mutually beneficial, encouraging Bob to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I understand the value you place on the product, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below our minimum threshold and significantly less than his perceived value. We have room to negotiate and should aim higher. We'll counter with a price closer to $1 million in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budgetary considerations."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We want to keep the negotiation moving positively, recognizing Bob's effort.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We decrease our price by another $50,000, showing movement but in smaller increments to signal we're approaching our limit.
* **Firm but Fair:** The $1,025,000 offer keeps us above our minimum while still leaving a small margin for Bob to potentially negotiate further. 
* **Closing Focus:**  The language emphasizes finding a ""solution,"" subtly introducing a sense of urgency to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm seeing progress here.  How about we settle on a price of $980,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but we're still below our $1,000,000 minimum. Bob's offer of $980,000 is getting tempting, but we're only $20,000 away from our backup option with John. We need to push Bob a bit further to see if we can secure a price above our minimum.  We will make one more strong counter-offer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting close. I appreciate you working with me. This product is truly valuable, and I want to see it in the right hands.  Let's close this deal - I'm willing to accept $1,000,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sense of Urgency:** We emphasize that we're close to a deal and want to finalize it.
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is our ""final offer,"" we signal a sense of seriousness and limit further back-and-forth.
* **Meeting the Minimum:** We've reached our absolute bottom line of $1,000,000. 
* **Appealing to Value:** We remind Bob of the product's value and frame the sale as beneficial for both parties.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome in the remaining rounds:

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts the $1,000,000 offer, and we exceed our minimum. 
* **Alternative:**  If Bob rejects this offer, we can consider taking John's offer in the next round. We've demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and further concessions might not be strategically sound."
