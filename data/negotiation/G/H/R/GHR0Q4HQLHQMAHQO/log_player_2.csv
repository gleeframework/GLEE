"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob can potentially save $1,000 by negotiating with Alice. It's worth trying to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $6,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer of $6,800 is a good deal for Bob. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and the potential of needing to buy from John for $8,000 outweighs the potential benefit of a lower price.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,200 compared to buying from John."
