"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,001 for the product.

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less. I'm happy to pay $1,100,000 for it.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This offer is closer to what I can afford, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement in this round.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,150,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still not quite there with $1,250,000.  How about we settle on $1,200,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. I'm confident we can agree on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to move closer to your desired price. I'll offer the product to you for $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
