Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $170.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially earning a good profit.
* **Positive Message:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer down to $150, but I'll try to get closer to my desired price.
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll counter back or end the negotiation and sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $170 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  I can likely get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, perhaps around $140.  This will leave room for further negotiation if necessary.
* If Bob rejects my counter-offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  I believe that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering higher than Bob's offer:** I'm offering a price higher than Bob's offer of $120, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Positive message:**  Maintaining a friendly tone encourages Bob to keep negotiating.

**Strategy:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll have earned a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counter-offer. If it's close to $140, I might accept. If it's significantly lower, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is only $20 below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a quick sale:**  Accepting his offer means I can quickly sell the product without further negotiation.
* **Risk of losing out:** If I reject, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I might have to sell to John for a lower profit. 

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise that allows me to sell quickly and avoid further negotiations."
