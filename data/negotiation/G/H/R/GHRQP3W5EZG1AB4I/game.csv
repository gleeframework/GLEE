"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers. I believe this is a good opportunity for you to secure a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still allows me to recoup a substantial portion of the value I place on this product. Please consider this revised offer carefully.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but given my current budget constraints, I cannot exceed $1,250,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000 for your product. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still unable to accept it.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. This price still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the value I place on this product.  Let me know if this is acceptable to you.  If not, I may have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm working within a strict budget and I must remain under $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
