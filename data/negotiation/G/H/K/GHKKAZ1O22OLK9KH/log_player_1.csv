Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs.  I'm confident we can find a price that benefits us both.  How about we start the conversation at $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob's perceived value is lower, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your absolute bottom line. 
* **Negotiation:** This approach aims to open a dialogue. You're prepared to go lower, but only if necessary.  It's easier to negotiate down than up.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale with John at your minimum price, giving you leverage."
