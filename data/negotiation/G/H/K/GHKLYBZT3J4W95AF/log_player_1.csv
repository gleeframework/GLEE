``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. It's a reasonable initial offer that leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident in my product's value and I'm ready to negotiate if needed, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still gives you a solid profit margin, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable. I'm not willing to sacrifice a significant portion of the value of the product.  I'll counteroffer once more, and if he rejects, I'll sell to John."
