"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still gives you a solid profit margin, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $980,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,020,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows you to make a good profit.  If you're serious about buying, this is my final offer. Let me know what you decide.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
