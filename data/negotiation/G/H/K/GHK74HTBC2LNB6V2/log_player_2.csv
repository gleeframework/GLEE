"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget ($1,200,000 vs your $800,000 limit). There's no point in accepting it. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer starts with a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within your budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While your offer is still below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still outside of your budget.  You're willing to pay up to $800,000, and Alice is asking for $1,000,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can close the gap."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm still interested in the product, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still at my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This offer is a significant compromise from my previous offer and shows my strong interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to come down to $940000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $940,000 is still above your budget of $800,000. With only three rounds remaining, the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement is low. It's more beneficial to secure the product at a guaranteed price from John, ensuring you stay within your financial constraints."
