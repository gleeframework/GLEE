Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

It's best to start with an offer slightly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price higher than what John offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $95 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below what John is offering. There's room to negotiate further and try to secure a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair deal for a product of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

This counteroffer:

* **Splits the difference:** Showing a willingness to compromise can encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Stays above John's offer:** Ensures we're still aiming for a price that's beneficial for us.
* **Provides a justification:** Highlighting the product's quality reinforces its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still not able to go above $95 for this product. I hope you can accommodate my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is firm at $95 and unlikely to budge further. Accepting this would be less profitable than selling to John for $100. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
