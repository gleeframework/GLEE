``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500:**  This is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential value Bob will gain by buying the product. 

This offer is a good balance between trying to get a high price and keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum price, it's still worth exploring if I can get a bit more. I'm rejecting his offer because I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since he acknowledged the product's value to him."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference at $10,500? It's still a good price for you, and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $10,500 is a compromise, offering a slight discount from my initial offer but still a good deal for me.

By making a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation open while still trying to maximize my profit."
