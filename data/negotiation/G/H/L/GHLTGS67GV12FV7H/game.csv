"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Unfortunately, that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my target. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",8500.0,Alice,5,
