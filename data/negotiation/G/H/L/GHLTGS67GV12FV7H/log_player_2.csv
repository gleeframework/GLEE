"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

This offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Unfortunately, that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000), we leave room for negotiation and signal that the initial price is unacceptable. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message maintains a polite and interested tone to encourage continued negotiation. We don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away. 
* **Targeting a Deal:**  While $6,000 is a lowball offer, it provides a starting point to hopefully reach a price closer to our $8,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved closer to your range, $9,000 is still above your $8,000 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her statement ""This is my best price"" is likely a negotiation tactic. There's usually some wiggle room, even if it's slight.
* **John as Backup:**  You have a reliable fallback option with John at $8,000, which gives you leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to split the difference between her current offer ($9,000) and your previous offer ($6,000).
* **Showing Willingness:** By increasing your offer, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Below Max but Strategic:**  $7,500 keeps you below your maximum budget while leaving a little room for a final potential concession if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my target. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's final offer of $8,500 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000.
* **""Final Offer"" Stance:** Her language suggests she's unlikely to go lower. 
* **John is the Safer Option:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000, meeting your budget. 

While you might be able to push Alice a tiny bit further, it's risky, and the potential savings are small. Going with John guarantees you get the product at your target price."
