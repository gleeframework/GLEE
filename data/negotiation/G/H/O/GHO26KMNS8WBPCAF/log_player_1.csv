"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I'm aiming to maximize profit, I won't settle for a price that low. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $130. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value of $120. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly higher price.  I'm not eager to sell to John yet because I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counter-offering at $125. This is a further compromise but still allows me to earn a profit. I believe this is a fair price and hope Bob will accept it."
