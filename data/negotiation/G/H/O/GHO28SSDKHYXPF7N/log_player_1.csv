Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know if you're interested, this is a take it or leave it offer."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have a safety net.  Offering the product to Bob at a higher price allows you to potentially make a larger profit.
* **Strong Opening:**  Starting with a higher price gives you room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also establishes the product's value in his mind.
* **Clear Expectations:** By stating it's a ""take it or leave it"" offer, you create a sense of urgency and limit potential back-and-forth negotiations. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Value:** While $15,000 is a significant markup, you need to consider if it's within a reasonable range for similar products in the market. 
* **Bob's Perception:** If Bob perceives the price as too high, he might not even counter-offer and you'll lose the sale."
