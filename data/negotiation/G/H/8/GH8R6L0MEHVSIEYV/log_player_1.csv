Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, framing the high price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it's unlikely Bob will immediately accept. This sets the stage for a negotiation where you might lower the price slightly while still aiming for a final sale price well above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response and potentially adjust your price downwards to secure the deal. However, always remember your bottom line is $800,000."
