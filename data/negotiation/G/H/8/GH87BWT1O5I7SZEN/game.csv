"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than $8,000. Considering its true worth, would you be interested in discussing a price closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I propose we aim for a price closer to $10,500. Would you find this offer acceptable?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. Let's meet in the middle at $9,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try $10,000 as a compromise. It's higher than your last offer but lower than mine. Is this a price that could work for you?",10000.0,Alice,5,
