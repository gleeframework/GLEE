Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I'm confident you'll find it delivers exceptional value."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($800,000) as possible while still exceeding John's offer. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob wants to haggle) while still securing a substantial profit over John's offer.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys the product's value without being overly aggressive. This encourages Bob to seriously consider the offer.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential for a $150,000 profit over selling to John justifies the slightly bolder approach."
