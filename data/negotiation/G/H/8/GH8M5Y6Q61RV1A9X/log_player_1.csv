``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives me a chance to gauge Bob's interest and how willing he is to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is very appealing, but I'm unfortunately not able to meet your asking price. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it,  which is still a significant value for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, as I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a great price for a product worth $1,200,000 to you, and it gives you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a significant offer, and I hope you'll consider it.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will yield a better price. To avoid risking a longer negotiation that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I get my minimum value and saves time."
