"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point as it's above my minimum of $80 and leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than my minimum of $80, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is the lowest I can go. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm going to counter with $95, which is still a good price for me and leaves some room for further negotiation. I'm also trying to stay positive and maintain a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another offer. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is a decent price, it's still not ideal for me. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way we can both be happy."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $90.  This is a good compromise, as it's closer to his last offer and still above my minimum price. I'm also keeping the tone friendly and positive."
