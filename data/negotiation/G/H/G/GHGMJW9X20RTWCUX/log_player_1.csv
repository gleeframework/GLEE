Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately it's still a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good return on your investment while allowing me to acquire it within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob seems firmly rooted at $900,000.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price. It's time to move on to the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
