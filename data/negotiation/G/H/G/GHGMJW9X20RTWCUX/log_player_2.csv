"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and allows for a fair and profitable deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  He's willing to pay no more than $800,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately it's still a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good return on your investment while allowing me to acquire it within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the $850,000 offer is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  He's determined to stay under $800,000 and there are still rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob a chance to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  To show I'm serious about making this work, I'm willing to drop my price to $980,000. This is a significant concession on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is now closer to Bob's desired price, $980,000 is still too high.  There are still rounds left to negotiate, and Bob is determined to stay under $800,000.  Rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
