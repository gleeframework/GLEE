**Reasoning:**

Bob is highly unlikely to move significantly from his $970,000 offer.  While I could try to squeeze a few thousand more, it's too risky. He's signaled this is his ""final offer"" and I risk losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  It's time to cut bait with Bob and secure the sure thing."
