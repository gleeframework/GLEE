This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $300,000 less than John's price and $200,000 less than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Time Constraint:**  Alice has set a deadline, and while you have rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate might irritate her and risk losing the deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  It's unlikely you'll get a significantly better price from Alice at this point, and the potential savings might not be worth the risk of her walking away."
