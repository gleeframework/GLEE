"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own a truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I can go up to $1,150,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  To meet you halfway, I'll accept $1,225,000.  This offer stands until tomorrow at noon - I need a decision so I can explore other options if necessary.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,225,000 is closer, I'm still a bit uncomfortable with that figure. I could do $1,175,000 to make this work. Let's get this deal done!",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're dancing around the same figure. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price and reflects my desire to close this deal. Let me know your decision by tomorrow morning.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
