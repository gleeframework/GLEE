Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $14,000 is a good middle ground between your minimum price of $12,000 and Bob's perceived value of $15,000.
* **Shows confidence:** It demonstrates you're not desperate to sell and are willing to stand your ground. 
* **Highlights the value to Bob:** Reminding Bob of the product's value to him could incentivize him to accept. 

Let's see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further but I won't settle for anything less than my minimum.  

I'll counteroffer Bob, hoping to find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $13,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates that you're open to negotiation, but not at the expense of your minimum price.
* **Maintains your ground:**  It sets a clear expectation for the minimum price you'll accept. 
* **Reiterates the need for a compromise:** It emphasizes the goal of finding a fair price for both parties.

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a good compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would love to get closer to my initial goal, this is a fair compromise that ensures I don't lose out on a potential profit. I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
