Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $100 but leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, he has an incentive to accept. However, if he rejects, I can always go back to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for my minimum just yet.  I believe I can get a higher price, especially since the product is worth $120 to him.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting too low for my comfort. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm not willing to risk going lower and potentially ending up with nothing.  John is a guaranteed sale at $100, which is still above my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
