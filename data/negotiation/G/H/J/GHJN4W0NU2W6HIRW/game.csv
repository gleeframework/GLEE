"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about we settle on $1800000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to being interested in the product, but I still think $1800000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for it. Can we meet in the middle again?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, and I appreciate that. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer that's a bit higher than your last offer. How about we meet at $1700000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and your willingness to negotiate.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I've thought it over, and I'm still not willing to go above $1600000. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might be overpaying for the product. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1600000. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
