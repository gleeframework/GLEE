{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit further to $13,500.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

At this point, Bob's offer is getting close to my initial asking price, and I don't want to risk him walking away completely. I'm willing to accept $13,000, especially since I have John as a backup."
