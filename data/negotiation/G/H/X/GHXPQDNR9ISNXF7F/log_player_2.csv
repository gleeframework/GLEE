# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you've found a competitor offering the product for $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you the product for $975,000.

Alice is unlikely to go any lower and it's a reasonable saving compared to John's offer."
