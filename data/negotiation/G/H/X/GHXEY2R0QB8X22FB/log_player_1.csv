Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it offers."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy it for $120, our goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob first.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate or for you to offer a ""discount,"" making him feel like he got a better deal. 
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $119 seems more appealing than a round number like $120, potentially making Bob feel like he's getting a slight bargain.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he's price-sensitive, we always have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $120."
