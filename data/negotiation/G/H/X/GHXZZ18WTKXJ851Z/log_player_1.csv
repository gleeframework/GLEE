Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for you, and a fair price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly better for Bob than John's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation for me. It also opens the door for a friendly dialogue to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? It's still a great deal for you, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $900,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $900,000 isn't my ideal price, it is still above my minimum threshold of $800,000 and gets us to a point where a deal can be made. It's important to remember that Bob is a serious buyer, and this price is still a good deal for him. Further negotiation might not be worth the risk of losing him as a buyer."
