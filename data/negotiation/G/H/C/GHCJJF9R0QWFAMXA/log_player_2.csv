"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a special price, knowing its worth to you is significant.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than what Bob would pay John, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. Bob can likely negotiate a better price with Alice or simply go with John.  There's no immediate need to accept this offer."
