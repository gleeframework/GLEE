"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is asking $200.  That's way too high. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $200 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $100 for this product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $200 is already a steal for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $175? That's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

$175 is still too high. I'll reject and try to get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $175 is still more than I'm willing to pay. How about we split the difference and go with $150? It's still a good deal for you, and we can get this done quickly."", ""product_price"": 150}
