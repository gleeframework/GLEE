"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $200 is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $100 for this product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $200 is already a steal for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $175? That's a fair compromise.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $175 is still more than I'm willing to pay. How about we split the difference and go with $150? It's still a good deal for you, and we can get this done quickly.",150.0,Bob,4,
