Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, we've negotiated Alice down considerably. While we might be able to get the price a tiny bit lower, it's getting risky. Accepting at $127 gets us a decent deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing and having to pay $150 to John."
