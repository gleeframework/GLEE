**Reasoning:**  

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's trying to stay well below $100.  At this point, the small potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob aren't worth the risk of him not reaching $100. John offers a guaranteed $100, which meets my minimum acceptable price."
