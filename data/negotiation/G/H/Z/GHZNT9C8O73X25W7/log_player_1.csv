{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it gives you some room to negotiate if he counter-offers.  I'm also including a friendly message to encourage him to consider the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $95? That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92.5 is close to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can squeeze out a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $94.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 94}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $94. How about we meet at $92? I'm willing to make a final offer at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made his final offer, and it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to go lower, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
