,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $95? That way, we both get a fair deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $92.50?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $94.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $94. How about we meet at $92? I'm willing to make a final offer at this price.",92.0,Bob,6,
