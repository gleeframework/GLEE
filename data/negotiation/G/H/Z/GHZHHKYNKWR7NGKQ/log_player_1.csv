Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  $1,500,000 (You'll sell to John at this price if Bob refuses).
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 (He won't pay more than this).
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.  Any price within this range can lead to a deal.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA to maximize your profit. However, you need to be realistic.  If you start too high, Bob will likely reject your offer outright.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** 
    * Highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" to create a sense of value and scarcity.
    * Uses positive language like ""pleased"" and ""unique value"" to frame the offer favorably.
    *  Avoids mentioning your other buyer (John) to maintain negotiating power.
* **The Price:**
    *  $1,400,000 is a strong opening within the ZOPA, giving you room to negotiate if needed while still aiming for a high profit. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob.  He may counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or if it's time to walk away and sell to John."
