"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm confident you'll still get a great value at that price.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $87.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than $90.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's not let this opportunity slip away! ",90.0,Alice,5,
