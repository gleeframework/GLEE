"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending under $100. Would you consider lowering the price to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $85 is still a little low for me. How about $90? That would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
