"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to try to negotiate a better price.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This allows for potential negotiation space and shows my willingness to bargain.  I'm not sure what Alice's bottom line is, but I'm hoping this aggressive counteroffer will get her attention and prompt her to consider a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still aiming to save as much as possible.  I'm confident I can push for a lower price, and it's too early to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but still firmly believe I can get a better price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Alice while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,080,000 is tempting, I believe I can still do better.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate further, and I haven't reached my maximum budget yet. It's worth exploring a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1060000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly, demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good price.  This is a strategic move to see if Alice will accept a price that's closer to my desired range.  If she rejects, I'll have to re-evaluate whether to continue negotiating or accept a higher price, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is getting closer to my desired price range.  We've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it's getting risky to continue.  While I could potentially push for a slightly lower price, it's possible Alice might get more stubborn. Accepting this offer is a good compromise and secures the product at a price well below John's offer."
