"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,800,000.  This still reflects a substantial discount while acknowledging the product's worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I understand it holds value, $1,800,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
