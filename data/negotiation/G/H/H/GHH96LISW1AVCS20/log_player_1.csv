Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm only a few hundred dollars away from my minimum, and I'm still hopeful we can reach a better price. There are still a few rounds left, and selling to John is always an option if the negotiations with Bob fail."

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge much further. I've already rejected several offers below my minimum.  I'm running out of rounds, and I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a lower price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000."
