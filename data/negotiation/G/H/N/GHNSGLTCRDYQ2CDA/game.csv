"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and your willingness to sell.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, I need to be closer to $1,075,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to split the difference.  I'm offering $950,000 for the product.  This is a significant step towards your price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this and your willingness to find a compromise. While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I can't accept anything less than $1,000,000 for this product.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what I'm offering. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
