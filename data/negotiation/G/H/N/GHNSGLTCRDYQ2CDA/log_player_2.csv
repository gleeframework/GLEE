"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm initially offering it at $1,150,000. This is a starting point for discussion and I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she's offering it at $1,150,000. This is still too high for Bob, as he's aiming for a price no more than $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, I need to be closer to $1,075,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still too high for Bob. He wants to stay under $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get closer to his desired price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to split the difference.  I'm offering $950,000 for the product.  This is a significant step towards your price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this and your willingness to find a compromise. While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I can't accept anything less than $1,000,000 for this product.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what I'm offering.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $1,000,000 is still above Bob's desired price range of under $800,000. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John for $800,000, ensuring he stays within his budget.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a better price, and continuing the negotiation risks the possibility of losing the opportunity to buy from John altogether."
