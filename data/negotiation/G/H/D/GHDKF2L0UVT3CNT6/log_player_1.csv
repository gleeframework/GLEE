Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to make a deal at $1,300,000. This offer reflects my confidence in the product's potential for your specific needs."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, our goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first gives us a chance to potentially get even more.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and tailors the offer to Bob's business sense, subtly justifying the high price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** We don't know how good a negotiator Bob is. He might try to lowball us significantly.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  We don't know if there's a time limit to sell to Bob. If there is, we might adjust our strategy to be more aggressive or time-sensitive."
