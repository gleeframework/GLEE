"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a starting price of $18,000. I'm confident it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 6000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my maximum budget ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering a low price, I'm trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to my desired range. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm prepared for Alice to counter, and this low starting point gives us space to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $8,000? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching My Limit:** I'm now offering my maximum budget of $8,000.  
* **Signaling Firmness:**  By stating it's my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling to Alice that I'm unlikely to go higher. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm still willing to walk away and buy from John at $8,000 if Alice rejects this offer."
