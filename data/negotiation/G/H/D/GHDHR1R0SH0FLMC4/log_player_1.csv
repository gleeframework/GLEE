"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,025,000 is closer, it's still above what I can afford. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards my price point, but I'm still willing to hold out for a better offer. We're not so far apart that walking away is the best option yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your effort, $980,000 is still a bit too high for me. To move forward, I'm offering $925,000. This price reflects a substantial investment on my part and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. Let's see if we can agree on this and finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price point, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation, but I'll be carefully considering my options if the gap doesn't close significantly soon."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and see that you're serious about this purchase. I'm willing to consider a final offer at $955,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's wrap this up - what do you say?"",

**Reasoning:**  It's time to apply some pressure and signal this is my final offer. By framing it as a significant concession and a chance to close the deal, I'm hoping Bob recognizes it's a good price and accepts."
