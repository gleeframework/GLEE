Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very slowly increasing his offers and is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. At this rate, it's unlikely he'll reach a price you're comfortable with in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
