"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, and I know I can buy the product from John for $150, there's no point in negotiating with Alice.  Alice's offer is already at my maximum price, so I'm better off going with the guaranteed option."
