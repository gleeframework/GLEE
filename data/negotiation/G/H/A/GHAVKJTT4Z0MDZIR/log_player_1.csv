Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm willing to sell to John for $15,000, so I need to get at least that much.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so I can't ask for much more than that.
* **Negotiation:**  Offering $12,000 gives Bob a good discount, but still allows me to make a profit. It's a fair middle ground.

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point.  The best strategy will depend on many factors, like your confidence in selling to John, how much you need the money immediately, and how likely you think Bob is to negotiate."
