"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Since you're not willing to go lower than $110, I'll have to go with another seller who is offering the same product for $80. Good luck with your sale!",80.0,Bob,4,
