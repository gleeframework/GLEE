"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
