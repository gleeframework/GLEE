"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you've described. Can you meet me at that price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $825000.
