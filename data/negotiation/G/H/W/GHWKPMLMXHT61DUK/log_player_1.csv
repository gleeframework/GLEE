{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  This allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering it to me. I'm happy to pay $13,500 for the product, but I can't go any higher than that.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum of $12,000,  I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $14,000.  Would you be willing to go up to $13,800?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13800}
