"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering it to me. I'm happy to pay $13,500 for the product, but I can't go any higher than that.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $14,000.  Would you be willing to go up to $13,800?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,800 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to Bob's desired price point. While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, accepting this offer ensures a good price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers, potentially leading to a situation where Bob is forced to buy from John at a higher price."
