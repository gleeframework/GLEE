,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I think the product is worth more than $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on getting this product, but my budget is tight.  How about $110? I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to me, and it's within your range.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $120. I think this product is worth every penny of that price, and I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer it to you for $118. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",118.0,Alice,5,
