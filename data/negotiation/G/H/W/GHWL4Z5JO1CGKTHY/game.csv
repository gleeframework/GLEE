"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and while I value it significantly higher, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial savings for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair price.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
