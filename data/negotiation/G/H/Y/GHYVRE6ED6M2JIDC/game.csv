"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I believe the product's value is worth more than that, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $980000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a slight concession myself and offer $920000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've been given and the market value of the product.",920000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $920000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1000000. This is my final counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
