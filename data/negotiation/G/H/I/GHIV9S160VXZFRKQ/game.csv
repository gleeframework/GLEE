"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,000.  This gives you a good price and still allows me to get a fair value for the product.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,750.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
