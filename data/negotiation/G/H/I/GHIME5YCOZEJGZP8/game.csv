"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value. However, my initial assessment was based on the product's unique potential and long-term benefits, which justify a higher price point.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,950,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's true worth.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I've been really trying to find a price that works for us both, but I have to be honest â€“ I have another potential buyer for this product at a higher price.  However, I value our discussions and would prefer to do business with you.  My final offer is $1,650,000. If this doesn't work, I'll need to move forward with the other offer.",1650000.0,Alice,7,
