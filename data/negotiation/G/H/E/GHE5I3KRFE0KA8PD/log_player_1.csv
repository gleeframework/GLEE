{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give me some room to negotiate. I'm being friendly and enthusiastic to build rapport and potentially encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'm happy he's interested, I want to try and get a better price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $10,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd be willing to meet you at $9,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating with Bob, his latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and it's a quicker and more certain outcome."
