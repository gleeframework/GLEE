"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need something closer to my initial offer. How about $13,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
