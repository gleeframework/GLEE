"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for it.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach a deal quickly.",15500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good deal for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $16,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $16,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $16,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16250.0,Alice,5,
