Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  $4,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $12,000. This is still a good price for me, as it's above my minimum acceptable value, and it might be attractive enough for Bob to reconsider his initial offer.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage him to move closer to a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  While it's tempting to accept $6,000, it's better to keep negotiating in hopes of getting closer to a fair price.  I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can find some common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,000. This is a significant reduction, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and might encourage Bob to make a higher counteroffer.  At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum threshold, so I'm not willing to go any lower unless Bob makes a substantial increase in his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's very close to my minimum acceptable value. Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly higher offer, but it also risks losing the sale altogether.  Considering the possibility of selling to John for $10,000, it's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
