"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice's offer is $90, which is still more than your maximum value.
* You can get the product for $100 from John, which is your maximum price. 
* Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
