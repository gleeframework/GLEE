"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) but still below Bob's perceived value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes mutual benefit. I want Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, even though I'm starting high.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message invites Bob to counter-offer, which keeps the negotiation open and allows me to gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my desired price:** While $10,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I have room to negotiate for a higher price. 
* **The negotiation is progressing:** Bob's counter-offer shows he's interested and is willing to negotiate. This gives me reason to believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counter-offer.
* **Selling to John is not the optimal choice yet:**  While $10,000 is my minimum, I can potentially get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would give us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's the average of my previous offer and Bob's counter-offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and suggests a fair solution.
* **Positive and Engaging:** I'm still using positive language and emphasizing the benefit of reaching an agreement.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm still leaving some room for negotiation if Bob isn't willing to go up to $11,250."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm committed to finding one.  While $11,250 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit lower.  Would you consider $11,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my desired price.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and compromise. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, I risk Bob walking away or the negotiation stalling.  Accepting the offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing out.
* **John's Offer is Lower:** While I could sell to John for $10,000, this deal is for a higher price."
