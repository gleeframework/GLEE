Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for potential haggling if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Above Minimum:** The price is still comfortably above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $10,000.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
