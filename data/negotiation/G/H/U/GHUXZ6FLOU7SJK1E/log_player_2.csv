"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product at a price of $9,500. I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you, and this offer reflects its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting and counteroffering gives him a chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value to you is quite significant. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still above Bob's ideal price of $8,000, but it's lower than her initial offer and closer to his maximum budget of $10,000.  It's a reasonable compromise, and accepting ensures Bob gets the product while saving money compared to buying from John."
