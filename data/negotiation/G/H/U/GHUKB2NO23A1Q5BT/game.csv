"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still finding it hard to justify that price point.  Would you be willing to come down to $775,000? I feel that's a fair offer that reflects my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, considering its value to you and the market demand. I'm confident that this is still a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway once again.",825000.0,Alice,5,
