You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is better than $150, it's still above your ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $120, but it still leaves some room for negotiation.  Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, starting with a lower price allows for a possible compromise.  It also signals that you are serious about purchasing the product but want to secure a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is within your budget and significantly lower than John's price of $150.  While you'd prefer to pay even less, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the product to another buyer.  It's a good compromise to accept and secure the product for a reasonable price."
