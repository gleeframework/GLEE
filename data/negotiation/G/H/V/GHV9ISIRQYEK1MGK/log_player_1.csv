{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's significantly lower than Bob's estimated value, giving him room to counter-offer.
* **Provides a strong incentive:** It's much higher than your minimum price, giving Bob a good reason to negotiate.
* **Sets a positive tone:** The message is friendly and encourages a productive conversation. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly below the product's value to him ($1,500,000) and leaves substantial room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain my negotiating position:**  Accepting his offer would be a significant loss compared to my initial offer.
* **Explore further opportunities:** There's a chance we can reach a mutually acceptable price through counter-offers. 
* **Potentially secure a higher price:** If Bob is truly interested, he may be willing to increase his offer. 

Selling to John for $800,000 is a last resort, as it would yield the lowest profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a good compromise that acknowledges both of our positions. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($1,000,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still securing a good price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  $1,150,000 is still a significant profit for me and leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is truly interested. 
* **Staying positive:**  The message remains friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation open and productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Continue the negotiation:**  There's still room for Bob to increase his offer. He's clearly interested in the product, and further negotiation could lead to a better price.
* **Maintain leverage:** Accepting his offer would be a significant loss compared to what the product is worth to me.
* **Avoid a hasty decision:** I don't want to rush into a sale that doesn't meet my minimum financial goals.

Selling to John for $800,000 is a last resort, as it would yield the lowest profit.  I'm confident that I can secure a higher price through continued negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,075,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my last offer ($1,150,000) and Bob's offer ($1,075,000). It shows continued willingness to negotiate and reach a compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  $1,125,000 is still a significant profit for me and leaves room for a slight increase if Bob is truly interested.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer $1,100,000. Can you consider this offer?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,125,000.  Considering:

* **Potential for further negotiation:**  It's possible I could negotiate a slightly higher price, but there's no guarantee.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Bob may walk away if I reject his offer, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price from John.
* **Significant profit:**  $1,100,000 is still a substantial profit for me and exceeds my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.

At this point, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option to secure a sale and maximize my profit."
