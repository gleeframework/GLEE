"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a good compromise that acknowledges both of our positions. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,075,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer the product for $1,125,000. This would give us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
