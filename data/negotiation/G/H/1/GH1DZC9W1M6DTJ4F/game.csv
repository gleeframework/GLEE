"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm willing to make some concessions, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $12,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your investment. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $8,500. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your own investment. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,500. Considering my investment and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $9,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. If we can't agree on this price, I might have to look elsewhere for a similar product.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a fair price, considering my investment and the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a decent return on my investment. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,800 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $9,500. If we can't come to an agreement on this price, I will unfortunately have to look at other options.  I believe this price is fair and benefits both of us.",9500.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,500.
