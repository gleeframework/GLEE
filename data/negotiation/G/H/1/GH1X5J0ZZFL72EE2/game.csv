"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're interested.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $107.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $106.  I think that's a fair compromise considering we're both trying to reach an agreement.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $106. I'm willing to take another step back and offer $108. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",108.0,Alice,5,
