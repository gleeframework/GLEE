"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,750 is still a bit high for me.

I hope you'll consider my offer as a final attempt to reach an agreement.",11250.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $11,250 is a reasonable offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to compromise on the value of the product.
