Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's potential for him to pay more than your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance to make an offer to Bob.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit.  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases the likelihood of him accepting.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message starts by emphasizing the exclusivity and value of the product.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $100,000, making it a very tempting offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is fluid. While this offer is strong, Bob could still counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy if needed, but always remember your minimum acceptable price."
