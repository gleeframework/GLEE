,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it, as that's the maximum I'm comfortable spending.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $105 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $90. It's a fair price, and I believe it represents a good value for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $102.50. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings, and I think you'll find it's a good compromise.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $95. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to go below $100, as that's the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $100, so I can offer you the product for $97.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",97.5,Alice,7,
