Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $950,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly less than what I need to get. I want to see if I can push him higher before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While we are getting closer to a deal, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I think I can push Bob a bit further before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While we are getting closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which I think is a fair compromise. Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to consider your latest offer. However, I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $1,060,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, $1,060,000 is a significant amount of money, and we're running out of time.  It's likely that we won't be able to reach a higher price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to settle for John's offer, which is less than I initially wanted."
