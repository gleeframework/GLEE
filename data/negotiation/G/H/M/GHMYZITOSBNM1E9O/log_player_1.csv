"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation.  This sets the stage for a potential back-and-forth that hopefully leads to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I'm rejecting this offer and going into another round to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial value. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate, I can get a better price, or at least gauge Bob's true willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm making another counteroffer, slightly lower than my previous one, but still higher than Bob's latest offer.  This shows flexibility while keeping my goal of maximizing my profit in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to secure a better deal. I'm rejecting this offer and seeing if I can push for a bit more.  There are still a few rounds left, and I'm not quite ready to settle for this price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm making a final push to get closer to my minimum.  This counteroffer is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in finalizing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision. While $11,000 is only slightly above my minimum, it's still a better deal than selling to John. There's a risk that Bob might reject my counteroffer and I might end up with nothing in the final round. Accepting his offer ensures I at least make a profit."
