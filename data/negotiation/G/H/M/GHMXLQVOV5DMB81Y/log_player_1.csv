Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high but not too high:** $12,000 is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  This makes the offer attractive to Bob while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Framing it positively:** Highlighting the value to Bob makes the offer more appealing and encourages him to consider it.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for a potential win-win outcome. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll continue to analyze his counter-offer and aim to reach a price that is closer to my ideal price point, while still making the deal attractive to him. I'll also keep the $15,000 offer from John in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit. However, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob before settling.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counter-offer to Bob. My goal is to get closer to my desired price while remaining competitive. I'll likely offer a price slightly higher than Bob's $10,000 offer, but lower than my initial $12,000 offer.  I'll also emphasize the unique value of the product and the potential benefits of working with me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This still gives you a great price, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial $12,000 offer and Bob's $10,000 offer. 
* **Emphasizing value and compromise:**  The message highlights the value Bob is getting and reinforces that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  By stating ""What do you say?"", I'm keeping the door open for further discussion and potential adjustments.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiations moving forward while still safeguarding my interests and increasing the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop that low. I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000, so it's not worth risking further negotiations with Bob.  

Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price for my product, and it saves me time and effort in continued negotiations that may not lead to a favorable outcome."
