# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $15,000. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is way above his budget. He can get the same product from John for $8,000, so he has no reason to accept Alice's initial offer."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can get the same product from John for $8,000, so he has no reason to accept Alice's offer yet."
