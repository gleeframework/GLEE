"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is only worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is too high. He has time to negotiate and can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not able to meet your asking price. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it, but I'm not sure I can go higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16500. It's a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Although Alice has lowered the price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He can still try to negotiate a lower price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500, but I'm really not comfortable paying more than that. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice is not willing to go lower than $16,000, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  John is offering the product at Bob's maximum price, so it makes sense to buy from John to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the opportunity to buy the product at a good price."
