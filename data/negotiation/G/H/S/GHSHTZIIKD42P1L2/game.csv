"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825000.  This still gives you a good deal considering the product's value, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $825000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to offer you $800000 for the product, which is right at my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
