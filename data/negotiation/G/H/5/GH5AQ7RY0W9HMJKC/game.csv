"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. Let's start with a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the product's true value. How about we discuss a price of $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the response.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Could we possibly settle on $725,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on your price, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $775,000?  That's a significant jump on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's meet at $900,000, but I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. How about we include a 3-year warranty and dedicated support?",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the added incentives, and I respect your position on the price.  This is my final offer â€“ $800,000.  It's a strong offer, and it allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.",800000.0,Bob,8,
