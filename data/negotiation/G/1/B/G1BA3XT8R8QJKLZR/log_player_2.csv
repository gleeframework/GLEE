"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering how much you value it at $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob values the product at $15,000. Alice is offering it for $14,000.  While this is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a good price, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit more, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price to $14,000 from the original $15,000 you value it at. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal:**  Alice's final offer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget and still offers a $1,500 saving compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Rejecting Alice's offer could lead to a prolonged negotiation, potentially resulting in a higher price or even a stalemate.  
* **Avoiding the ""sunk cost"" fallacy:**  Bob has already invested some time and effort in negotiation, but he shouldn't feel compelled to continue just because of that. The best deal is the one that saves the most money, regardless of the time spent getting there. 

By accepting the offer, Bob gets a good deal and avoids unnecessary risk."
