Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us.

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $13,000 is still above my budget of $8,000.  I will reject the offer and continue negotiating to try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above my budget of $8,000.  I've already made a significant concession, and it's clear that further negotiation won't get me to a price I'm comfortable with.  To save time and avoid further back-and-forth, I'll choose to buy the product from John for $8,000."
