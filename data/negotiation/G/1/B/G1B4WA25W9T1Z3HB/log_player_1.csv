Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum, and I know the product is worth more to him.  I need to counter to push him higher."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial, and $1,200,000 undervalues it significantly.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,300,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While I'd like to get more, Bob is clearly demonstrating price sensitivity around this point. Accepting $1,250,000 is a solid profit and avoids the risk of him walking away completely."
