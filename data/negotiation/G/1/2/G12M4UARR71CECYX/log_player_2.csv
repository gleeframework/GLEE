"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $160. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offered price of $160 is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $160 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) than my actual maximum ($120). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is courteous and avoids being confrontational while clearly stating my position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $160 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make a deal. I can offer you the product for $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While $140 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's potential for a price closer to my target. I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching My Limit:** I'm offering my maximum budget of $120. This makes it clear to Alice that this is my final price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating I'm ""ready to close the deal,"" I'm adding a bit of pressure and suggesting that she might lose the sale if she rejects.
* **Maintaining Politeness:** The tone remains respectful and collaborative, aiming for a win-win outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I still need to make a bit more profit. I can offer you the product for $130. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** $130 is still slightly over my budget.
* **Alternative Exists:**  I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $120. There's no need to settle for a price I'm not comfortable with.
* **Potential for Stalemate:** Alice might be hesitant to go below $130. Rejecting might make her realize I'm serious about my budget or push me to consider John more seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but I've got to be honest, $120 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. If you're unable to meet that price, I completely understand, but I might need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm reiterating my firm stance on $120 as the maximum.  Repeating this makes it crystal clear that I'm not budging.
* **Introducing Alternatives:** By mentioning ""exploring other options,"" I'm subtly reminding Alice about John's offer without being confrontational. This creates a slight sense of urgency without being threatening. 
* **Respectful but Firm:**  The message aims to maintain a good relationship even if we don't reach a deal.  This leaves the door open for Alice to accept if she's willing to come down a little further."
