"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but your asking price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from the original price, but I still need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $1,100,000. This is my final offer for now.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,050,000.  Would that be acceptable?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I can do $1,075,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
