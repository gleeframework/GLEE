"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision to purchase it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further with Alice.  He's willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $1,200,000, so there is room for a deal that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,250,000?  That's still a good price for you and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, the current offer of $1,275,000 is a good deal for him.  It's lower than what John is offering, and it's not too far off from his desired price range. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Alice and having to pay more to John."
