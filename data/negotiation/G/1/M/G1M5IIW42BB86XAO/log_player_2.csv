It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can likely get a better price than $950,000, especially since Alice values the product at $1,200,000."

Alice is not budging much, and while $975,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still too high for you. It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer. You can save a significant amount by going with John, and the negotiation is already taking time."
