Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your deal with John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin for Bob if he buys from you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a good deal. Offering a price slightly below his maximum value increases the chances he'll accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" to pique Bob's interest.
* **Value Emphasis:**  You mention ""value and potential,"" subtly reminding him of what he gains.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 allows Bob a $50,000 profit margin, making your offer attractive while maximizing your profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  You express that this is a ""fair reflection"" to discourage excessive counter-offers. 

**Important Note:**  While this offer is likely to be successful, there's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate further or reject the offer.  Be prepared to potentially adjust your price slightly if you feel it's necessary."
