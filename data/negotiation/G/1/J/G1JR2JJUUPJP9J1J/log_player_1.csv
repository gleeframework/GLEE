Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I recommend:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he wouldn't rationally pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still giving Bob a reason to accept. Since you have a strong fallback option, you can be more assertive.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You start closer to your minimum acceptable price, leaving less room for negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" aims to frame the price in a positive light.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is your only other option) creates a sense of scarcity and encourages a quicker decision.

**Important Note:**  While John guarantees you $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly might be preferable to avoid potential delays or complications."
