Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, Alice is offering $132, which is more than your maximum value of $120. It's better to buy from John for a guaranteed price of $120.  You've already tried negotiating with Alice and haven't been able to reach a better price."
