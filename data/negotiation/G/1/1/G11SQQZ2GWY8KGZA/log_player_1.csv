{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than $150, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150.  That's the minimum I can accept.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 150}
