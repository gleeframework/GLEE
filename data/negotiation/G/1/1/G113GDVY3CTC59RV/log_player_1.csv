"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,750 is better than John's offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $11,500. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a bit away from that price point. Would you consider $10,900? I'm serious about buying and I think this would be a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with going below $11,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still above his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm firm on $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
