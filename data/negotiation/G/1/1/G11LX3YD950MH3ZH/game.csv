"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you've shown interest in. I'm offering it to you for $175. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $150. This is still a great price considering the product's value, and it's more than what another buyer is willing to pay. Let me know if you're interested.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering. Can you meet me at this price?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $130 is still below my minimum asking price.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product and it would be a good deal for both of us.",140.0,Alice,5,
