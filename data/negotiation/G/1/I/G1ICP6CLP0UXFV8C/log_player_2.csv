"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still above his maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I think this product could be useful,  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal.  He's offering $8,500, which is still above Alice's value of $8,000, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still leaving Bob some room to potentially negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $9,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again making a counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground.  He's offering $8,750, which is halfway between his previous offer of $8,500 and Alice's current offer of $9,000. This demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still aiming to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,875? This feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,875, which is within Bob's budget of $10,000.  While he could potentially continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers, and he might end up having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures a good deal within his budget."
