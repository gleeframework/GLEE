"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's less than its true value to you and more than what I would get from someone else.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. You can get the product for $100 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to save money."
