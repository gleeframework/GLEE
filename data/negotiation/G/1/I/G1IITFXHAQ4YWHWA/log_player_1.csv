{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity! This product is a game-changer, and I believe its value to you is immense. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a little high.  Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $850,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000. This price is still significantly below what you'd gain by using this product, and it gives us both a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$925,000 is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get a little bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that.  However, $925,000 still doesn't reflect the full potential of this product for your business. Let's compromise at $975,000. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to continue to believe in the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
