"Hi Bob, I understand you're really close to making a decision, but I'm still not willing to go all the way to $11000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10900. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",10900.0,Alice,5,
