Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not desperate to sell. There's a chance I can get a slightly better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my desired value."
