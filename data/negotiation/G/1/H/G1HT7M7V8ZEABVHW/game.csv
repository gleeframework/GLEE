"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, $900,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $1,050,000? It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my target.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $975,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go below $1,025,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm definitely interested. How about we split the difference and close the deal at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
