Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, $900,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $1,050,000? It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need to get closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $975,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go below $1,025,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While $1,000,000 is a good price, I'm confident John will pay my desired $1,200,000. I've run out of time and I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal."
