"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which holds significant value for you at $15,000. I understand its importance to you and would like to propose a deal that benefits both of us. Considering the high value you place on this product, I am offering it to you for $12,000. This price not only ensures a fair transaction but also allows me to maintain a competitive edge in the market. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if there's any way I can assist you further. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000 and her value of $8,000. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a better price with Alice or resorting to buying from John at a lower price."
