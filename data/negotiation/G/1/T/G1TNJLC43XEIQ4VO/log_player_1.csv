Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $12,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but below your minimum ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning you'll list it publicly implies others might be interested, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and your negotiation skills, you might adjust the price slightly."
