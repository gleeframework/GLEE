"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This feels like a fair starting point, considering the value it brings to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value this product brings.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a significant asset for your company.  Let's continue this discussion and reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a significant investment for me.  How about $950,000? That's a substantial increase from my initial offer and reflects my seriousness about purchasing this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue working towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm prepared to lower my price to $975,000. This offer reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your financial considerations. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
