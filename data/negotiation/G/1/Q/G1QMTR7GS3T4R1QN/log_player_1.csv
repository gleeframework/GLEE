Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering slightly below Bob's perceived value allows room for potential counter-offers while still securing a substantial gain.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We know we have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so we don't want to go below that price.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, this strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob."
