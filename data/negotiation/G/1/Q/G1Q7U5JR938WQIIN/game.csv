"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. However, I have to consider my own interests as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering your own value for the product and the fact that I have another offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
