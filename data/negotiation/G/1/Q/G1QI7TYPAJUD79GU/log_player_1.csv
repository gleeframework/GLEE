{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,750,000 and has indicated this is his maximum.  It's unlikely further negotiation will significantly bridge the gap.  Accepting his offer means losing out on $25,000 compared to John's guaranteed offer.  

At this point, the certainty and lack of further negotiation with John outweigh the potential upside of continuing with Bob."
