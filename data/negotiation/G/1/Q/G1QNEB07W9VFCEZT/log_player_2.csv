"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would significantly benefit your business. Given its value and potential impact on your operations, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $14,000. This represents a substantial saving compared to the market value of $15,000, making it an excellent opportunity for you. Please let me know if you require any further information or have questions about the product. I look forward to hearing from you soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and cheaper than buying from John. While you could try to negotiate a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice would go lower and you risk losing the deal."
