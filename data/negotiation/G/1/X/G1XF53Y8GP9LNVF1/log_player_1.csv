(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price if I continue negotiating."

I'm going to stick with $10,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm confident that Bob will eventually accept as it's still a good deal for him. It's also my last chance to get this price before I have to settle for John's offer."
