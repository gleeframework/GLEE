# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe will be of great benefit to your business. My asking price is $950,000. This price reflects the significant value I know this product holds for you, while still allowing for a fair profit margin. I'm confident that this product will generate a substantial return on your investment. Please let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate a better price or proceed with buying from John and save $50,000."
