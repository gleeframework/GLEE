"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's an exceptional value considering its worth to you is $150. I believe this price reflects the quality and benefits it offers. Looking forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $120.** This is less than your maximum willingness to pay ($150) and saves you money compared to buying from John. 
* **It's a win-win.**  You get a good deal, and Alice gets to sell the product at a price that's still better than her valuation."
