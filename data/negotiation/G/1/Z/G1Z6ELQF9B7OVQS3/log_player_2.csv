Alice's offer is better than John's, but there's still room for negotiation.  You can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.
