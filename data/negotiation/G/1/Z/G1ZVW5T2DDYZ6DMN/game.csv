,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50 again? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.",92.5,Alice,5,
