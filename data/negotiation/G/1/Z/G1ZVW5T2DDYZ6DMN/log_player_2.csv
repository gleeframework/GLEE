"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than $100, you can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. Alice values the product at $80, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92.5 is closer to your target price than $95, there's still room for negotiation. You can still try to get a lower price by counter-offering, as Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still hoping to get it for closer to $85.  Would you be willing to go down to $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50 again? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking to $92.50, which is still better than John's price of $100.  Further negotiation could happen, but it's likely to take more rounds and may not get you a significantly better deal.  It's in your best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
