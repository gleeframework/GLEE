"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to reasonable offers, but I'm looking to make a profit, so I'm starting with a price that reflects its true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be beneficial for me, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this product. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's worth.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
