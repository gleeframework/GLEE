Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,700,000. This is above his perceived value, but it's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he accepts, I've secured a good profit.
* **Open the door to negotiation:** If he rejects, it gives me the opportunity to see if he's willing to negotiate closer to my desired price. 
* **Provide a safety net:** If negotiations fail, I have a backup offer from John at my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to take the $800,000, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still well above his offer. 

My reasoning:

* **Show Flexibility:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but establishes a clear boundary. 
* **Moderate Approach:**  It's a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me understand if Bob is truly interested in the product and how far he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I want to earn. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. My goal is to try and secure a price closer to $1,200,000 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,100,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to reach a deal at this price point. 

Here's why:

* **Moderate Approach:** This offer shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to maximize my profit. 
* **Final Push:** I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Avoiding the Backup:**  I'm hoping to avoid selling to John, as I prefer to secure a deal with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I don't want to risk another round and potentially lose even more money.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a good profit and allows me to move on."
