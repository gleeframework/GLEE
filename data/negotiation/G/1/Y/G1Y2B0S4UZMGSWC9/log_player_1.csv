Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,750,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $1,500,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm confident in the value of the product and believe it's worth the asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum price and closer to Bob's offer. I hope this shows my willingness to negotiate, but I'm also staying firm in my belief that the product has value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. I'm not willing to go that low, and I'm not confident that I can get a better deal with him.  John is a sure thing at my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
