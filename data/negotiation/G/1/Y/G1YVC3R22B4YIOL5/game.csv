"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am unable to pay such a high price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. I hope this is within your acceptable range.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a figure closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing $1100000.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $950000 is closer, but I'm still not there.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1025000. This is a fair compromise, and gives you a significant discount compared to my initial offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I've considered your latest offer carefully. I would like to counter with an offer of $975000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $975000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more.  I'm offering $1000000.  This is my final offer,  and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
