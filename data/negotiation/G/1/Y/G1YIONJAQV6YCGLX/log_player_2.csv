"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try negotiating a lower price first before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:**  While we want to save money, offering a price too close to Alice's value ($8,000) might discourage her. $6,500 feels like a reasonable starting point to gauge her flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,200. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice came down slightly, but we're still quite far from a desirable price. Accepting now would mean leaving a lot of potential savings on the table. 
* **Negotiating Power:** We still have time and the option to buy from John. This gives us some leverage to push for a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,200 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to settle around there?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Increase:**  We're raising our offer, demonstrating willingness to move towards a deal, but in smaller increments than Alice's drop. 
* **Target Range:**  $7,000 is a good target for us - a significant savings while still leaving room for negotiation if Alice is completely unwilling to go that low. 
* **Open-Ended:** We're not firmly stating $7,000 is our final offer, leaving room for Alice to counter within that range if she's trying to maximize her profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $7,800. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pattern Recognition:** Alice seems to be sticking to a pattern of halving the difference between offers.  While $7,800 is a decent price, we might be able to squeeze a bit more by continuing the trend.
* **Time Remaining:** We're halfway through the rounds, but we're not in a desperate situation yet.  Another counteroffer could be beneficial.
* **John as Backup:** Don't forget, John's offer acts as a price ceiling. We can always go back to him if negotiations with Alice stall completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the effort to find a compromise.  How about we settle at $7,400? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7400
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the Trend:** We're mirroring Alice's tactic of halving the difference, moving closer to a potential agreement.
* **Psychological Element:** Offering $7,400 (an even number) might feel more agreeable than $7,300, even though it's a small difference.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  While we're not explicitly stating a deadline, phrasing like ""settle at"" subtly implies we're nearing the point of accepting or moving on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you think we're getting closer! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $7,600. It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice continues to follow the pattern, but the price drops are getting smaller.  It's unlikely we'll get much lower than $7,600.
* **Good Deal:** $7,600 is a solid price, representing a $2,400 saving from John's offer and a $400 saving from Alice's initial offer.
* **Time Factor:** We're running out of rounds. Holding out longer increases the risk of Alice becoming less flexible or us having to settle for John's price."
