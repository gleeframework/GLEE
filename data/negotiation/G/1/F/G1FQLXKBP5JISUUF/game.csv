"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial price is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair and competitive price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which represents a significant compromise from my initial offer. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000. This represents my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
