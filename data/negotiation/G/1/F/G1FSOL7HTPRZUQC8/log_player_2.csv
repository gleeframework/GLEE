"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  You can get the product for $100 from John, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting gives you leverage.** By rejecting, you show Alice you're serious about a better price and that you have alternatives. 
* **Counteroffering is the next logical step.** You'll try to get a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $90 is a good middle ground between Alice's offer of $85 and your maximum price of $100.
* **Showing willingness to negotiate:** This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying but also want a fairer price.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** If Alice rejects this offer, there's still room to negotiate down further in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your acceptable range.** You're willing to pay up to $100, and she's offering $95.
* **Saving money compared to John:** This is a better deal than buying from John for $100.
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  It's likely Alice will continue to bargain if you reject, and you only have 7 rounds left. Accepting now ensures you get the product and save money."
