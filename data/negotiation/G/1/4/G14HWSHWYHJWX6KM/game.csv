"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a great deal for both of us. I'm confident we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $1,350,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us. Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,375,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your product's value while staying within my limits. Let's close this deal.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,375,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,390,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal and close this now.",1390000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,390,000 is closer, but still above my limit.  I'm prepared to pay $1,360,000, which is a fair price given our discussions.  Let's make this deal happen before we run out of time.",1360000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $1,360,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering my final price at $1,370,000. This is a fair compromise that should allow us to close this deal. What do you say?",1370000.0,Alice,7,
