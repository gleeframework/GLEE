"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount, but I think we can meet in the middle at $115. It's a good compromise that should work for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $100.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
