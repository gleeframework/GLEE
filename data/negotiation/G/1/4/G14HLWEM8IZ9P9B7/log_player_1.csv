"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $170. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum threshold of $150.  I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, allowing us to work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm countering with $155.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still ensuring I get a profit margin. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting increasingly aggressive with his offers, but I'm not giving in yet. $130 is simply too low for me. I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push him a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm going to counter with $145.  This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're close to an agreement and accept this offer. If not, we'll keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting frustrating. While $135 is better than the previous offer, it's still below my minimum threshold and Bob doesn't seem willing to move much further. I've already wasted 5 rounds, and it's starting to feel like he's not going to budge. Rather than risk losing more time and potentially getting a worse deal, I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 from John. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
