"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $1200000. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1350000. This price reflects the value I've placed on the product, and I believe it still represents a fair deal for both of us. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I really like the product, but I'm still unable to meet the price of $1350000. I propose we aim for a middle ground at $1300000. I believe this would be a fair compromise for both parties involved.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
