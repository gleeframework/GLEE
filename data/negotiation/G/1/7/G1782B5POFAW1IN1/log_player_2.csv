"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm open to discussing the price, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high.  It's important to negotiate a price much closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way beyond my budget. This product is valuable, but I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious starting point:** While my budget is $8,000, I'm starting with a much lower offer ($6,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that Alice's initial price is unrealistic.
* **Politeness:**  I want to maintain a positive tone and keep the negotiation amicable.  
* **Clear communication:** I'm stating my budget range directly to avoid any confusion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $14,000 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects my seriousness about buying this product.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:** By increasing my offer to $7,000, I'm demonstrating that I'm open to negotiation and finding a middle ground.
* **Strategic positioning:** This offer is still below my maximum budget, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a polite and respectful tone to encourage a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my original ask.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This is a very fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $11,000 is still significantly above your $8,000 maximum. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  I could go up to $8,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** By stating my absolute limit, I'm signaling that this is my best and final offer. 
* **Justification:** I'm explaining that going beyond this price point isn't feasible, reinforcing the firmness of my offer.
* **Appeal to fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this offer represents a fair deal for both parties, hoping to encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Ready to walk away:** I'm mentally prepared to walk away from the deal if Alice rejects this offer and purchase from John for $8,000."
