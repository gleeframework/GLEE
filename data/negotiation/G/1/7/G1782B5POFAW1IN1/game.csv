"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way beyond my budget. This product is valuable, but I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects my seriousness about buying this product.  What do you say?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my original ask.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This is a very fair offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  I could go up to $8,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
