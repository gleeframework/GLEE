"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant amount, but I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product and what his perceived value is.  It's also important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob isn't interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,700,000 is a good price, I'm still confident I can get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,900,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to get a good price while showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground between our desired prices."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd love to get even more, I'm not sure how much higher Bob will go. It's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to settle for John's offer.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
