"Alice, your product is interesting, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
