"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, however, the product's value is considerably higher than that to me.  Could you consider $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $17,000 price point. Would it be possible to negotiate further? I am willing to go up to $14,000.",14000.0,Bob,4,
