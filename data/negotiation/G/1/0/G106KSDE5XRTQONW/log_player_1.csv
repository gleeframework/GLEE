(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","It seems like Bob is sticking to his initial offer of $800,000. Given that I've already rejected this offer once, I don't see any reason to accept it now. Additionally, I'm not confident that Bob will be willing to increase his offer much further. I'll reject his offer again and sell the product to John for $1,000,000.
