"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower offer? I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your understanding of the product's value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I appreciate the adjustment, $1,125,000 is still out of my budget range. I would like to propose an offer of $1,000,000 if there's any possibility of flexibility on your end.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
