"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a decent discount from John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. A $10,000 offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation if she rejects. It's also a price that's a reasonable compromise, considering his maximum budget and Alice's minimum value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm eager to sell the product to you, $10000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Savings:**  $11,000 is still a good saving compared to John's $15,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, showing she's willing to compromise.
* **Risk:**  Rejecting and counteroffering again risks Alice walking away or holding firm at $11,000, leaving Bob with no better option than John's higher price.

At this point, accepting the offer is the best balance of saving money and minimizing risk."
