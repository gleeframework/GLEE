**Reasoning:** 

While we could continue negotiating, Bob seems anchored at $16,000 and unlikely to budge. Accepting this offer secures a $1,000 profit over John's offer. It's always possible to get more, but this feels like a reasonable point to settle, avoiding the risk of Bob walking away entirely."
