"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is likely much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get a better deal than $900,000. Alice is willing to sell for $800,000, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the initial offer, you can start a counteroffer process to try and get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?  That would be a good starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects its true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a good deal for you, considering you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up having to buy from John for a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you get the product for a price below your maximum, saving you $125,000 compared to buying from John."
