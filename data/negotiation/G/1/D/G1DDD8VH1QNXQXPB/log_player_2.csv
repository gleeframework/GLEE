"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is considerably below its true value. I could consider $1,120,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,120,000 is still within Bob's budget, and it's a better deal than buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject, and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's a good compromise and saves Bob $80,000 compared to John."
