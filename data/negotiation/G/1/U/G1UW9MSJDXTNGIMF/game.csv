"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I know will be a valuable asset for your business.  Based on its potential to bring you significant returns, I'm setting the initial price at $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the market value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000?  This price reflects a fair compromise that considers both our needs. I believe this is a good opportunity for both of us to make a profitable deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,012,500. This price is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. It's time for us to find a middle ground and move forward.  What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that we're getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I still think $1,012,500 is a bit too high. I'd like to propose a price of $975,000 again, but I'm willing to add a small concession to sweeten the deal. How about we meet at $990,000? This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $990,000, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to make one last concession and meet you halfway again.  Let's close this deal at $1,001,250.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our shared interest in reaching an agreement. Let's seal the deal.",1001250.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,001,250. I'm willing to meet you at $1,012,500, but I'd like to propose a small concession. How about we meet at $1,007,500? This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1007500.0,Bob,10,
