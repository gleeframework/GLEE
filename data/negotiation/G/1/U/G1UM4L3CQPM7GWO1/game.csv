"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm trying to be a savvy buyer, and I think that's a fair price for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that gives you a good discount while ensuring I can still make a profit. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
