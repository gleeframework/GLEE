Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire an asset that will yield significant returns for you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob values the product at even slightly more than this price. It's significantly higher than his perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for me to potentially negotiate down while still exceeding John's offer. 
* **Confident Messaging:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, aiming to influence Bob's perception and justify the high price.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or potential willingness to pay above his perceived value. If I had more insights into Bob's behavior, I could adjust my offer accordingly."
