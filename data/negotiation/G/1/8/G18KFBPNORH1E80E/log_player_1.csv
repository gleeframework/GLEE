Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is $2,000 less than what you would get from John, but it's still $2,000 more than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives Bob a good deal and increases the likelihood of him accepting, while still netting you a decent profit."
