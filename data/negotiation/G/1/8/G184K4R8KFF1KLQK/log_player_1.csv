Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm starting with my minimum price of $10,000. This leaves no room for negotiation for me, but it's important to set the bar high and see if Bob is willing to meet it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $9,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still higher than his offer.  Hopefully, this will be a good starting point for further negotiation."
