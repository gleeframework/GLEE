{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my value.  I'm proposing a price of $10,500. This gives us both a good deal, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, I'm still a bit away from my minimum price. Let's try $9,750. It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,600 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,600.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum value, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000. I'm also running out of rounds, and I want to close the deal."
