"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it could really benefit you. I'm asking for $20,000, which I believe reflects its true value.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $20,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below the market value of this product and what it offers you. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $17,000 is closer to my budget, it's still outside of my comfort zone.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $12,000.  Let's try to find a way to bridge this gap.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I need to be honest - $12,000 just doesn't reflect the value this product brings, especially for someone with your needs. I've already lowered my price considerably. To move this forward, I'm willing to consider $15,500. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $15,500 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $14,000 for this product, which is a significant compromise on my end. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to move on to another seller.",14000.0,Bob,6,
