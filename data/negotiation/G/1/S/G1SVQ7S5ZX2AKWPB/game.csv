"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my target. How about we try $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I think we're getting close to a fair price, so I'll meet you halfway between $10,250 and $11,000. How about we try $10,625?",10625.0,Alice,7,
