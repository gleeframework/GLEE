"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to do $8,500?  That's the absolute highest I'm willing to go.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? That way we both get a fair deal.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really looking to get this product for $8,250.  If you can come down to that, I'm ready to make a deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,250 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,500, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, I think it's a good compromise.",8500.0,Alice,5,
