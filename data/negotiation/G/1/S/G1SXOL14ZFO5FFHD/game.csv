"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be willing to consider $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm open to further negotiation, but $1,125,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise again - I'm willing to accept $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's true value, and it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
