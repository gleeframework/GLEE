"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm open to further negotiation, but $1,125,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise again - I'm willing to accept $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's true value, and it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice has come down to John's price.  There's no point in further negotiation at this point since it's unlikely she'll go any lower.  We can get the same price from John without further haggling."
