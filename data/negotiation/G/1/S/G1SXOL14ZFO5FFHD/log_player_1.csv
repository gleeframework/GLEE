"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I believe I can get a better price, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be willing to consider $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, and I'm confident I can secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to further negotiation, but $1,125,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise again - I'm willing to accept $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's true value, and it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
