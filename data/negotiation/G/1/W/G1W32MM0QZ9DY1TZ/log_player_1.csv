I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for this product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering the price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than my minimum.  John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'll sell to him."
