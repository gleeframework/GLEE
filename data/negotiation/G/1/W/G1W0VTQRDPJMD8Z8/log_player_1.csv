Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, I may be willing to negotiate the price closer to $10,000 to ensure a sale."
