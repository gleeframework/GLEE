{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on investment for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be more competitive. I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,800,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than my minimum acceptable price.  I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. It holds significant potential beyond what you might be currently estimating. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,800,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $2,100,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2100000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's potential, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be more aggressive. I'm proposing a price of $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're getting closer, but $1,950,000 is still under my absolute minimum. I'm willing to play hardball a little longer to see if I can get closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $2,050,000? This recognizes the true value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more aggressive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Bob's latest offer indicates he's unlikely to significantly increase his price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming increasingly risky to lose a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  Therefore, I'm choosing to cut off negotiations with Bob and sell to John."
