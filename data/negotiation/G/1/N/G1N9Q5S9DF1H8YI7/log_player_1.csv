"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm confident Bob will be interested as the product is worth $120 to him, and I'm only asking for $20 more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is a good deal for me.  It's more than my minimum price of $120, and we're already in round 2. There's no guarantee that we'll be able to reach a better agreement in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal by being too greedy."
