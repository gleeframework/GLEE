{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000.  It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant profit for me, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **The message** is friendly and professional, emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

This offer balances the need to maximize my profit with the possibility of losing the deal and having to settle with John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired $1,250,000 mark.  This will involve finding a compromise point that is both attractive to Bob and still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects a significant discount for you, and it's the best I can offer at this time.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a compromise. It's a lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still closer to my desired price than Bob's. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the ""significant discount"" Bob is getting, making the offer seem appealing.  It also aims to push for a final decision by highlighting the ""middle ground"" compromise. 
* **Strategic Aim:**  By rejecting Bob's initial counteroffer and making a counteroffer of my own, I demonstrate that I am serious about negotiating a deal. This helps ensure that Bob doesn't try to lowball me further.

**Next Steps:**

The outcome of this counteroffer will determine the next steps:

* **If Bob accepts:** The deal is finalized, and I earn $1,150,000.
* **If Bob rejects:** I will need to decide whether to accept his next counteroffer or make another counteroffer.  I will continue to analyze the situation and adjust my offers strategically to maximize my profit while still considering the risk of losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I still believe we can reach a better agreement. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,080,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with the value you're placing on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still too low for me to consider selling the product.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price closer to its value. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. This will show flexibility while still holding firm on a price that reflects the product's value.
* **Strategic Aim:**  I'll continue to carefully analyze Bob's offers and responses. The goal is to secure the best possible price without risking losing the deal entirely.
* **Consider Selling to John:** If Bob continues to reject my offers and the negotiation stalls, I'll need to seriously consider selling the product to John for $1,000,000.  While this is not my ideal scenario, it's important to weigh the potential loss against the risk of prolonging negotiations without a guarantee of a better outcome."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to accept $1,120,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1120000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $1,120,000 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's latest offer of $1,080,000.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and suggesting a mutually beneficial solution.  
* **Strategic Aim:** By moving closer to Bob's price, I show flexibility and a genuine desire to reach a deal. However, the price is still significantly higher than John's offer, giving me a reasonable margin of profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:** If Bob accepts my counteroffer, the deal is finalized, and I earn $1,120,000.
* **Rejecting My Offer:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I need to assess whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John. I'll need to consider the likelihood of securing a better price with Bob, the time spent negotiating, and the potential loss by selling to John."
