"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss something around $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $500000 is far below the product's true value.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This gives you a substantial discount, but still reflects the product's worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget, $800000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm prepared to make one more concession.  How about we settle on $1250000?  This price acknowledges your budget constraints while ensuring I can make a fair profit.
