"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have a backup option with John, so you're not under immediate pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting low to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  I'm offering a price that's below my maximum budget but still potentially profitable for Alice.  If she rejects, we can continue negotiating in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. I'm willing to go slightly higher than my initial counteroffer, but I'm not yet at a price I'm comfortable with.  I'll reject and counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still keeping it below John's price.  This is a good middle ground, and hopefully Alice will accept to avoid further rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is still above my ideal price, it's getting closer to my maximum budget.  With only 5 rounds left, and the risk of John's offer disappearing, it's a good time to accept.  It's likely that Alice won't go any lower, and I'm still saving money compared to John."
