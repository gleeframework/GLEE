"Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this fantastic product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm offering it for $2,000,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional asset.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the introduction. While the product is impressive, the price point doesn't align with my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer.  While I understand your position, $800,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of this asset.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a significant gap from what I can consider. To be frank, anything over $1,000,000 isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but the price needs to reflect a realistic valuation.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty. I want to be upfront â€“ I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions. My final offer is $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal with you.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but that price is still a stretch for me. I value your time, but I'm only able to justify a price closer to $1,100,000.  If we can't find an agreement there, I might have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
