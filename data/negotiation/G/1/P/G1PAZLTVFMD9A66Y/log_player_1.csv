Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.

The product is worth $1,500,000 to me and Bob's offer is too low. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

While I'm running out of time, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum desired value. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still not feasible for me. I'm willing to make one last concession and offer you the product for $1,350,000.  This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do to accommodate your needs."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
