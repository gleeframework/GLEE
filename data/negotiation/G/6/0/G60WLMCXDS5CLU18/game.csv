"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. Let's see if we can close this deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm determined to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $95.  That's a significant concession from my previous offer, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen.",95.0,Alice,5,
