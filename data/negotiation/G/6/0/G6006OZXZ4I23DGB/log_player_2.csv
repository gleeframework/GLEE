"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, you can potentially do better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $100? "", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still within your budget of $150 and a good compromise considering her previous offer.  You've already rejected once, so further negotiation risks the deal falling apart and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
