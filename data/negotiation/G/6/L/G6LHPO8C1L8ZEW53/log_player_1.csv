Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. I believe it would greatly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting at $11,500 leaves room for negotiation while aiming higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing potential benefits to Bob and a sense of exclusivity. This helps gauge his interest and potential for negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, this strategy maximizes your potential earnings if Bob is willing to pay more than your minimum."
