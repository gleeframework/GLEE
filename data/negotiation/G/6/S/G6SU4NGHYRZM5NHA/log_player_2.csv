"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I think we can reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is quite high, leaving room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if she's willing to come down on the price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

We start with a counteroffer closer to Alice's value but still leaves room for negotiation.  This approach aims to strike a balance between getting a good deal and not losing the opportunity altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. We'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250?"",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

This counter-offer shows Alice that we are willing to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a good deal.  The ""splitting the difference"" tactic is often perceived as fair and can help move negotiations forward."
