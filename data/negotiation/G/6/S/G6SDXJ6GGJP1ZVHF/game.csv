"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, given its value to me.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,500,000 represents my initial assessment of the product's value, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000. I believe this price point acknowledges its worth while providing you with significant value.",1425000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,425,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's find a way to make this deal work.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
