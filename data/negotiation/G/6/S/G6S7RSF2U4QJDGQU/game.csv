"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
