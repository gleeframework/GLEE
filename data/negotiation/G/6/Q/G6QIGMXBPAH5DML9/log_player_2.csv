{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting closer to my acceptable range, but I still believe I can get a slightly lower price.  There are only three rounds left, so I need to be more aggressive.  I'll reject her offer and make one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm making my final counteroffer at $60. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to come close to her price but not go above my limit. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll go with John, as there's only one round left."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to $63, which is very close to my desired price. With only one round left, it's not worth risking a further negotiation.  I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price."
