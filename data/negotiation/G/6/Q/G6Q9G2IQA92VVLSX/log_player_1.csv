```

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum.  This allows for some negotiation space while still maximizing your potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $12,000, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. I'll counteroffer to see if I can secure a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $13,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting and getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not at my ideal price. I will counteroffer again to see if I can get a bit closer to my target."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $13,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,250.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm running the risk of continuing this negotiation and not being able to secure a better price.  John has already offered my minimum, so I'm going to sell to John to avoid any further potential losses."
