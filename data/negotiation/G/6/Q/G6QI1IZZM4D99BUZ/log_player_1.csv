"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer and gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm counteroffering at $140.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility but still leaving room for some profit. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $110 is still a decent price, I feel like I can get closer to my initial offer. There are still rounds left, so I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $130. This is a further compromise, but still leaves me with a comfortable profit.  With only 5 rounds left, I'm aiming to find a price that both Bob and I can agree on, avoiding the risk of having to sell to John for the lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is only slightly above my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price.  I'm not sure how willing Bob is to negotiate further, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering at $115. This is my final attempt to reach a compromise with Bob before selling to John. It's a significant decrease from my previous offer, but it's still higher than John's offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob.  He's clearly not willing to pay more than $100, and I've already made several concessions.  To ensure I don't end up with nothing, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $100."
