"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This would be a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit. Let's find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you and my desired profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet me halfway, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that $14,000 would be a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to bridge this gap and make this deal happen.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500. This is as close as I can get to your desired price while still meeting my own minimum requirements. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,5,
