Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the product with you, Alice. However, $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned it holds to you.
