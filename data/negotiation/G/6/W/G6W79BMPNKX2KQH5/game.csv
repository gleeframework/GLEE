"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. While I understand $65 is your current offer, I'm unable to go that low. My product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it would be a great investment for you. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to continue working with you.",90.0,Alice,3,

I appreciate you working with me Alice.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $77.50?,77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $77.50 is still too low for me.  I'm confident this product can be extremely valuable to you, and I want to ensure we find a price that reflects that. Let's try $85. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach an agreement that benefits both of us. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I need to be budget conscious.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $81.25?",81.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $81.25 is still not quite right for me.  I've thought about it, and I'm willing to come down to $87.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it will be a great investment for you.  Let's close this deal and make it happen!",87.5,Alice,7,
