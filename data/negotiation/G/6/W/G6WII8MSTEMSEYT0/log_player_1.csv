"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done some research, and I think the product is worth $1,250,000 to me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $1,250,000 is still below my minimum, and I have a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. I can always make up the difference by selling to John if this deal falls through."
