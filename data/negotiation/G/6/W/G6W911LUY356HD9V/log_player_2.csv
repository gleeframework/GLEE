Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is your final attempt to reach a compromise with Alice. You've already made a counteroffer of $120 in round 6 and Alice rejected it. You're now offering the same price again to signal your willingness to settle.  You're only two rounds away from having to buy from John, so it's a high-risk, high-reward situation. If Alice rejects this offer, you'll have to decide whether to buy from John in the next round."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round. You've already made several counteroffers and Alice has not budged. Alice's offer of $130 is still above your desired price point.  You only have one round left, and buying from John for $150 guarantees you get the product, though at a higher price. It's better to buy from John than to risk getting no deal at all."
