"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer to get the ball rolling. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $18,000. What do you think?

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you consider $10,000? That feels like a fair starting point."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $14,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?

Round 4

""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be open to $11,000? That's a reasonable compromise, in my opinion."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can see that you're serious about making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident that you'll find the product valuable enough to be worth it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $11,500 and $13,000. I'll sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $12,500. You can get the product for $12,000 from John. It makes more sense to cut your losses and secure the product at the lower price rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
