I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer to get the ball rolling.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you consider $10,000? That feels like a fair starting point.
