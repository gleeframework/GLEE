"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,500,000 is still lower than what I'm hoping for, and I have more rounds to negotiate.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's. I want to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product and won't settle for too low a price. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $1,600,000 isn't my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering.  I've made some progress in negotiations, and continuing to push for a higher price risks losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk ending up with John's lower offer."
