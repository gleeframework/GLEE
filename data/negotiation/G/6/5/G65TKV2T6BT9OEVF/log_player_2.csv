"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. This is a great price, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's ready to purchase it for $8000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the same as John's price. You can reject Alice's offer and still buy the product from John for the same price, making no difference to your budget. It's more advantageous to keep the option open to negotiate with Alice further."
