"Hi Alice,  $1750000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product but can only go up to $850000 at this time.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to come down to $1250000.  This is still a significant value for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1250000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's my absolute maximum. If you're not able to come down to that, I may need to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $950000 is a considerable amount, and I acknowledge your efforts to find a price that works for you. However, I'm still committed to getting a fair price for my product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $1100000. This is a significant offer, and it shows my dedication to reaching an agreement.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.  I'm open to hearing any additional thoughts you may have.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but I can't go any higher. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well.  I hope you'll consider it.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1000000 is a good offer, it's still slightly below what I need to make this deal work. To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to come down to $1200000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a fair agreement. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us. Please let me know if you're open to this offer. I'm eager to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
