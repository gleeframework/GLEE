"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today.  I think it's incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly.  To give you a fair deal, I'm initially offering it for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? ",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I want to find a price that works for us both, I can't go as low as $12,000.  Would you consider $15,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,
