Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product at a discounted price of $11,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price, and would hate for you to miss out."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob could lead to a larger profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing me to still potentially secure a deal above my minimum.
* **Strategic Discount:** The message highlights a ""discounted price,"" potentially making the offer more appealing to Bob.

This approach balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential for increased earnings."
