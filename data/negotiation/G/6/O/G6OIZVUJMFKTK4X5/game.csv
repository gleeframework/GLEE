"Bob, I have a very special product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is not quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's try $1350000. This is a fair price considering the value this product offers, and it allows us both to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counter with $1275000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable with, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
