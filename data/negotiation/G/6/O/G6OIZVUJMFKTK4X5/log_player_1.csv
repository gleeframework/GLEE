{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very special product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is not quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's try $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product offers, and it allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counter with $1275000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable with, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection. I also have the option to sell to John, but accepting Bob's offer secures a higher price."
