Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is very close to my desired price. While I would like to have gotten closer to $100,  $95 is still a good deal for me and a better outcome than selling to John for $80.  I'll accept his offer."
