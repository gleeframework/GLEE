"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to offer $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $15,000. This is still a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to me, and it's closer to what I can afford.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $15,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $14,500. This is still a good deal, considering the value it will bring to your business, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",14500.0,Alice,5,
