"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's well above my maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to offer $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $15,000. This is still a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to me, and it's closer to what I can afford."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $15,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $14,500. This is still a good deal, considering the value it will bring to your business, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $14,500.  While this is still above my preferred price point, it's only $2,500 above my budget.  It's worth taking this deal, as I'm unlikely to get a much lower price from Alice, and I don't want to risk going back and forth for too long only to end up buying from John."
