"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth even more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value can subtly influence Bob's perception.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial high price makes it clear that I'm willing to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below my initial asking price. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about negotiating a higher price and not willing to settle quickly.  We're only in round two, so there's plenty of room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is considerably below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,550,000? This takes into account the value it offers you while still reflecting its worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Counter:** I want to acknowledge Bob's offer to show I'm engaged in the negotiation but hold firm on getting a better price. 
* **Strategic Concession:** I've decreased my asking price by $50,000, showing a willingness to negotiate, but it's a calculated move, not a drastic drop. 
* **Value Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's value aims to nudge Bob closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a strong deal. It's a significant profit over my guaranteed sale to John ($1,200,000) and shows that Bob is serious about purchasing the product. While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's also the risk that Bob could walk away if I keep pushing. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
