"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a product that's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still looking to get as close to my target price as possible. With that in mind, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value of the product to both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still allows you to get a fair price for the product.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
