,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $115? That gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant at $105. How about we split the difference and settle at $110? That seems like a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $102.50 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",102.5,Bob,6,
