"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $875,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $800,000.
* **It's a good deal for Bob:** While Bob could potentially get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, there's no guarantee.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a reasonable price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob keeps rejecting and counteroffering, there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the negotiation or offer a higher price."
