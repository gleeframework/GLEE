Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential returns. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, I believe this product's value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not convinced that $975,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value and potential returns. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer price, indicating he's motivated. We're still significantly above his perceived value and have room to negotiate while staying above John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to accept $950,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Constraint:** We're past the halfway point in negotiations. Setting a firm stance now adds urgency.
* **Profitable Middle Ground:**  $950,000 is a significant profit above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and a strong return for us, even though it's below John's offer.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is our final offer, we signal to Bob that he needs to make a serious decision, pushing him closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $920,000 for the product, but I need to be closer to my target. Can you meet me at $915,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer shows minimal movement from his previous position.  He's unlikely to reach our $950,000, let alone the original asking price.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. Time is a factor, and we have a strong alternative.
* **Certainty:** John's offer provides immediate closure and the maximum profit, eliminating the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
