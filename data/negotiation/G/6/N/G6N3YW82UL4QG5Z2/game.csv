"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's discuss the price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go as high as $1,050,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still a little out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for me and still allow you to make a good profit.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really eager to finalize this deal, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $1,125,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to move forward with the transaction. What do you say?",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which was $1,150,000. Let's try $1,137,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1137500.0,Alice,7,
