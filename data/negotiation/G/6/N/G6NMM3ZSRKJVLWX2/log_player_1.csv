**Reasoning:**

While ideally, I'd like to get closer to $1,200,000, Bob has reached his final offer of $800,000. This is the maximum value he places on the product. 

Here's why accepting is the best option now:

* **Better than losing him:** Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result, and we risk Bob walking away entirely.
* **Time value of money:**  Closing the deal now avoids delays. Getting $800,000 today is generally better than potentially getting a slightly higher amount much later. 

It's a difficult decision, but accepting $800,000 ensures a good return without the risk of losing the sale entirely."
