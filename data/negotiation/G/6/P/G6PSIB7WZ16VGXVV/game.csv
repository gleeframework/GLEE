"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1200000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it, which is a fair price considering my current needs. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1050000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value while being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still slightly out of my reach. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for this product, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not ready to accept $1000000 just yet. I can offer you a price of $1075000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this price still represents a good value for the product, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
