Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my current needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1050000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value while being more in line with your budget. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still slightly out of my reach. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for this product, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not ready to accept $1000000 just yet. I can offer you a price of $1075000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this price still represents a good value for the product, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is not willing to come down to my maximum price of $1,000,000.  I've already rejected two of her offers, and it seems like she's unwilling to budge.  Rather than risk going through more rounds of negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a price higher than my budget, I'm going to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This guarantees I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
