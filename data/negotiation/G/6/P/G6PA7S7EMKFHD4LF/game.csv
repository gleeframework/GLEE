"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $15,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be just as valuable to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering its worth and the fact that I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!",16000.0,Alice,1,
