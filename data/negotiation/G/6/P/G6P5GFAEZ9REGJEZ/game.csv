"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to go up to $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $14,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",14000.0,Bob,4,
