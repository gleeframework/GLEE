Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,750,000. Let me know your decision, as I do have another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start higher to probe Bob's willingness to pay a premium.  
* **Justification for the price:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, creating a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Time pressure:**  Mentioning another interested party creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offer is $1,750,000, there's some flexibility if Bob tries to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a chance to purchase a product he clearly values."
