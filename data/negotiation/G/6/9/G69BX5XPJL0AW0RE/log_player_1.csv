Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, we'll see where he stands and negotiate from there.  John's offer provides a safety net if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price. I'm not willing to accept such a low price, but I'm also not ready to sell to John yet.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob, but I'm also prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to John's offer that it's worth accepting.  I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, but I'm not sure how much further I can push Bob. This is a good compromise."
