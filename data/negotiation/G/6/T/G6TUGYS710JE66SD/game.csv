"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit over budget.  Would you be willing to do $105?  That's the absolute most I can do.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $105. How about we compromise at $115? I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit too much.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I truly appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $115 is still a bit more than I can spend right now.  Let's split the difference at $110 -  that's the absolute maximum I can do.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to move on to another seller.",110.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to make a final compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit too much more. How about we meet at $112? It's a small increase, but it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",112.0,Alice,7,
