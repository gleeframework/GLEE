Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $10,000. I'll counter with a price that's more in line with my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  That's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gets me closer to my minimum."", ""product_price"": 10000}
