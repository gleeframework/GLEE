Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible while still making a profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting us closer to our desired profit margin.
* **Time Value:** While we have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays or complications.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
