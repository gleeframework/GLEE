This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a successful sale. Here's why:

* **Profit:** This offer nets me $250,000 in profit, which is a significant amount. 
* **Likelihood of Acceptance:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so a price of $1,450,000 is likely within his acceptable range, especially since rejecting the offer means he loses out entirely. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects, I still have John who is willing to pay my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money."
