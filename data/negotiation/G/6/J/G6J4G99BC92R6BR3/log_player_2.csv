Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm offering the product to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $110.  You have a guaranteed option for $100 from John, so it makes more sense to take that deal."
