"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1250000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering my maximum budget and the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1250000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1350000? This gives us both some room to compromise and allows me to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm happy to hear you're willing to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1300000. This would be a mutually beneficial deal, and I'm confident we can finalize it quickly.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
