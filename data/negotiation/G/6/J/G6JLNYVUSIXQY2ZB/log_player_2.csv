"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a decent price, I can aim for a better deal.  I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering my maximum budget and the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1250000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1350000? This gives us both some room to compromise and allows me to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still willing to hold out for a bit.  I'll reject Alice's offer and continue to negotiate.  If she doesn't budge further, I'll consider buying from John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to hear you're willing to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1300000. This would be a mutually beneficial deal, and I'm confident we can finalize it quickly."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. Let's try $1325000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our positions. I believe this is the closest we can get to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,325,000, which is within my budget and not that far off from my last counteroffer. It's getting risky to continue negotiating, especially since I can always buy from John for $1,200,000.  This feels like a reasonable compromise, and it's better to secure the product now than risk losing it."
