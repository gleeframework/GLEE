I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a fair price that leaves room for negotiation but still ensures I make a profit significantly higher than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than his counteroffer. I'm hoping this price will be acceptable to him while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
