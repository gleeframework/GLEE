"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low.  $950,000 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still cannot justify spending more than $950,000 on this product. I would like to propose one last offer of $975,000. I hope this is within your consideration.",975000.0,Bob,4,
