"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is much higher than both my limit ($120) and John's price ($120). I should make a counteroffer to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable range. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Polite & Direct:** I maintain a polite and respectful tone while clearly stating my price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but $140 is still above my maximum budget of $120 and John's offer. I need to hold firm and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the product has value, Alice, but $140 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $110? It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy at that price."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing Incrementally:** I increased my offer to show willingness to negotiate but kept it below my $120 limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating I'm ""ready to buy,"" I'm adding a bit of pressure and signaling that this is a serious offer. 
* **Staying Firm:** While I'm compromising, I'm still aiming for a price that saves me money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price. $125 is my final offer â€“ it's a really good deal for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Alice has come down considerably, and $125 is only slightly above John's offer of $120. 
* **""Final Offer"":** Alice's language suggests she's unlikely to move much lower. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has limited potential upside ($5 savings) but risks losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure a reasonable price now."
