Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,200,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,200,000 allows Bob to still gain a substantial profit ($300,000) while you secure a significant amount above your baseline.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below $800,000. This allows for some risk in aiming high with Bob."
