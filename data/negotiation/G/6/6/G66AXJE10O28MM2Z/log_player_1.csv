Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,350,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal. 
* **High Anchor:** By starting with a high but reasonable offer, we set a strong anchor point for the negotiation, making it more likely Bob will counter with an offer closer to our desired range.

**Important:**  While John provides a safety net at $1,000,000, the primary focus is maximizing profit with Bob."
