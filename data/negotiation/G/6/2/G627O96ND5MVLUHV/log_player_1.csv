Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I see the value in this product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and would allow me to proceed with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me, considering my budget.  Let's try $875,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my price range.  I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.
