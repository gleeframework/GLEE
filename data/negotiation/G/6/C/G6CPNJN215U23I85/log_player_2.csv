You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

```

Since the product is worth $12,000 to you and Alice is willing to sell for $12,000, there's no immediate benefit to accepting her offer. You can try to negotiate a lower price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good deal. It's lower than John's price of $12,000 and still higher than Alice's minimum of $10,000. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a price within your budget and saves you $500 compared to buying from John."
