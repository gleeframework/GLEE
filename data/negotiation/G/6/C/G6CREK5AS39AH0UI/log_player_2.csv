"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her value of $800,000.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but $925,000 is still higher than my ideal. Since I have a backup option with John, I'm not under pressure to accept her offer. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal given the product's value to you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back to her original offer of $900,000.  While I would prefer a lower price, it's important to consider:

* **Alice is unlikely to go lower:** She's already made several concessions.
* **John's price is significantly higher:** Buying from John would cost me $600,000 more.

Accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point. It's a fair price, and it saves me a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
