"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $15,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,000 and $16,500. Would you consider selling the product to me for $15,750?",15750.0,Bob,4,
