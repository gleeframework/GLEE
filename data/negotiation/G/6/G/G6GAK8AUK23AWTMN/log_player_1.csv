Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $100, but leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal since the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is close to my desired price and still above my minimum, so accepting his offer is the best decision in this case."
