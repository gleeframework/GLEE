"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is still well above Bob's value of $800,000 but gives him room to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us, encouraging a collaborative approach.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going for the full $1,200,000 right away, as it's more likely Bob will counteroffer and we can work towards a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $950,000 for your product. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is closer, but still below my value:**  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I can still do better. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to make a counteroffer that gets us closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is too risky:** While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, there's still a chance I can get closer to that value with Bob.  The risk of losing the deal with Bob isn't worth it at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and is fair for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This shows willingness to compromise and signals I'm taking his counteroffer seriously.
* **Maintaining my advantage:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm still staying above Bob's initial value. This gives me some leverage in the negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing that we can both benefit from a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and while it's closer, I'd like to propose $960,000 as the purchase price for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product and our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is getting close:** We're now only $15,000 apart, and I've already lowered my price significantly. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might get me a slightly higher price, but it's risky.  The longer we go, the more likely Bob could walk away, or I might get too aggressive and lose the deal entirely.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me confidence that $960,000 is a reasonable outcome. It's a good deal for me, and it avoids the risk of further negotiations."
