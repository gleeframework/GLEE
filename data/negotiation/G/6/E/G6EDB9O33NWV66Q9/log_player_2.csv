"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $11,500 is a good price for Bob, and it's still a good deal for Alice. It's better than buying from John for $15,000."
