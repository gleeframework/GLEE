"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $8,750. Can you consider this price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
