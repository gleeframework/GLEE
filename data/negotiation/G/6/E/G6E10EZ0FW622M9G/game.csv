"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $800,000 to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but  $750,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $700,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to seal the deal. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,
