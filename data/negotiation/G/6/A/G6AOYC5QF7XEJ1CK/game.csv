"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1125000?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1125000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. How about we try $1075000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. But $1075000 is simply too low for me. To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to drop my price to $1100000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to go up to $1075000, but I need you to meet me at that price. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
