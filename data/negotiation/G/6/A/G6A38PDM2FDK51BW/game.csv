"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product, which I believe holds immense value. My starting price is $1500000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This reflects the value I place on the product, while remaining fair to you.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1175000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and your budget.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1175000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's finalize this deal!",1150000.0,Bob,6,
