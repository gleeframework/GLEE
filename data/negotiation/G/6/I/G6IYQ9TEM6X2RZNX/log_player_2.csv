Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $142. I'm willing to meet you at $147, which is still a great deal for you. It's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $147. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice has indicated she won't go lower.  While we could try another counteroffer, it's unlikely to yield a better result than $147. Accepting this offer saves us $3 compared to John's price."
