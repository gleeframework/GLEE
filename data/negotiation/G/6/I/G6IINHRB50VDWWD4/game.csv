"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $760,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $795,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",795000.0,Alice,5,
