"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, however, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However,  $1,300,000 is still outside of my budget. I could meet you halfway from our previous offers. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you finding middle ground. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. To make this work, I'm willing to accept $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
