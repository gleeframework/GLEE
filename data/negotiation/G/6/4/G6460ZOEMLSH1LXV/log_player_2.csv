"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs and expectations. Given its high value to you, we believe it's worth every penny of its true worth, which stands at $10,000. However, I understand that transactions often benefit from mutual agreement, so I propose a special introductory price of $9,500 for you. This offer includes a comprehensive warranty and exceptional customer support to ensure your satisfaction. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your budget and preferences, or if you need any further information to make an informed decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above your maximum budget and significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or simply proceed with purchasing from John at a better price."
