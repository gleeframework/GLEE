"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming for a significant discount, starting at $11,000 which is still above Alice's value but well below his own. 
* **Fairness:**  This counteroffer is still a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's still room for both sides to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $12000. It's still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $12,000 is a better offer than the previous round, he can likely still negotiate further. Rejecting the offer will give Bob the opportunity to make another counteroffer and try to get closer to his desired price of $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for $12,000.  Let's split the difference. How about $11,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob is now offering a price that's halfway between Alice's last offer and his previous counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness:** $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob, and it's likely a price Alice would be willing to accept.
* **Pressure:** By offering a specific price, Bob is putting the pressure on Alice to make a decision."
