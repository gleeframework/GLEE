Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately alienating Bob. 
* **The message:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value he'll receive. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
 
**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a higher price, but leaving room for negotiation to encourage Bob to counter-offer. This keeps the conversation going and allows me to gauge his interest and willingness to pay.
* I have the option of selling to John at any time, so I'm not under extreme pressure to make concessions quickly. This gives me a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking of something around $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below his own perceived value of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and try to negotiate a more favorable price. I'm confident that I can achieve a better deal, as my fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000 gives me strong leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a bit low, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value of the product for you, and it's still a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility. It's also still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **The message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate the value of the product.  I'm using a positive tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

* I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a position that's beneficial to me.
* This counteroffer is likely to elicit a response from Bob, allowing us to continue the negotiation process.
*  I'm prepared to accept John's offer if Bob continues to be unreasonable, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my initial offer, $950,000 is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for a price that is far below what I perceive as the product's worth, especially when I have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue the negotiation process and counteroffer with a price closer to $1,100,000.  I'm confident that I can reach a more acceptable price with Bob or, if necessary, I'll move forward with selling to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $950,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This reflects the value you'll receive from the product while allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,025,000:** This price is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's latest offer of $950,000. This demonstrates flexibility and shows that I'm committed to reaching an agreement. 
* **The message:** I'm highlighting the value Bob will get from the product, framing it as a win-win situation. I'm also encouraging a quick decision to close the deal.

**Strategy:**

* I'm using a strategy of gradual concessions to keep the negotiation moving forward. 
* I'm aiming to find a price that's acceptable to both parties while still maximizing my profit. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John, so I have a strong fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than what I perceive the product's worth to be.  I've already made multiple concessions, and it seems clear that Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more reliable buyer.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who has proven to be a difficult negotiator."
