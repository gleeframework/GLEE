{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room for bargaining.  It also emphasizes the value of the product to me to potentially pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to try to get a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your offer. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
