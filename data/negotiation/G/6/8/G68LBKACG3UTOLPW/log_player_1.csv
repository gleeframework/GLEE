Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply not feasible for me.  This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident it will generate significant returns for you. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that John is a reliable option. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob before committing to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm not trying to be unreasonable, but this product has a proven track record and will bring you significant value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $975,000, and I'm willing to make a deposit to secure the deal. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm confident that it will be a good investment. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to accept it. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, and I'm confident I can get Bob to at least match that, or even better, with a few more rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $975,000 is still too low for me. I'm not willing to give up on a better deal. Let's close this now. If you're serious about making this deal, I'll meet you at $990,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 990000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to maximize your profit, but $990,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last serious offer. I'll meet you at $980,000, and I'm willing to make a deposit to secure the deal. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer of $980,000 is very close to my minimum, but I'm running out of time and John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000.  I'll take the safe bet and sell to John."
