Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm and the unique nature of the product, $1800000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  I'm confident this is still a fair price considering the value you place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
