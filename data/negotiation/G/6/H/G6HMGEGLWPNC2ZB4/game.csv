"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, it's worth $150 to me. Considering its worth to you is $100, I'm confident this is a great opportunity for both of us. I propose we strike a deal at $120. This way, you get a valuable item at a slight premium over its perceived value, while I receive a fair return for my investment. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
