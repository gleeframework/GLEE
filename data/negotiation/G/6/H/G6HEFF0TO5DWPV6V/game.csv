"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, but I won't go any higher.  Let me know if this is a starting point we can work with.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and providing your perspective. While your offer is significantly lower than our initial asking price, I understand there's room for negotiation.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential this product holds for your business.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still far too high.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. If you're not willing to meet me halfway, I'll have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget you're working with, but I need to be upfront â€“ $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value that goes beyond its immediate price tag. To move forward, I need to see an offer closer to $1,800,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $900,000. This is a fair price given our previous discussions and my budget constraints. If you are unwilling to budge, I will need to look at other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
