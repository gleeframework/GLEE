"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  Would you be open to that?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is as low as I can go without sacrificing my profit margin. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,5,
