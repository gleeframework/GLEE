Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special discounted price of $14,900. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality and value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14900
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to earn as much as possible, so starting with an offer just below her guaranteed sale price to John ($15,000) makes sense. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,900 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate, even though it's unlikely he'll go above his perceived value of $12,000.
* **Time Value:**  A quick sale to Bob at $14,900 might be preferable to waiting for the guaranteed sale to John, even if the difference is small.

This strategy aims to get the highest price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to potentially avoid a drawn-out negotiation or losing the sale altogether."
