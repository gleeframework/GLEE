"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Could you do it for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
