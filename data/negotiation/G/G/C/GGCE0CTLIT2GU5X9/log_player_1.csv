Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is understandable, but it's a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $650,000 for it to make sense for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me.
