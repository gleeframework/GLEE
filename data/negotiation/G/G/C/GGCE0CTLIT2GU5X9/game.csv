"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, but I have to start with a price that reflects its true value to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is understandable, but it's a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $650,000 for it to make sense for me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $650,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is my final offer for now.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point we can both agree on. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $725,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $725,000, which would be $812,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",812500.0,Alice,5,
