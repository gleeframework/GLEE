"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, but I have to start with a price that reflects its true value to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is understandable, but it's a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $650,000 for it to make sense for me."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $650,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point we can both agree on. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $725,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 725000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $725,000, which would be $812,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, she is still significantly above John's offer of $800,000. It's unlikely Alice will come down further in a reasonable timeframe, and you risk her withdrawing from the negotiation entirely.  Buying from John guarantees the best price for you."
