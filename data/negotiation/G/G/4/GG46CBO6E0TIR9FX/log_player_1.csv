Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above the product's value to Bob, hoping to secure a good starting point for negotiation.  I want to leave room for compromise, but also ensure I maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I want to close the deal, I can't accept such a low price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $750,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price given the value of the product to both of us. Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit too low. I'm confident that I can push for a better price in the next round, as I still have time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer.  How about $825,000? It's a fair compromise for both of us, and a good price for a product you value at $800,000. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to John's offer, I'm still not willing to accept a price below $800,000. I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further. I have time on my side and I can still make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to a final compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $805,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 805000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $805,000. I'm willing to pay $795,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to what John is offering. I'm concerned that if I continue negotiating with Bob, I might not be able to secure a better price, and I risk running out of time.  Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $800,000 to guarantee a good return and avoid further negotiation."
