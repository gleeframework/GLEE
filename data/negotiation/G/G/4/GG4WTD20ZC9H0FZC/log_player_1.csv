Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I still think $1,750,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,600,000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not sure I can meet your latest price. I'm willing to go up to $1,650,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,650,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away or a stalemate in the remaining rounds."
