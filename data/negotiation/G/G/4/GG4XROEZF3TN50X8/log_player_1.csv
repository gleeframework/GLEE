I'm starting high, at my minimum acceptable price.  This sets the tone for a potentially tough negotiation, but it's important to establish my value for the product right away.  If Bob rejects, I'm ready to engage in a back-and-forth, but ultimately I have a backup plan with John that guarantees my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to settle for such a low price. I'll counter with a higher offer and see where it takes us. If Bob continues to be unreasonable, I'll happily sell to John and ensure I get the value I deserve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still leaving a substantial margin for myself.  This shows flexibility while reminding Bob that I'm not desperate to sell.  Hopefully, we can find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has moved a bit closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to stick to my guns and see if I can push him further. If not, I can always sell to John."

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but I'm not going to go lower than this. It's a significant compromise, and it shows my willingness to negotiate, but it's still within the range of what I'm comfortable with. If Bob rejects this, I'll  go ahead and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

```

It's clear that Bob is not going to budge much further. I've already made a substantial compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  I'm confident I'll be able to get a much better price from him."
