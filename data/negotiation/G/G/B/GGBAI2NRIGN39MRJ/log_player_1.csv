Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $900,000 and unwilling to budge.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. Accepting his offer would mean a $300,000 loss compared to John's offer.  At this point, it's more profitable to cut negotiations short and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
