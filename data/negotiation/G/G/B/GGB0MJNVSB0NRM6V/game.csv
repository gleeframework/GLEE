"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you than you'd find elsewhere, and it's closer to my desired price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget. However, $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10250",10250.0,Bob,4,
