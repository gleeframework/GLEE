Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible. I'll offer him:

{""product_price"": $900,000}

This is a relatively high offer, but I'm willing to compromise to get a good deal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a good offer. Since the product is worth $800,000 to me, I'm not desperate to sell it, but I'm also not willing to wait indefinitely for a better offer.

I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $850,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll try to get closer to my target price of $900,000.

{""product_price"": $870,000}

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"
