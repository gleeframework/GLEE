"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal than $900,000.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that's still above Alice's value for the product, but significantly lower than the initial offer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a fair price, but also highlights the potential for savings. This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to accept a deal that's still profitable for her, while also saving Bob money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $870,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than his original budget of $1,000,000 and even lower than his previous counteroffer.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further offers or that he might end up paying more if he decides to buy from John. Accepting Alice's offer secures a good price and avoids further negotiation risks."
