{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to make a profit. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1450000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1350000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still below what I want. There's room for more negotiation. I'm going to counter his offer to see if we can meet in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
