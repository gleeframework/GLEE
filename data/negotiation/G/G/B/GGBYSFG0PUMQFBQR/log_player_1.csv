"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is reflective of the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired selling point. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Justifying the Price:** Highlighting the product's ""immense value and potential"" and emphasizing the ""significant return on investment"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a high level.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial high price gives you room to potentially lower the price in subsequent rounds while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

This strategy sets the stage for a negotiation where you can potentially maximize your profit while staying aware of Bob's reactions and the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still substantially lower than your initial asking price and a good margin above your minimum. There's room for negotiation to potentially bridge the gap and get closer to your desired selling price. You'll use the next round to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. It demonstrates a serious commitment to acquiring the product.  While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product, in terms of potential and long-term returns, is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  I believe this revised price point represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:**  It's important to show Bob you respect his position in the negotiation, even if you're not accepting his offer outright.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Gently reminding Bob of the product's high value helps to justify a price point above his initial offer.
* **Strategic Concession:** Lowering the price by $200,000 shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price well above your minimum.
* **Framing as a Compromise:**  Positioning this counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to see it as a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's willingness to negotiate, but I still think $2,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet in the middle and pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground, signaling his genuine interest in the product. At $1,900,000, the offer is:

* **Significantly Above Your Minimum:** You're securing a $400,000 profit above your absolute bottom line.
* **Strong Return:**  This represents a healthy profit margin on the product. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling negotiations, potentially making you lose out on both offers.

Accepting now secures a strong deal and avoids potential complications from extended negotiations."
