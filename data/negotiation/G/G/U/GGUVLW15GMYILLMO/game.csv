"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price for both of us and will allow you to benefit greatly from this product.  Let's try to make this deal work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
