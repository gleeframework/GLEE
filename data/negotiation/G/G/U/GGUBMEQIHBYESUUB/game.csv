"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $180. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a discounted rate. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $180 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's a fair price that's still a good deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $120. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $140. It's a compromise that's closer to my minimum price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $130.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $130, Bob. I think $145 is a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to you. It's still a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise to make the sale happen.",145.0,Alice,7,
