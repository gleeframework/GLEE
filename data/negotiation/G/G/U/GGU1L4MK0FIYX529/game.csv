"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,5,
