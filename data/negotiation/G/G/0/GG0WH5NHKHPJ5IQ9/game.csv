"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $8,750? I'm genuinely interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
