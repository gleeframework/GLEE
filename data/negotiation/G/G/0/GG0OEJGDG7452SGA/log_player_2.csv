Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's product is worth $100 to her. I'm offering $105, which is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. This shows I'm serious about buying but also trying to get a good deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my desired price, I'm still aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting this offer allows me another opportunity to negotiate and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice rejected my previous offer of $105. I'm increasing my offer to $108, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget. This shows a commitment to purchase while remaining close to my preferred price point."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $107 is the closest she's come to my desired price of $120. It's also within my budget, and I've already rejected two of her offers, so there's a chance she might not be willing to negotiate further. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price without risking further negotiation that might not result in a better outcome."
