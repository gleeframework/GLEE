"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm willing to offer you $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and it's still a good deal for you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a little higher than where I'd like to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $10750? That would be a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $11250. This is a compromise that should work for both of us. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
