"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  You have room to bargain since you're willing to pay $15,000."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm willing to offer you $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and it's still a good deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you can still try to negotiate lower. You have room to maneuver since you're willing to pay up to $15,000.  Let's try to get closer to your $10,000 target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a little higher than where I'd like to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $11250. This is a compromise that should work for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is closer to your target of $10,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, it's possible she won't budge further. At this point, it's a good deal for you and avoids the risk of her walking away or you having to buy from John at a higher price."
