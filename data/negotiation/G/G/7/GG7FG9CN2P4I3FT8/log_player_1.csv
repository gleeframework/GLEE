"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  Since I know the product is worth at least $150 to me, I'm leaving room to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than Bob's initial offer of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still a decent profit for me, but it's also a step closer to my minimum acceptable price and might be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale by continuing to negotiate."
