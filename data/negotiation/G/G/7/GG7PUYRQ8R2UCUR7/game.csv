"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm happy to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're close to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package worth $20,000, which is a $10,000 value. This way, you'll get the product for $1,030,000. What do you think?",1030000.0,Alice,5,
