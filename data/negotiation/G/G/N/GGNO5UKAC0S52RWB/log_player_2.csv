"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, it's reasonable to assume she's not willing to sell it for less than that.  Rejecting the offer allows us to start the negotiation process and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,100,000, which is $100,000 lower than her original price and $100,000 higher than my offer.  It's a good deal for me, considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to me. Accepting her offer means saving $100,000 compared to buying from John."
