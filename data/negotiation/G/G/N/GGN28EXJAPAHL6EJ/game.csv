"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $7,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob. However, $7,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $7,800? That's my final offer.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a deal, Bob. However, $7,800 is still not enough for me to sell the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",11000.0,Alice,7,
