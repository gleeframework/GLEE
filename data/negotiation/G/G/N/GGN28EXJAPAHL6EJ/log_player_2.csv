"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $7,500? That's a fair compromise, I think."", ""product_price"": 7500}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob. However, $7,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to make a deal, Bob. However, $7,800 is still not enough for me to sell the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $9,000 and is now moving further away from your price point.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000."
