"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 seems a little steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally good to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the asking price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Within Budget:** $80 is well within my budget and gives a good starting point to potentially get the product for a steal. 
* **Polite & Open:** The message aims to be polite and not offend Alice while expressing interest and initiating the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your bottom line. You could try to negotiate further, but there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and you'd risk losing the deal. Accepting the $100 offer ensures you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
