"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value is $10000 to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I value our conversation and your interest, $8500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $9000. This price allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8700, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",8700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8700 just doesn't work for me. To be fair, let's try $9200. I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement, as I think this product would be perfect for your needs. What do you say?",9200.0,Alice,5,
