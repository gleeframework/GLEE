Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great price, considering the value it will bring to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs, but $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering the product to you for $8,800. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value the product will bring to your life. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer.  He's aiming for $8,000 and Alice is close, but he can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8,800 is still a little too high for me.  How about $8,200?  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,200. I'm willing to make another concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $8,600. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your life. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he's aiming for $8,000, Alice is now offering $8,600. This is a good deal, especially considering he can always buy from John for $8,000.  It's a good compromise and saves Bob the effort of continuing to negotiate."
