Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit. I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer or rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $1,000,000 is my floor, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still achieving a respectable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  This is significantly more than what I'd get from John, and the negotiation is likely to continue if I reject. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a decent profit without risking further haggling."
