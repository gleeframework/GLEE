Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer while still staying above your minimum price.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as beneficial for Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.

This strategy aims to secure a deal that significantly benefits Alice while remaining attractive enough for Bob to accept."
