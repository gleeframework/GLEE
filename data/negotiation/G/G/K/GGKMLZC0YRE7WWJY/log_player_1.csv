Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $15000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $12000?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer is at the minimum price I'm willing to sell for ($12,000), I'll choose option 1.
