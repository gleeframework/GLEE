Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value of $100, leaving room for negotiation. This also allows me to potentially get closer to the product's value to Bob, maximizing my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?"", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $107.50 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $105 is still slightly below my preferred price, it's very close. Given the possibility of more rounds of negotiation potentially leading to a further lowering of the price, and the fact that John is willing to buy for $100, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale at a price that is just above my minimum."
