"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob. Alice's offer of $15,000 is too high.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Bob is trying to get the best price, so he's offering significantly less than Alice's price.  He's aiming for a price that's still within his budget but also significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob still wants to get the best possible price, and $12,000 is still higher than his target of $10,000.  He's willing to keep negotiating, but is also aware he can always buy the product from John."

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but still wants to try to get a better deal. $9,500 is a compromise, showing Alice he's serious about buying but also pushing for a price closer to his target."
