Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,100,000.  I know it's valuable to you and this is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting with a higher offer ($1,100,000) leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still come down slightly while remaining above our minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at our desired price."
