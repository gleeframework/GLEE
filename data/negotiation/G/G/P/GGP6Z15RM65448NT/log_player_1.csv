Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message explicitly states I'm open to negotiation, signaling to Bob that he might be able to get a better deal. 
* **Considering John:** While I'm aiming for the best possible price, I'm aware of John's offer of $150 as a safety net. I'll be willing to accept offers above that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $60 is far below my minimum acceptable value of $150, and even significantly lower than the value to Bob ($80).
* **Negotiation is necessary:** I believe there's room for a more reasonable price. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a more acceptable price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $110. This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, aiming for a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $110 is a fair price.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  $110 is still significantly higher than John's offer, so I'm not risking losing too much money if Bob rejects this offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $110 is closer, I'm still aiming for something under $80. How about $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While he's moved closer to my minimum acceptable value, $70 is still below the product's worth to him and significantly less than my minimum price of $150. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continued negotiation with Bob might result in a price even lower than $70, making it a poor deal for me.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value of $150. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit with John than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a much lower price."
