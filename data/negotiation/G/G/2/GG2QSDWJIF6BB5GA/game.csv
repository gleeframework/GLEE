"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $9,000 right now.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $11,000 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still too much for me.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and I'm confident I can get this product closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about staying within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $10,500 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really pushing my budget here, but I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're pushing your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm proposing a price of $10,250 for the product. It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
