"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,400,000 is still too high, and there's room for negotiation.  He can counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I believe this product holds, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still above his ideal price, $1,350,000 is a good compromise.  It's lower than John's price, and Bob can likely find ways to recoup some of the cost through his own work with the product."
