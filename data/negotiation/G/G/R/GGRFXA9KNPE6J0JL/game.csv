"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $16500?",16500.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm still very interested in the product, but $16500 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15750? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",15750.0,Bob,4,,
