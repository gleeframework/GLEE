"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about $850,000?  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  While I understand your perspective, $750,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $800,000. This is fair for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.",800000.0,Alice,5,
