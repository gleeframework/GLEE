"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate down while still getting a good price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make the offer seem more attractive.

This strategy allows for a good starting point while keeping the option to sell to John as a backup if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).  There's still potential to negotiate a higher price, especially since he expressed interest in the product. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to negotiate. This can encourage him to increase his offer in the next round.
* **Maintaining Options:**  Rejecting the offer keeps my option to sell to John open, ensuring I'll at least get my minimum price if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it offers. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Positive and Solution-Oriented Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and emphasizing finding a solution that benefits both parties. 
* **Value Reminder:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while maintaining a good negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,000 again? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I can afford it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:**  Bob's message indicates that $13,000 is likely his absolute maximum. He's reiterated his interest in the product, making it unlikely he'll go higher. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're already on round 4, and each round reduces our chances of securing a better price.  
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While selling to John for $15,000 is the most profitable option, there's a risk that the negotiation with Bob could break down completely. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit. 

This decision balances the desire for a higher price with the need to secure a sale before the negotiation window closes."
