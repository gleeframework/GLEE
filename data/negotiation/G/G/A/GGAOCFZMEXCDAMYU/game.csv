"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being open to negotiations.  $9,000 is a bit lower than I can realistically go right now, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the reduction, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,000. Can you consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $10,000 just isn't enough for me to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer $10,500. This is my final offer. If you're not able to go that high, I'll unfortunately have to look at other options. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but no higher. I'm starting to consider buying from John for $8,000 if we can't meet on a price. Can you think about meeting me at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
