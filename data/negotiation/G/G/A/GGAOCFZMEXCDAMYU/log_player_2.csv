Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being open to negotiations.  $9,000 is a bit lower than I can realistically go right now, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?
