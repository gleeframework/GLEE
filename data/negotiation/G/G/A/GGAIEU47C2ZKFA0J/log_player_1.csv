"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  I'm offering it to you at $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I can't go as low as $18,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $20,000?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $19,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $19,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $19,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for more, accepting $19,500 is a strong profit above my minimum.  It's always possible negotiations could stall, and it's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or needing to go with John at the last minute."
