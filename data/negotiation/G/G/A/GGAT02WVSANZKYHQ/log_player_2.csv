"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. There are still 9 rounds left, giving Bob ample opportunity to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  I'm happy to discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting strong by making a bold counteroffer close to his maximum budget. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about saving money and is willing to walk away if necessary.  By leaving room for negotiation in his message, Bob is opening the door for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to reduce the price to 1200000, considering the value this product can bring to you. Let's discuss further and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a better offer than the previous round, it's still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob has 7 rounds remaining. He wants to try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than where I can comfortably be right now.  I'm happy to go to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute limit."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting as close to $1,000,000 as possible. He's showing Alice he's serious about this price point, but also demonstrating flexibility by offering a slightly higher amount. The message emphasizes his absolute limit, putting pressure on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to reduce the price to 1150000, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still very close to his maximum budget and there are 5 rounds left to negotiate.  The offer from Alice is tempting, but he can likely push for a lower price. He has shown he is willing to walk away, which puts pressure on Alice.  By rejecting the offer, Bob shows Alice that he is serious about his negotiation strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  I'm still close to my limit, but I can go to $1,125,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to push for a lower price, but he's also demonstrating a willingness to compromise. He's moving closer to Alice's offer while staying within his budget. By suggesting a middle ground price, Bob is showing Alice that he's open to finding a solution that benefits both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below 1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at 1120000. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice is now willing to sell the product for $1,120,000, Bob still hasn't reached his goal of paying under $1,000,000. With only three rounds remaining, the risk of not being able to negotiate a lower price is too high.  Since John offers the product for $1,000,000, it's the most financially sound decision to buy from John now and avoid any potential further negotiation with Alice."
