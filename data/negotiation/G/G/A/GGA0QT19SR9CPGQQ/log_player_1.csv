# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
