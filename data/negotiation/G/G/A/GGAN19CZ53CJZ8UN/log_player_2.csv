"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  Bob's goal is to get the product for under $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is a strong starting point for the negotiation.  He's indicating a willingness to negotiate but also setting a clear limit on what he's willing to pay.  The $10,000 price is halfway between Alice's price and Bob's maximum budget, which might be seen as a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's budget.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. He still has several rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  However, he is still keeping the price below his budget.  This shows Alice that he is serious about purchasing the product but won't overpay.  The $12,000 price is a reasonable compromise, meeting halfway between his previous offer and Alice's most recent offer."
