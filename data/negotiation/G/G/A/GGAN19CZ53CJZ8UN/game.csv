"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
