"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $88.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $88 is still below my minimum, it's getting closer.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid potentially wasting more time with counteroffers and risking John's offer."
