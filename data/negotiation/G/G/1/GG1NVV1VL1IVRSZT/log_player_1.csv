Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target price:** I want to get as close to my minimum of $1,500,000 as possible.
* **Bob's value:** I know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  So, $1,200,000 is a significant premium for him, but still potentially attractive.
* **Negotiation space:** This gives us room to negotiate. I can potentially go lower if needed, but I'm starting high to maximize my profit.
* **John as a safety net:**  Having John's offer of $1,500,000 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob is hesitant, he has shown some willingness to negotiate. I can likely get a better price with a counteroffer.
* **John is the backup plan:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to be firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows you a good profit margin, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,200,000.
* **Value proposition:**  I emphasize the value Bob will still gain at $1,100,000.
* **Fairness:**  I frame it as a ""solution that works for both of us,"" emphasizing the idea of a win-win.
* **Room for negotiation:**  This price still allows room for further negotiation if needed, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this price is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for me. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result:** Bob is not willing to come up to a price that is acceptable to me.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a much better outcome. It's the most financially sound decision.

By selling to John, I ensure a significantly higher profit than what I would get from Bob, even after several rounds of negotiation."
