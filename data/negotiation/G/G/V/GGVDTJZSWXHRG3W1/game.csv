"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $7,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
