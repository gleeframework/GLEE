"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is still a fair price for both of us, as it's well above your own valuation.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this point.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,025,000, which is $1,050,000. I'm not willing to go any lower than this, so I hope you can see the value in this offer.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,040,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us.",1040000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the bottom line, and I'm not sure I'm willing to budge further. I'm willing to make one last offer to you: $1,045,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1045000.0,Alice,9,
