{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message:** It's friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Get a good starting point:** By offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, I create a gap for negotiation.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** The message demonstrates flexibility and openness to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain my fallback option:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $600,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far too low. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even lower than the price I offered him initially.  

**Why Rejecting is the Best Choice:**

* **Value Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a massive loss for me.
* **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 at any time, giving me leverage in negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is more realistic and still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is significantly lower than its true value, I understand you have a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still allows for a good deal for you, while also reflecting the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:**  $900,000 is a significant compromise from my initial offer of $1,200,000 but still well above Bob's offer.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's budget while also highlighting the product's value. This helps to keep the negotiation amicable and focused on finding a solution. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gaining Ground:** This counteroffer helps to narrow the price gap and show that I am serious about negotiating a deal.
* **Protecting Value:** $900,000 is still a substantial price for Bob, ensuring that I don't sacrifice too much.
* **Setting the Stage:** By offering a compromise, I aim to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer. If he continues to offer a price far below my minimum acceptable, I will consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is closer to my initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a substantial financial loss.

**Why Rejecting is the Best Choice:**

* **Value Loss:** Selling for $750,000 would be a significant loss compared to my fallback option of $1,500,000 with John.
* **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting allows me to counteroffer again and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 at any time, giving me leverage in negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our prices. I'll try to be persuasive and highlight the value of the product. However, if Bob continues to offer a price far below my minimum acceptable, I will consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $750,000 is still not a price I can accept.  I understand your budget constraints, but this product is truly exceptional and holds significant value.  Let's aim for a middle ground: $850,000. This price reflects the product's value while still being a reasonable compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:**  $850,000 is a compromise that meets Bob halfway from his last offer of $750,000.  It is still significantly higher than his initial offer, but lower than my previous offer of $900,000.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value. It acknowledges Bob's budget constraints but highlights the potential for a fair deal for both parties.

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my financial interests.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** $850,000 is still above Bob's initial offer, giving me some leverage in the negotiations.
* **Final Push:**  This counteroffer is an attempt to find a mutually acceptable price before considering the alternative of selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

I will wait for Bob's response and decide my next move based on his counteroffer. If he continues to offer a price far below my minimum acceptable, I will seriously consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
