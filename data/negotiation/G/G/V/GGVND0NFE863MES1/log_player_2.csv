Alice's offer:

This price still allows for a good deal for you, while also reflecting the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $750,000 is still not a price I can accept.  I understand your budget constraints, but this product is truly exceptional and holds significant value.  Let's aim for a middle ground: $850,000. This price reflects the product's value while still being a reasonable compromise.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000, and it's not worth the risk of her cutting off negotiations. Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees you get the product within your budget."
