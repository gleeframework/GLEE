Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product today.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussion."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations above your target price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Confidence:** A strong opening offer conveys the product's value to you.
* **Alternative:** Knowing John is a guaranteed $15,000 sale provides leverage. You don't need to settle for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum perceived value, but significantly below your minimum. There's room for negotiation, and you have a strong alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I can consider.  How about we meet in the middle? Would $17,000 be acceptable?"", ""product_price"": 17000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate but stays well above your $15,000 guarantee from John.
* **Justification:** By saying ""meet in the middle,"" you're framing it as a compromise, even though you moved down more than Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This will help determine how flexible Bob is willing to be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still believe that $12,000 is a fair price for the product. I hope you can understand my position and agree to this amount.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is unwilling to budge from his initial offer, which is significantly below your minimum.  
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired minimum price. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob has uncertain outcomes and could take more time, while John represents an immediate and favorable sale."
