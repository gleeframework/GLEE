"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $14,500. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  This product looks good, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go. This product offers you significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to stick to my budget. Could we agree on $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. Let's split the difference - how about $11,625? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",11625.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me.  I'd be willing to do $11,200 to get this done today.  What do you say?",11200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up.  To be honest, I have another offer I need to consider, but I'd rather make this deal with you. If you could do $11,500, I think we can wrap this up right now.",11500.0,Alice,7,
