"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $900,000 is a good offer, I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $900,000 is below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your initial offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still thinking $950,000 is a fair price for the product. It's a significant discount from your initial offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating willingness to negotiate. Holding out a bit longer could lead to a better outcome than $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen. How about $1,000,000? This is a strong offer considering its value and our negotiations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $950,000. How about we meet at $980,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

Bob is clearly committed to acquiring the product and is steadily increasing his offers. Accepting $980,000 at this stage secures a significant profit while avoiding the risk of pushing him away in further rounds."
