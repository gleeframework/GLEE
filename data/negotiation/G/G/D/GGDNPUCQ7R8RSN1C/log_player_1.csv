{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is still attractive to Bob, giving him $1,000 in potential savings, while also giving you a good starting point for potential profit.  I'm also using a friendly tone in my message to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation."
