(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are incrementally increasing and significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's beneficial for me. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation."
