"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you and the effort I've put into developing it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1050000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1050000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1080000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for you and the effort I've put into developing it.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
