"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $725000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with a price of $825000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,,
