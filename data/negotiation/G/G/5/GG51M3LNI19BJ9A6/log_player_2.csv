# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. It's worth $120 to you, and she's asking for $150. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $110 right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still a bit too high. While $130 is better than $150, it's still more than the product is worth to you. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $130 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but $120 is my absolute limit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I need to make a small profit. I'll offer you the product for $125. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $125 is still a bit higher than what the product is worth to me. Since I have the option to buy from John for $120, it makes more sense to go with John's offer and save $5."
