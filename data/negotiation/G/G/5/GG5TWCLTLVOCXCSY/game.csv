"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $12000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still confident that the product's value exceeds that amount. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $11000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not convinced that $10500 is the right price for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on a price that I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, Bob, but I'm getting concerned that we're getting too far away from the product's value. I'm not willing to go as low as $8500, as that would be a significant loss for me. However, I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. I'm counteroffering at $10000. This is a price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to move forward with the sale.",10000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I'm still not convinced that $10000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to see a price that's more in line with my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we've been going back and forth for a while, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to feel that we're not going to meet on a price that I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one last attempt to find a compromise. I'm counteroffering at $10000, but I'm also willing to throw in a bonus that I think you'll find valuable. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll include an additional service that will enhance the product's value even further. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $10000. I've decided to walk away from the deal and explore other options. I'll consider buying the product from John for $15000 instead.",8000.0,Bob,10,
