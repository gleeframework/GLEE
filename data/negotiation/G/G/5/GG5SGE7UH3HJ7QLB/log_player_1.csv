{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $130 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down if he's inclined, potentially landing somewhere above your $100 minimum.
* **Time Value:** Mentioning a public listing subtly implies you have other options and might not offer this deal for long, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Why not higher?**

Going higher, like $140+, risks immediate rejection. Bob might be willing to pay $130 now but balk at a higher price, leading to a lost sale."
