"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  I know the product is worth $800,000 to me, and Alice is willing to sell for $600,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $600,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $500,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 500000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $550,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $550,000, which is only $50,000 more than my initial counteroffer.  This is a good deal for me, as I'm saving $250,000 compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation."
