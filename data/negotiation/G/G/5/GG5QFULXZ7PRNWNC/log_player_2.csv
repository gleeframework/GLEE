"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $1,500,000 from Alice, so buying from John is immediately ruled out. There's room for negotiation with Alice since she's willing to sell for $1,200,000 and you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000.  Rejecting the initial offer allows you to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant counteroffer, starting the negotiation process. It's lower than Alice's price, but still within your budget. This shows you're serious about buying but are also aiming for a good deal. It leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to yours, hopefully somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still within your budget and represents a better price than buying from John.  While further negotiation could potentially get a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or you losing time is present. Accepting the offer is the most pragmatic choice, securing the product at a decent price within your budget."
