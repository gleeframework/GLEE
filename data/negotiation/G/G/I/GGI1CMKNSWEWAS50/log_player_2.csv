It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first. The price is too high for your budget, and there's still room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will put pressure on her to negotiate and hopefully move closer to my target price."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is coming down, but it's still higher than my target. I want to see if I can get her closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing that I'm serious about negotiating but still leaving room for compromise.  This should encourage Alice to meet me halfway."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While this offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than what I'd like to pay.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going all-in with my final counteroffer. This is my absolute maximum. I'm hoping Alice recognizes that we are very close and decides to close the deal. If she rejects, I'll move on to John as a backup."
