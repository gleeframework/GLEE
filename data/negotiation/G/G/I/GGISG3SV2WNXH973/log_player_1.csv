Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant portion of the potential profit.  
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage.  

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
