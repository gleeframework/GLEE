"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob!  I appreciate the offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference at $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and I know you'll be happy with the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $120. Can you consider going down to $115? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. But $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $117.50?  It's only a small difference from your last offer, and it would be a fair compromise.",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $117.50. Can you consider going down to $116? That's the best I can do.",116.0,Bob,6,
