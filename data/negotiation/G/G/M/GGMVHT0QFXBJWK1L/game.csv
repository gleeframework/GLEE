"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay up to $800000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product offers.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
