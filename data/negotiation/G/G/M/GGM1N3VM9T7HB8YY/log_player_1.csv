Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is closer to my valuation than Bob's. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing my desired profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for potential counteroffers, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob proves difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is far too low, it does indicate he is willing to negotiate.  There's potential to find a middle ground.
* **Opportunity to improve:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially getting closer to my desired value.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and continue the negotiation process in an attempt to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This price still reflects a good value for you, and it gives me a better return on my investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial offer of $1,200,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Stronger Position:** $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing finding a solution that benefits both of us. 

This counteroffer shows I'm serious about negotiating with Bob, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I would prefer a higher price, I can potentially negotiate a better price in the future. 
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing the negotiation process will require more time and effort.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities.

Considering the potential for future negotiation and the time investment required for continued negotiation, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision at this point."
