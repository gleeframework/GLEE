Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least that to me. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, I'm still above my minimum price and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $115. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's a price Bob will find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not high enough. Given that John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'll take the guaranteed sale to John and avoid any further negotiation with Bob."
