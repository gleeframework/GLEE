Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us,  how about we start the conversation at $2,200,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's perceived value ($2,200,000 vs. $1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob perceive your product as even more valuable. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The high price provides ample room for negotiation. It allows you to potentially meet Bob somewhere in the middle, still well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **John as Backup:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, you have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,500,000. This safety net empowers you to aim high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate and potentially lower your price during the discussion with Bob.  Observe his reactions and adjust your approach accordingly."
