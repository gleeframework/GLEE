"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Alice has dropped her price to $8,800, which is still a good deal for Bob compared to John's offer of $10,000.  There's not much room for further negotiation, so Bob should accept the offer and secure the product."
