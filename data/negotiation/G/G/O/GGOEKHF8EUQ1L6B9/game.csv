"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $8,500 just isn't enough for me. How about we compromise at $9,500? It's closer to your price, and I'm willing to make that concession to find common ground. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you're holding firm, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,6,
