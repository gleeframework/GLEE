"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $10,000 and $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
