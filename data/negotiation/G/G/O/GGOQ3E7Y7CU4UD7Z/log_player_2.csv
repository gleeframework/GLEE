"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a price of $12,000. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so it's not worth paying $12,000.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $10,000 and $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to save money. While $11,000 is closer to his target, he can still try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000, which is $10,750. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and while Alice has come down in price, $10,750 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $10,000, it's the most logical choice at this point."
