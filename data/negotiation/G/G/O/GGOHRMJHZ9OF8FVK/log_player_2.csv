"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value, I can't accept $1,200,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  I'll try to negotiate further to see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  How about we compromise at $1,400,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
