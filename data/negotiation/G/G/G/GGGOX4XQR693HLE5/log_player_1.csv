"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This price also gives Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it yet. I want to see if Bob will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm lowering the price slightly, but still maintaining a significant profit. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get more if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm lowering the price again, but only by a small amount.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible, but also that I'm not desperate to sell. I'm hoping that this will be the price that convinces Bob to accept."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob is offering a price that's significantly above my minimum, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I think it's in my best interest to accept his offer and secure the sale."
