"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's priced fairly given its potential value. Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. It's the highest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too far below the product's true worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a significant stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1000000. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but $1000000 is unfortunately still far below the product's true value. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to lower my price one last time to $1300000.  This is the absolute lowest I can go while still ensuring a reasonable return on my investment. This is my final offer, and I urge you to consider it carefully.  If you are unable to meet this price, I'll have to pursue other options.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
