"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. While $8,500 is better than his initial $8,000, it's still below what I want. I have 8 rounds left to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my goal of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  How about we split the difference again and go with $9,125? I think that's a fair compromise that would make us both happy."", ""product_price"": 9125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but $9,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8,750. I think that's the best compromise we can reach. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I'd love to get closer to my target price, we're down to our last 4 rounds.  Bob's offers have been consistently below my minimum, and I'm running out of time to get a better deal."
