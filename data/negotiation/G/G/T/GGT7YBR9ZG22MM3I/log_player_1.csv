Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $14,000. I believe it could be of great value to you.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, there's no harm in starting with a higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** The offer is close to your minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This ensures that even if Bob negotiates down slightly, you'll still make a significant profit. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  By offering a ""special price,"" Alice subtly implies that this offer might not last, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** Alice needs to be prepared for Bob to reject this offer. If he does, she has the safety net of John who's willing to pay her minimum acceptable price."
