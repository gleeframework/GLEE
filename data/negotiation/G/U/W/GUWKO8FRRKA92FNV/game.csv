"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $11,250. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,250 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $12,000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I hope you'll consider it.  Let's close this deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
