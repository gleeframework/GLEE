"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start a counter-negotiation and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price given the value we both see in it, and it gives us both room to profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1100000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can push her lower. I'll reject this offer and try to counter-negotiate again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise that leaves both of us with a profitable deal. Let's see if we can close this out."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $1080000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While I'd still prefer a lower price,  $1,080,000 is within my budget and a good deal considering the value of the product.  Accepting the offer saves me time and ensures I secure the product without having to risk buying from John at a higher price."
