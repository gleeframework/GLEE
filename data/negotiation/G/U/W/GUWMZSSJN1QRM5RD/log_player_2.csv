"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can get the product for a lower price than from John, so it's worth exploring that option."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice $85. This is a fair price that's still below my maximum of $100, but also gives Alice a decent profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $90, which is still a good price for me.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking another counteroffer and potentially ending up paying more or having to buy from John."
