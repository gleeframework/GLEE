"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. I believe you'll find its value far exceeds this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer. To provide some context, the product has a significant value to us and we believe it deserves a higher price. We are willing to negotiate further, so let me propose an alternative: $11,000. This still allows us to cover our costs while providing a fair margin for our business. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're considering.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, you can still try to get a better price.  Rejecting this offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price point of $10,500."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,500. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to make the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to reconsider our negotiation terms. In light of this, I propose a final offer of $10,800 for the product. This allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,800, which is only $300 more than your last counteroffer of $10,500.  This is a good deal for you considering your maximum budget is $15,000.  Accepting this offer will save you $4,200 compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise and a successful negotiation."
