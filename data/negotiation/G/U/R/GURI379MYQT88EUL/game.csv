"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer. To provide some context, the product has a significant value to us and we believe it deserves a higher price. We are willing to negotiate further, so let me propose an alternative: $11,000. This still allows us to cover our costs while providing a fair margin for our business. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're considering.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,500. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to make the purchase.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to reconsider our negotiation terms. In light of this, I propose a final offer of $10,800 for the product. This allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",10800.0,Alice,5,
