"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. It's worth $100 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. It's a steal at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice is overselling the product's value to you. While $90 is less than John's $100 price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or seeing if she offers a lower price later."
