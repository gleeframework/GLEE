"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. This is my best offer, so I hope we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer.  However, $110 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $117.50.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make this work, but $117.50 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $115. I hope we can find a compromise here.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway.  $115 is a good start, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $116.25? It's a small step up, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering our back-and-forth.  Let's aim for a quick resolution!",116.25,Alice,7,
