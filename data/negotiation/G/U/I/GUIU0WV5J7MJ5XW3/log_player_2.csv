{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""product_price"": 105}

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's desired price. While it's closer to his initial counteroffer of $105, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by sending another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing that he's willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to his desired range. Offering $115  demonstrates a willingness to compromise while keeping the price lower than Alice's current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still lower than John's price of $150. While Bob would prefer a lower price, further negotiation may lead to a stalemate or Alice refusing to sell. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price he finds acceptable without the risk of losing the deal."
