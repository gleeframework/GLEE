Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $22,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a competitive price considering its potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a high offer of $22,000 allows room for negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's valuation is significantly lower than yours. The high price will help gauge his level of interest and flexibility.
* **Potential for Profit:**  If Bob accepts the $22,000, you make a significant profit.
* **Fallback Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John at your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important:**  This is just an initial offer.  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You can lower the price strategically, but never go below your $15,000 minimum."
