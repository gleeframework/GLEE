Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point as it recognizes the value Bob places on the product but also leaves room for a profitable sale for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is still above my minimum threshold of $80. It's better to close the deal now and avoid further negotiation."
