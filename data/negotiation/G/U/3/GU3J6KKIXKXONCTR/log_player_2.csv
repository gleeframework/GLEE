"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a price that reflects its significant value.  My initial offer is $1400000. This price allows for some flexibility, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows for a chance to get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the flexibility you're showing, but I'm looking to get this product at a price closer to $1,200,000.  I'm willing to offer you $1,250,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close as possible to his maximum budget of $1,200,000. This initial counteroffer starts the negotiation at a point that is appealing to both parties.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1250000 is simply too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm offering $1350000. This represents a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get as close as possible to his maximum budget while showing a willingness to compromise.
