"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $1,080,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and it allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,080,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,020,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product.",1020000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find common ground. I'm willing to meet you one last time, but I need $1,050,000 to make this deal work for me. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider selling to John. Let me know your final decision.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $990,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",990000.0,Bob,6,
