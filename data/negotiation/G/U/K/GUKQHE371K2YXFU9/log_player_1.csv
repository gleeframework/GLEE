``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price that is a good compromise between my minimum value ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). It also leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm looking to save some money, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll counteroffer to try to reach a more acceptable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I won't sell the product for less than $11,000. I'll counteroffer with a slight concession."
