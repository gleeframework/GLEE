"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $12,000 is still above your budget of $8,000. You should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $10,500 is still above your budget of $8,000. You should try to negotiate a better price.  You have more rounds left, so you can try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product.  This would be a win-win scenario for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still a good price for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 10500 is still a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 11000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product holds for you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $11,000, which is closer to your budget but still above your preferred price.  You only have 5 rounds left.  If you keep negotiating, you risk Alice getting frustrated and not budging further. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000, as you are likely to save more time and effort this way."
