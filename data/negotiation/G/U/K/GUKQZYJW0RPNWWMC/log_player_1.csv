{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum threshold of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that I understand the value of the product to Bob and am willing to be flexible.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, given the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I want for the product. I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob."
