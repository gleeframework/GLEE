Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still a significant amount. Since I don't know if I can get a better offer from Bob, I'll choose to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a higher price.
