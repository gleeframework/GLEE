Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $740,000. This is my final concession, so I hope we can seal the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $740,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is now relatively small and we risk her walking away from the deal entirely.  It's better to secure the product at $740,000, a significant savings compared to John's offer."
