# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a significant amount to you.  My asking price is $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a healthy margin for you.  Let's discuss further.

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still allows for a healthy profit margin for you, and it reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?
