"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $135
* **Your value:** $150
* **Alice's value:** $120

Since Alice's offer is lower than your value for the product ($135 < $150), it makes sense to accept. You save $15 compared to buying from John."
