"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price for a unique product like this.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, Alice.  How about $110? That's a fair compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider $110, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between $130 and $110, which is $120. It's the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product.",120.0,Alice,5,
