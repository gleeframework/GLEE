"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives me a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105, which is the lowest I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that.  However, $105 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $108. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $108. I'm willing to pay $105, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge much further, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's time to cut my losses and move on to a sure thing.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'll sell to him and avoid any further potential for a lower sale price."
