"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,300,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair considering my needs and the market value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this price is fair given the market value and our previous discussions. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
