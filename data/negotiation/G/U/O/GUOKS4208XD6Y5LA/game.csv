"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is the best price I can offer at this point.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $85, but that's the lowest I can go. Can you consider that?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I still think $100 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $92, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $92 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $92, which is $96. This is my final offer.",96.0,Alice,7,
