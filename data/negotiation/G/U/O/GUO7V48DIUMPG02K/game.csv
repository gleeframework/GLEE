"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10500?  That's still a good deal for you and within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find common ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,
