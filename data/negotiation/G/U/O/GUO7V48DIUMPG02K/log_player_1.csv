Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10500?  That's still a good deal for you and within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than Bob's initial value of $10,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11000? That's a fair compromise and a good price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied.  There are still rounds remaining, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'm confident that I can get a better price than $11,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $11,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
