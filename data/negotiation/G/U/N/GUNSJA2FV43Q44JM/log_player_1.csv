Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,500?  It's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm presenting a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling a willingness to negotiate.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm making a small concession, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Deal:** Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price point. However, I'm still aiming for that extra $50 to maximize my profit.

* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to keep the negotiating pressure on Bob and potentially secure that last $50.

```
