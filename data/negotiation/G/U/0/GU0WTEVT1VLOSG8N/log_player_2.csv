Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your continued efforts to reach an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $790000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $795000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I've placed on the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Alice's offer of $795,000 is very close to my target price and significantly lower than John's offer.
* **Only One Round Left:** This is the penultimate round. If I reject, I'll have one more chance to negotiate, but there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and I risk having to buy from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential savings from another round of negotiation are minimal compared to the risk of not securing a deal with Alice.  

It's a good deal at this price, and it's better to accept and secure the product."
