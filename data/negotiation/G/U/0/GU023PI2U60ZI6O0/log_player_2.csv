"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price.  You should definitely reject and counter-offer a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $8,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a good starting point in a negotiation. It establishes a floor for your side and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  By starting low, you signal that you're willing to negotiate but also that you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have the option to buy from John for $12,000. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $8,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved significantly closer to your price range, but you can still try to negotiate a little further. You know you have John's offer of $12,000 to fall back on if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we settle at $10,000?  That's a fair offer that gets us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer splits the difference between your last offer ($8,000) and Alice's current offer ($12,500). It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant saving.
* **Staying Below Your Maximum:** Importantly, this offer keeps you well below your $12,000 maximum budget.
* **Pressure on Alice:** Alice is aware you have an alternative option (John's offer). By proposing a reasonable price, you put some pressure on her to accept, knowing that you could walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $12,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now met your maximum price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John, as they both offer the same price. Take the deal with Alice!"
