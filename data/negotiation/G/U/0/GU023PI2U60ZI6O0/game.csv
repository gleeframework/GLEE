"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $8,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we settle at $10,000?  That's a fair offer that gets us closer to a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $12,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,5,
