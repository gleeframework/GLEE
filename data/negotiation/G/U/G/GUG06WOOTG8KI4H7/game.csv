"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better than that. How about we try $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $1,300,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,275,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit while ensuring you get a good deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better than that. How about we try $1,225,000? I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm willing to make one more compromise.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're nearing your limit, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm open to finding a compromise, but I can't go below $1,250,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than my original offer. Would you consider this final offer?",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to hold firm on your price, but I'm really close to walking away. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $1,230,000? This is as low as I can go.",1230000.0,Bob,8,
