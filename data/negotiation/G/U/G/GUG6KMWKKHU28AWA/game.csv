"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $17000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $13000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15500?  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $15500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $14000? I think that's a fair price for this product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $14000 is still too far below my desired price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need at least $14500 to make this deal work. Let's find a common ground so we can both be happy with the outcome.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13500? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can agree on this price.",13500.0,Bob,6,
