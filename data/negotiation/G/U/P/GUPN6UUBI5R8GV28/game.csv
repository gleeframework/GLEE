"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the unique features and quality of your product. However, based on my research and needs, I am looking to spend no more than $80 for this product. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, due to the high demand and limited supply, I cannot lower the price too much. I would like to offer the product to you for $95, which still reflects its value while accommodating your budget.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I think $95 is still slightly above my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps $90 would be a fair compromise for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
