"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $9000 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping to get for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's also a good deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10000. I think that's a fair compromise considering the market value. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on the price, but I'm still looking for something a little closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair reflection of the value of the product. Let's close the deal and move forward.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10500. I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. Can you consider this offer?",10500.0,Bob,6,
