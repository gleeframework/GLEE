Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good idea to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Anchoring:** Offering $120 sets an ""anchor"" price in Bob's mind. Even though it's higher than his valuation, it might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay more than $80. 
 
It's important to remember that this is just the opening move. I'm prepared to negotiate and adjust my price based on Bob's response and counteroffers. I'll also keep in mind my ""walk away"" option of selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($80) and his own stated value ($80).  Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me. 

While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to undervalue the product. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, aiming to find a price point that's more reasonable for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've significantly lowered my price from the initial $120 to $90, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise between my desired price and Bob's initial offer. 
* **Profitable:** $90 is still a profitable price for me, exceeding my minimum of $80.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to engage in a more realistic negotiation.  I'm prepared to make further adjustments, but I'll also keep in mind the option to sell to John for my guaranteed $80 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $70 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While he's moved closer to my range, it's clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 

At this point, continuing the negotiation carries the risk of:

* **Further price reductions:** Bob might be unwilling to go much higher than $70.
* **Stalled negotiations:** We could get stuck in a back-and-forth that wastes time and leads nowhere.

Selling to John for $80 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the uncertainty and potential for lower offers from Bob."
