"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I can do $110, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit above my budget.  How about $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that! I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you $107.50. That's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $102.50, which is my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen!",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $107.50. I think it's a great price for this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go.",105.0,Alice,7,
