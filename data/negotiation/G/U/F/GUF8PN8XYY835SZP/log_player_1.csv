"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening move, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It also establishes a baseline and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm trying to find a price point that's attractive to Bob while still getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $920,000. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, time is running out and this offer is still significantly higher than what John is offering.  It's a good deal considering the limited rounds remaining."
