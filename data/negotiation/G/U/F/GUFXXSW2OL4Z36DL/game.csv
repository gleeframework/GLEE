"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, $2,300,000 is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and potential for a significant return on your investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but  $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere? I'm willing to go up to $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal. However, we're still quite far apart in terms of price. I need to see a significant move to justify continuing this negotiation. To be transparent, I have other options for selling this product. So, I'm proposing $1,700,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product offers.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other options, and I appreciate the concessions you've made so far.  However, that price point is still a bit too rich for me.  To be completely transparent, I can get this product elsewhere for $1,000,000.  If you're able to come down to $1,100,000, I'm ready to close this deal today.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
