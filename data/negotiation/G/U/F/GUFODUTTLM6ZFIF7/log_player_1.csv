"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but it's not so high that he'll immediately reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $160 is better than my minimum, I think I can get a better price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I want to try to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm offering $180. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $170 is getting closer to what I want, I'm still confident I can get a better price. There are still 6 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it's still more than what Bob is currently offering. I hope this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to give it away for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I'm getting closer to my minimum. Accepting $165 is better than selling to John for $150 or continuing the negotiation and risking a lower price."
