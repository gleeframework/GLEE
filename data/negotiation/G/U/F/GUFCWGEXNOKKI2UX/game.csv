"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we meet at $1,300,000?  I believe this price reflects the product's true value while still offering you a good deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise. This leaves some room for both of us to come out ahead and ensures a smooth transaction.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
