"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,200,000 to him, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we meet at $1,300,000?  I believe this price reflects the product's true value while still offering you a good deal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should continue to negotiate to try to get a lower price."
