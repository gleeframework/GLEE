Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value of $12,000 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is truly interested. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Maximize Profit:**  $14,000 is a good starting point for maximizing profit, as it's $2,000 more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Understand John's Value:** Knowing John will pay $12,000 gives me a baseline.  Offering $14,000 to Bob is a good strategy as it leaves space for negotiation while ensuring I don't lose out.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  By offering $14,000, there's a chance Bob will reject the offer, but the potential reward of getting $2,000 more is worth the risk.

I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
