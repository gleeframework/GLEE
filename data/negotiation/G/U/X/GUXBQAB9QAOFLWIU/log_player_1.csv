"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is attempting to negotiate, it's unlikely he'll go above his perceived value of $10,000. John offers a guaranteed $10,000. It makes more financial sense to cut negotiations with Bob and sell to John."
