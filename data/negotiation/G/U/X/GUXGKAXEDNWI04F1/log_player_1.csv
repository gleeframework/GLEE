Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers.  I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You have a safety net with John ($15,000), so you don't need to accept anything below that.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a higher price ($20,000) leaves room for negotiation. While it's above Bob's perceived value, it might pique his interest. 
* **Creating a sense of exclusivity:**  By mentioning other buyers, you create a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he doesn't act quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves some risk. Bob might reject the offer outright, leaving you to sell to John at your minimum acceptable price. However, it provides the opportunity to potentially earn more."
