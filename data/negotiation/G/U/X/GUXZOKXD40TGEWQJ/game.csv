"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $100 for the product. I'm willing to pay a bit less since I think it's worth $80 to you, and I want to make sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $105. That leaves some room for profit for both of us, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your profit and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $102.50 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",102.5,Bob,4,
