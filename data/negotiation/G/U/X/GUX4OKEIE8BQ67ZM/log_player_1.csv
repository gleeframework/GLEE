Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of your product. However, I am looking to invest within a budget of $1000000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more and I have 9 rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but it still allows you to see a strong return on your investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I believe we can find a fair price that works for both of us. Considering the market value and potential returns, I would like to propose a price of $1100000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob has come up slightly, and while I'd prefer more, it's getting close to my minimum.  I've got a good chance of getting more with Jhon, but it's risky to wait. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and move on."
