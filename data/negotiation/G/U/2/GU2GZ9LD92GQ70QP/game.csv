"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm close to accepting your offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
