Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, she is unlikely to reach my target price of $800,000. She's already stated this is the lowest she can go. I can secure the product at my desired price from John without further negotiation."
