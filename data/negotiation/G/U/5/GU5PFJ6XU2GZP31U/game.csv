"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit away from that price point. Could you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
