Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I do value the product, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would still leave you with a good profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle on $11,250? This is still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.
