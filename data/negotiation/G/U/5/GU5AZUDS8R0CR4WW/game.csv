"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I do value the product, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would still leave you with a good profit margin.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle on $11,250? This is still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
