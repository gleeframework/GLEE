{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it gives me a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the benefit to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $1,300,000? That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the price John is offering. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it is still below my minimum desired price. John's offer is higher, and I'm not willing to lose out on that potential profit."
