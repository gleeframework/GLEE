Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still making a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Backup Offer:** Alice has the security of John's offer ($12,000) if Bob rejects her proposal.  

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome for Alice."
