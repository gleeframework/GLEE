"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1750000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  This price is still a good value for you and allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob or  potentially secure the deal with John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This price still gives you a solid return on your investment, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1550000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1350000, which is a fair compromise. I'm confident this deal will be profitable for both of us. Let's close this now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below my minimum.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a better deal overall. However, I want to see if I can still get a slightly better offer from Bob.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but if he rejects it, I'll close the deal with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This price is a good compromise for both of us. If you accept, we can finalize the deal and move forward.  If not, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1450000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1400000?  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is close, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I've already come down a significant amount, and I want to see if I can get closer to my goal. Plus, John's offer is still on the table, and I'm not completely opposed to going with him."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, but $1,400,000 is still just a little too low for me.  How about we meet at $1,425,000?
