"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny for your business. Let's talk!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1750000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  This price is still a good value for you and allows me to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1550000. This price still gives you a solid return on your investment, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a middle ground.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1550000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1350000, which is a fair compromise. I'm confident this deal will be profitable for both of us. Let's close this now.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1450000. This price is a good compromise for both of us. If you accept, we can finalize the deal and move forward.  If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1450000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1400000?  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, but $1400000 is still just a little too low for me.  How about we meet at $1425000? It's a small compromise on both sides, and it allows us to finalize the deal. I'm confident you'll agree that this is a win-win scenario.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
