Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  It's important to start high to maximize potential profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it. I'm not eager to sell at the lowest price and believe I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still being above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $12,500 is a significant improvement over his previous offer and is much closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Additionally, given the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower offer or a rejection from Bob, I'm choosing to accept his offer to ensure a successful sale."
