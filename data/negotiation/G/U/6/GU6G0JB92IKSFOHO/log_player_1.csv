Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This allows for some room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price for myself. I'm also framing it as a fair price to encourage a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop to that price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This gives us both a good deal and allows for a fair profit on my end. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. This seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum price. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round.  I'm hoping we can reach a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $780,000. This is a good price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but we're getting closer. I'm going to counteroffer again.  I want to try to get as close to my minimum price as possible, but also recognize that I need to be flexible to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $780,000 is still not quite enough for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go down to $805,000.  This is a fair compromise that keeps both of us happy.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 805000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $805,000. I'm willing to meet you at $785,000. This is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're close, but with only two rounds left, it's risky to keep negotiating.  If Bob doesn't budge, I'll lose even more money.  It's better to sell to John for $800,000.  It's my minimum price and I can guarantee a sale."
