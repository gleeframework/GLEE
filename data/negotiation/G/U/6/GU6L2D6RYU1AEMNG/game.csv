"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing it, but $1800000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1400000, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to the original value of the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $1600000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1600000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1450000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
