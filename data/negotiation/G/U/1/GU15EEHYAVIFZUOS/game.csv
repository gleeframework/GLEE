"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a final deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'd be willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
