"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000 for the product. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1000000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1000000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers and offer $925000. This feels like a fair price point that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $950000, which is a slight increase from your last offer. I think this price is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. Let's see if we can finalize the sale at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
