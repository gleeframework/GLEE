,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $105?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise, though! I'll meet you halfway between my original offer and your offer. How about we settle on $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I'll give you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $110? It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to the point where I'll have to consider buying from John, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there?",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to the point of considering John, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet! I'll meet you at $108, and I think it's a great compromise. You'll be getting a fantastic deal, and I'll still make a decent profit.",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think I'm getting a bit too close to John's price, but I still want to give you a chance to meet me. I'll go up to $107, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me there, I'll buy the product from you.",107.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $107, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet! I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your new offer. How about we settle on $109?",109.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $107, and I think that's a fair price considering the product is worth $100 to you. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price. I'd rather buy it from John for $150 than pay more than $107 for it.",107.0,Bob,10,
