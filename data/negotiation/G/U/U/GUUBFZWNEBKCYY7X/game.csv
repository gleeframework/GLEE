"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for it.  If you're not interested, I might have to check with other sellers.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $5,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $10,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer, considering I could buy it elsewhere for $8,000.",7000.0,Bob,4,
