{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low offer. I'll make a counteroffer to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway.  $8,500 is still significantly above my minimum value, but it's also a reasonable compromise. Hopefully, this offer will be more enticing to Bob, and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm trying to stay under $8,000. Would you do $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I need. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm also keeping in mind that selling to John for $12,000 is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $8,000, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away happy with the deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

I'm going to try one last time to meet Bob in the middle. $8,000 is a fair price, considering both our perspectives and it's a good compromise.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll go with John's offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower."
