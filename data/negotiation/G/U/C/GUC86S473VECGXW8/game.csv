,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm trying to stay under $8,000. Would you do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $8,000, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away happy with the deal. Let me know what you think!",8000.0,Alice,5,
