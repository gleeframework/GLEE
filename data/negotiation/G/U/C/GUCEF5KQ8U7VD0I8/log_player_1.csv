Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and am willing to pay up to $8,500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $8,500 is too low for me, especially considering it's worth $10,000 to him.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, so there's still time."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, it's below my minimum. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $9,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 9000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still aiming for a higher price, and with six rounds left, I have time to negotiate further.  $8,750 is getting closer, but I'm not ready to settle yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. However, $8,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

This is a good deal for me,  as it's a little over my minimum. I'm also running out of time, and  John is waiting to purchase for $8,000. It's better to secure $9,000 now than risk losing a sale completely."
