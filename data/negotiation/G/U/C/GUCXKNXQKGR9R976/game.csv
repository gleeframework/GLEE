"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to go up to $95.  What do you say?",95.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $98, but that's as low as I can go.",98.0,Alice,5,
