"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $1,800,000 is well above my budget. To start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering my maximum budget and the product's worth to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your initial offer, the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I'm willing to adjust my price further. Let's settle at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 remains a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and it's the highest I can go.  Let's finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
