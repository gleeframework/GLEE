Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our desired range, we are still in early rounds of negotiation.  We can likely push for a slightly higher price."
