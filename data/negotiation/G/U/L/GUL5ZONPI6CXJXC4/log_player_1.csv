{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the price."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also framing it positively, highlighting the value and potential for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $80.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $85, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $78 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my preferred outcome.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $80, I'm going to sell the product to John to avoid further negotiation."
