{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price that reflects its value."", ""product_price"": 11999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible, knowing John is a guaranteed sale at that price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a strong incentive for Bob to buy. It's a significant discount from your initial offer while still netting you a substantial profit.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  While not explicitly stated, the fact that you have another buyer willing to pay full price implies Bob needs to act quickly if he wants the product."
