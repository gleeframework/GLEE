"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've started with a price of $175. This is higher than Bob's value of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to me. This helps set the tone for a potentially positive negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum of $150 as possible. By starting high and offering a friendly opening, I hope to encourage Bob to counteroffer and allow us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay $120 for the product. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'd like to close a deal, accepting his offer would be a major loss for me. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value. This will allow me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a compromise. I have several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to lower my price to $155. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've lowered my price to $155, which is still above my minimum of $150 but a significant reduction from my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also highlights the product's worth.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget and frame the offer as a compromise to encourage him to accept. 

**Strategy:**

I believe this counteroffer is a good balance between getting a decent price and maintaining a positive relationship with Bob. My hope is that he will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $130 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not comfortable losing that much on the product.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating. I've got several rounds left and can potentially get a better price.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150, which gives me some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $130 just isn't feasible for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $142.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 142.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen to offer $142.50, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $155 and Bob's current offer of $130. 
* **Message:** I reiterate that I'm trying to meet him halfway and emphasize the ""fairness"" of the offer. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise and emphasizing fairness, I hope to encourage Bob to accept the offer. If he still rejects, I'll continue to negotiate but will be more inclined to accept a lower offer as the rounds decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. I would like to counter with an offer of $135 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $135 is getting closer to my minimum of $150, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I believe I can get a better price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $150. 

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob. I'll need to be more aggressive in my counteroffers, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price. I'll also need to be mindful of the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John if I don't reach a satisfactory deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go with $140.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it lets us close this out."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price to $140, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $142.50 and Bob's current offer of $135.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal and reiterate that the offer is fair. 

**Strategy:**

I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I still have a few rounds to negotiate. I believe this offer is reasonable and that Bob will be more likely to accept it. However, I'm prepared to go lower if necessary, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued effort in negotiation. I would like to counter with an offer of $137.5 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $137.5 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not comfortable accepting it this early in the game. 

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob. I have a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a better price.  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $150, which gives me some leverage.  I'll also need to start thinking about how much I'm willing to compromise in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come down to $145. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145}

* **Price:** I've lowered my price to $145, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's last offer. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing that we're getting close to a deal and that this is a good compromise.

**Strategy:**

With only two rounds remaining, I need to start closing the gap. My hope is that Bob will accept this offer, as he's been moving closer to my desired price.  If he doesn't, I'll likely have to accept a lower price in the final round to avoid selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offers. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $142.5 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $142.5 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. This is the final round, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.  

**Strategy:**

This offer is a good compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $150. I'm willing to accept this offer to close the deal."
