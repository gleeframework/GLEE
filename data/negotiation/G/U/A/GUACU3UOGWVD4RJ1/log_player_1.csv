Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $8,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers a lot of value, and I believe $17,000 is a fair price that reflects its worth.  What do you think?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. Could we meet somewhere around $10,000? It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $10,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's still a $2,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations risks losing the sale entirely. Each round is an opportunity cost.
* **Bird in Hand:**  John's offer is a good fallback, but Bob is a confirmed buyer right now."
