"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. Rejecting this offer and providing a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially secure a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $8,000.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer allows room for negotiation. While $8,000 is a lowball, it lets Alice know your target budget and leaves space for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers a lot of value, and I believe $17,000 is a fair price that reflects its worth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than both your target and John's offer. Rejecting and countering again keeps the negotiation open without committing to an unfavorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. Could we meet somewhere around $10,000? It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  In this round, we're being direct about our maximum budget while still aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. Offering $10,000 puts pressure on Alice by:

* **Signaling your limit:**  She knows you have an alternative and won't go higher.
* **Conveying seriousness:** A firm but fair offer shows you're ready to buy if she's reasonable.

This strategy aims for a quick resolution while avoiding the back-and-forth that could lead you closer to your fallback option with John."
