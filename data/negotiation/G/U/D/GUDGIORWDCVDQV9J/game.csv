"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but it falls quite a bit short of what I had in mind. This product offers unique value, and I believe a price of $2,000,000 is a fair reflection of that. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to find common ground. Let's continue this conversation.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product. What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap. I'm willing to stretch to $800,000. This is my final offer. It represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,6,
