"Alice, $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my budget limitations. Let's make this deal happen.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This reflects the product's value while considering your budget.",12500.0,Alice,5,
