"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his maximum budget of $8,000. He should attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is a better offer than $18,000, it's still above Bob's budget of $8,000. Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still rounds available, and a counteroffer might get Alice closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my budget limitations. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This reflects the product's value while considering your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $12,500 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate Alice down to his target price.
* **Guaranteed deal:** Buying from John guarantees Bob gets the product at his desired price, without the risk of further negotiations."
