"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $95 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering. There's room for negotiation since the product is worth $80 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $85, which is a fair price considering the product's worth to Alice ($80) and Bob's maximum budget ($120). This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation while still offering a substantial discount from Alice's initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than John's price of $120 and closer to Bob's desired price range. Continuing to negotiate might save a few more dollars, but the risk is that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a significantly higher price.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most pragmatic decision."
