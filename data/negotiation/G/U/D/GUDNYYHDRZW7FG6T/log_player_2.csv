This price reflects not only the value of the product but also the opportunity it presents for you. I trust this offer will be favorable and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but not ideal.** It's $500 cheaper than John's price, but still above your ideal price point. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Since Alice is motivated to sell and you're willing to pay more than her value, you can likely get a better price. 

By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or even explore other potential sellers."
