"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high.  It makes sense to negotiate and see if we can get a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's value, but $11,000 is a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:** We start by anchoring the negotiation lower, closer to our desired price range. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  Offering $9,000 shows willingness to negotiate and find a fair price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Alice's flexibility and sets the stage for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. How about we settle at $10,250?  It's a small step closer, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concession:** Alice is moving down in price, but very slowly.  This suggests there's room for more negotiation.
* **Still Above Target:** Even at $10,250, we're significantly above our ideal price and closer to our ""walk-away"" price with John.
* **Maintain Momentum:** We need to signal that we're serious about a lower price without appearing unreasonable.  Rejecting keeps the pressure on Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  I'm still quite a bit away from my budget. Would you consider $9,500?  I'm hoping to get this done today."",
 ""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Increment:** We're reducing our counteroffer in a smaller increment ($500 instead of $1000) to signal that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding ""I'm hoping to get this done today"" implies a potential deadline without being overly aggressive.
* **Maintaining Ground:** We're not dramatically moving from our previous offer, as we want to encourage Alice to make a more substantial move."
