"That's a bit too high for me, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay $100 for it. Would you be willing to go that low?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $130?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $117 for the product.  This way, we both get a fair price.",117.0,Alice,5,
