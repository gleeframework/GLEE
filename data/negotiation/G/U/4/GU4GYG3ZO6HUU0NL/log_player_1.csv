Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer will help me gauge Bob's interest and potentially his perceived value of the product.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  The price is not too high that it would immediately scare Bob away, but it's also not so low that I leave a lot of profit on the table. 
* **Setting a friendly tone:**  I'm using a casual and friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit too high for me, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay $100 for it. Would you be willing to go that low? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Although Bob is interested, I believe I can get a better price from him. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and hopefully reach a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $130?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Maintaining a friendly tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly and open to finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $115.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:**  Bob's offer of $115 is getting closer to my minimum price of $120, but it's still not enough. 
* **Potential for a better price:**  I'm confident that with a little more negotiation, I can reach a price that's more favorable to me.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  By rejecting his offer, I can counteroffer and hopefully convince Bob to go a little higher."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $117 for the product.  This way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 117} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** My counteroffer is a small increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm framing it as a ""fair price"" and a split of the difference, emphasizing the potential for a win-win situation.
* **Closing the deal:** This counteroffer is a strategic move to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the sale."
