"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1500000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1750000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1625000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1625000. I'm going to counteroffer at $1700000. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're not willing to go any lower than $1700000.  While I'd prefer to pay less, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1650000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
