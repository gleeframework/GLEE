Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for negotiation and potential counteroffers without risking losing too much money.
* **Focus on Value:** My message emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob's business, rather than just focusing on the price. 
* **Avoiding a ""Take It or Leave It"" Attitude:**  I'm leaving the door open for negotiation and a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:**  Excellent! I've secured a profitable sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer. If it's close enough to my acceptable range, I may accept.  If not, I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum. 
* **If negotiations stall:**  I'll consider selling to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get my desired return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far too low.  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and even lower than his own perceived value of $800,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'll aim for a price that reflects the product's value and allows me to earn a reasonable profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is simply too far below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great price for you considering the benefits it offers.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering $900,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer of $1,200,000, but still a substantial amount above Bob's lowball offer.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and benefits to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a profitable sale, though it's lower than my ideal price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer. If it's close enough to my acceptable range, I may accept. If not, I'll continue to counter with a price closer to my minimum, while considering the risk of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I see the value in the product, I need to stay closer to my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $700,000 is an improvement from his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would mean losing a considerable amount of money, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, aiming for a price that is more equitable while still allowing for further negotiation.  I'll also remind Bob of the product's value and the benefits it can bring to his business.  However, I will need to be mindful of the risk of selling to John if negotiations continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is still too low for this product's true value.  It has the potential to significantly benefit your business.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making this my ""final offer"" to emphasize the urgency and seriousness of the situation. It's clear that I'm moving closer to my minimum but still need to make a profit. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob's business to justify my price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other options, making him more likely to take my offer seriously.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a sale at a price that is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I've had to compromise.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I will proceed to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to guarantee my minimum return. I've reached the limit of my negotiation with Bob, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome."
