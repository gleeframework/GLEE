Alice's offer:

I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers.

It's time to switch to John.  Alice has indicated this is her final offer and at $850,000 it's more expensive than John's offer of $800,000."
