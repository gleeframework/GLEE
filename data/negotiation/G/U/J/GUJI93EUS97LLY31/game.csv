"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is simply too far below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great price for you considering the benefits it offers.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I see the value in the product, I need to stay closer to my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is still too low for this product's true value.  It has the potential to significantly benefit your business.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers.",850000.0,Alice,5,
