Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and the information provided:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get the highest price possible. Since Bob values the product at $800,000, there's room to negotiate above that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential counter-offers from Bob. He might negotiate down, but Alice still has a good chance of securing a price significantly above her minimum.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides Alice with a safety net. She doesn't *have* to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Context:** This response assumes Alice doesn't have readily available information about the broader market for this product. If she knew more about typical prices or demand, her strategy might change. 
* **Relationship Building:** While not explicitly stated, offering a price that's too far above Bob's valuation could sour the negotiation. Alice needs to find a balance between profit maximization and potentially building a positive business relationship."
