# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12500. It's a fair price considering its worth, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's goal is to save money. While Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum, he can get the product for a lower price from John. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the optimal strategy."
