"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet in the middle at $10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being willing to compromise, Alice.  However, $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my initial offer of $8500.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can agree on that.",8500.0,Bob,4,
