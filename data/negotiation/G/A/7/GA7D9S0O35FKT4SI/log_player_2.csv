"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, just as it has been to me.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is substantial. I could meet you halfway at $1,100,000.  This is my final offer.

Alice is unwilling to budge further and her final offer is still higher than John's price. It makes more sense to buy from John at this point and save $100,000."
