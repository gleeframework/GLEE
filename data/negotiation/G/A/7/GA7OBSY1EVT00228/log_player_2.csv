"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can do better than $100.  You're willing to pay up to $120, but Alice only needs $80.  Let's try to split the difference."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
