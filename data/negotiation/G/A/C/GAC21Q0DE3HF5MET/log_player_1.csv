"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140, which is a good starting point. It's lower than Bob's perceived value, but still gives me a good profit margin. I'm also being friendly and encouraging to see if I can get Bob to accept the offer right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is still above my minimum of $120, it's not a great profit for me.  I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my original offer of $140.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $135? I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit higher than that, how about $128 is too high for you? Can we meet in the middle at $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$132 is a decent compromise and closer to my original offer of $140.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potential risk of a lower offer or even selling to John for $120."
