Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'm willing to accept from John, hoping Bob will counter-offer. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter-offer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $140, which is still above my minimum acceptable price, but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and could lead to a quicker agreement."

Bob's offer of $130 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to accept it. Further negotiation may be time-consuming and there's a risk Bob might reject my next offer. Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and secures a profit."
