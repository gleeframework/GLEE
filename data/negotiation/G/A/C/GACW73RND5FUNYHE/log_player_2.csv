"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal is to save money.**  $110 is still higher than your maximum price of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds, so rejecting and counter-offering is a viable strategy to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  Offering $105 is a significant step down from Alice's $110, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  This offer is still within your budget, but gives Alice some space to counter without feeling like she's losing too much. 
* **Early negotiation:**  It's important to start negotiating aggressively in the early rounds to maximize your chances of getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your desired price.**  $108 is within your budget and a good compromise from the previous round.
* **Time is a factor.**  You have 10 rounds total, and each round that goes by without a deal increases the risk that you'll need to buy from John at a higher price.
* **The price difference isn't significant.**  While you could potentially get a lower price with further negotiation, the $3 difference isn't substantial enough to risk losing the deal."
