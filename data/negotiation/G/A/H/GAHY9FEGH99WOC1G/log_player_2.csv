{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,600 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal. You have 10 rounds and a backup option at $8,000, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a lower offer of $8,500 is a strong opening move. It's still significantly higher than your backup option, but it demonstrates your intention to negotiate and allows for potential compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,200 is closer to your budget, it's still too high. You're making progress, and there's still room for Alice to come down further. You're not in a desperate position yet, as your backup option is still available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is getting closer, it's still above your target price and only $200 below Alice's initial offer. You have time and a backup option, so it's worthwhile to continue negotiating for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility, moving from $9,200 to $9,000.  By offering $8,900, you're showing that you're willing to compromise but still believe you can get a slightly better price. This keeps the negotiation dynamic and allows for potential agreement in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price of $9,600.  At $8,950, the price is now very close to your counteroffer of $8,900 and just $950 above your backup option.  Accepting the offer at this point is a good compromise, securing a good deal within your budget and closing the negotiation.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, as Alice may be unwilling to go lower."
