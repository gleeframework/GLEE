"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000? I think that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $950,000? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to make a profit, and I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  How about we settle at $800,000? That's the most I can offer, but I think it's a fair deal considering the market value.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $800,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $900,000? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",900000.0,Alice,5,
