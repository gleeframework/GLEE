Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum price of $8,000, but it still leaves room for Bob to get a good deal at $12,000. This strategy maximizes your chance of getting a higher price while also minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
