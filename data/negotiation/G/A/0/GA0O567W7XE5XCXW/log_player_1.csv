"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering a price that's above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob ($120) will hopefully encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By not going for the full $120, I'm setting the stage for a back and forth that might lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum ($80), I'm still aiming to earn more. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:** By rejecting, I retain the upper hand in the negotiation. 
* **Potential for Better Outcome:** I believe I can likely push Bob higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? This way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle (sort of):**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $95 is still above my minimum price of $80, so I'm not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:**  Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my desired price range and significantly higher than selling to John.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's risky to continue negotiating and potentially miss out on a good deal.
* **Risk of Lower Offer:**  There's a chance Bob might lower his offer in the next round, or even reject my counteroffer, potentially leaving me with no choice but to sell to John for $80.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
