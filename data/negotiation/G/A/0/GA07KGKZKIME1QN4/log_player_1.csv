Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate. I'll be watching for his reaction and ready to adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but not that far down. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  I'm also aware that John is a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000.  It's more profitable to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
