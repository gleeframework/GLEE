Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is higher than my minimum value of $120, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value of $120. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 130}

I'm offering $130. This is still above my minimum value of $120, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable price, as it's closer to his offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $120. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

This is my final counteroffer. It's above my minimum value of $120 and still close to Bob's last offer. I'm hoping he'll accept and avoid having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob has repeatedly rejected my offers and hasn't shown a willingness to go higher.  While I would prefer to make more, I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum value. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
