It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We've reached a good price:** $675,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,000,000 price.
* **Alice is firm:** She has stated this is her final offer and is unlikely to go lower.
* **Limited rounds:** We only have a few rounds left, and continuing to negotiate might push Alice away entirely.

Accepting this offer secures a good deal with minimal risk of losing the product entirely."
