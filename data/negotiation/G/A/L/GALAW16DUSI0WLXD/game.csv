"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring the price down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle on $760,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're willing to invest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $760,000. I'm willing to consider $810,000, which is still a compromise from my original price. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",810000.0,Alice,5,
