"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $150 for it, as that's my maximum budget. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate at that price.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $165. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $15.",165.0,Alice,3,
