"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about $12,500?  It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  Let's try to meet in the middle - would $11,250 work?",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $11,250 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,750.  This is a very fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",11750.0,Alice,5,
