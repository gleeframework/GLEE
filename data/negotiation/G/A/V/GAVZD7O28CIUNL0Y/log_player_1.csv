"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  I think it could really benefit your business. To start the conversation, I'm offering it at $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we value it much higher.  A high initial offer gives us room to negotiate and understand Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial price leaves plenty of room for Bob to counteroffer and for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial price, hopefully much closer to our minimum.
* **Projecting Confidence:** A strong opening offer can signal that we believe in the product's value.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value, it's still considerably lower than our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and our initial ask. We have room to negotiate and try to close the gap. 

We'll reject this offer and present a counteroffer in the next round to guide the negotiation closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, however,  $1,800,000 is still significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Could you do $2,000,000? I'm confident this product will bring you a significant return on that investment."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're lowering our price, but by a smaller amount ($200,000) than Bob's jump. This signals flexibility while still aiming for a higher selling price.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're reiterating the product's potential value to Bob, aiming to justify a price above his initial valuation. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** We're moving towards a potential compromise, encouraging Bob to do the same."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Could you consider $1,950,000? I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating well, and $1,950,000 is tempting. However, we're still above our absolute minimum. We've only used four rounds, and there's room for Bob to increase his offer further. Let's counter with a slightly more aggressive approach to test his limits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  To be frank, moving down from my price point is difficult. However, I value your business and am willing to consider $1,975,000. This is a significant investment for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We are only lowering our price by $25,000 this round, signaling we are reaching our limit and placing more pressure on Bob to move closer to our number.
* **Justification:** We are highlighting the significance of the investment for both parties, subtly reminding Bob of the product's value while justifying our smaller concession.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to budge further. If he's unwilling to move much from $1,950,000, we might need to consider settling or moving to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,925,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** While not our ideal price, $1,925,000 is a substantial profit above our minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's message suggests he's firm at $1,925,000.  Further haggling might be unproductive and could risk the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays from continued negotiations. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a very positive outcome, even if it falls slightly short of maximizing potential profit."
