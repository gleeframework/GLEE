"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. I believe it holds immense potential for you. Given its worth, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,800,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $2,050,000?",2050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly further. How about we settle on $1,975,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my maximum budget, but I still think $1,975,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",1950000.0,Bob,6,
