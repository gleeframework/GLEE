Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $18,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $16,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500.

Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and while I could try to negotiate him up a little, it's getting too risky. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to potentially end up with even less from Bob."
