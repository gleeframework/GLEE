"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $1,200,000 is far above his budget.  He should counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, the value of this product is quite significant, and $850,000 is a substantial deviation from what I believe it's worth. I'm willing to come down slightly, but not to that extent. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

While $1,000,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial one, it's still above Bob's target price. He should reject the offer and counteroffer again.  He can try to get closer to his desired price of $800,000."

This represents a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
