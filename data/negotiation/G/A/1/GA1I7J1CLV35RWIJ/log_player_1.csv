Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I think it would be incredibly useful for you. I'm asking for $15,000, given its true worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible. Since we know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting higher gives room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price well above your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer doesn't have to be the final price. It's a starting point for negotiation.
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, which might make Bob more amenable to a higher price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer outright.  A different approach could involve a smaller margin, increasing the likelihood of a sale to Bob."
