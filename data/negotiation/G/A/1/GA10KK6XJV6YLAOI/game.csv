"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential return on investment.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, $1,400,000 is below its true worth.  I could consider $1,750,000. This still leaves room for a significant return on your investment.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value and my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
