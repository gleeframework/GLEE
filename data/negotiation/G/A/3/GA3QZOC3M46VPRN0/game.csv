"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you, but I'm open to negotiations if you have a different idea in mind. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a budget in mind, Bob, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product has to offer. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle from there?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $13000. I can offer it to you for $12500, which is closer to your budget and still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm afraid $12500 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'll offer $9000 for the product. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,6,
