{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and it's significantly less than your minimum value.  This will likely encourage Bob to engage in negotiations rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is more than Bob's initial assessment, it's still below my minimum value.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $10,500?  This is a great deal for you, and it's fair for me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,000? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm confident that John will buy the product for my desired price."
