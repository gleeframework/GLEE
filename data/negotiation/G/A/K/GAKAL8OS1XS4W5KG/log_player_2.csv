* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing you can get the product from John for $1,000,000 gives you leverage to hold out for a better deal.

* **Keeping a reasonable margin:**  $925,000 still leaves a decent margin for you while being significantly less than John's price.
* **Time is running out:** With fewer rounds left, you need to start closing the gap to avoid buying from John.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Time is running out:** You have only three rounds left, and you need to be strategic to get the best deal.
* **Potentially a better deal:**  You've already made significant progress in negotiations, and there's a chance you can get Alice to accept a price closer to your target.

* **One round left:** You have only one round left to negotiate, and it's unlikely Alice will come down significantly enough to make it worthwhile.
* **Guaranteed price:** Buying from John guarantees you the product at a known price, eliminating the risk of further negotiation. 

**Next step:** It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially with only one round left. Buying from John is the most logical choice."
