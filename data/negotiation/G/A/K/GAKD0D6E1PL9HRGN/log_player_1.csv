I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident that Bob will find this price attractive, as it's still below the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,300,000 is a decent offer, I am still confident that I can get a better price.  I am willing to continue negotiating with Bob to try and reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves a good profit margin for me. I believe this price is fair and will hopefully be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for $1,250,000. I'm willing to risk a potential stalemate and continue negotiating.  I believe I can push for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still providing me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

It seems Bob is not budging much further. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer, $1,280,000 is still a good deal for me. I'm accepting Bob's offer, as it's above my minimum acceptable price and there's no guarantee I can get a better offer in the future."
