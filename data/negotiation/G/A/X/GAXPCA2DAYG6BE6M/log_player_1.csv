"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with an offer significantly higher than our minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly anchoring the negotiation around a higher price point.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  While starting high, we signal a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value and significantly below our minimum.  We have plenty of room to negotiate and time before considering John's offer. Rejecting keeps the door open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,000,000 falls significantly short of the product's true value and potential. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,450,000. This represents a significant reduction on my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to find a fair agreement."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** We want to show flexibility while still staying well above our minimum. This sizable decrease from our initial offer ($150,000) might encourage Bob to engage more seriously. 
* **Reinforce Value:**  We reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price point and avoid getting anchored too close to Bob's initial offer. 
* **Continued Willingness to Negotiate:** The tone remains open to finding a compromise, signaling that further negotiation is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  While I'm interested, $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). While we could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting ensures we make a profitable deal and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether if negotiations stall."
