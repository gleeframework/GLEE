"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground to make this deal work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,000,000 falls significantly short of the product's true value and potential. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,450,000. This represents a significant reduction on my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to find a fair agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  While I'm interested, $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
