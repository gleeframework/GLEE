"Hi Bob, I'm selling a valuable product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20000. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $15000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a bit higher. How about $18000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and still gives you a great deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $16500.  This price is still fair given the value of the product, and it's a significant step towards your offer. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $16500 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to come in a little lower. Would you consider $16000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,6,
