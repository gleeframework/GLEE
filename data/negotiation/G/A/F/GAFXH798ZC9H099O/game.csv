"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Is there any way we could come to an agreement within this price range?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $15,000?  This would still be a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $12,500? This would still be a significant saving for you, and it would give me a price I can work with.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference at $11,500? This is a fair compromise for both of us. I'm open to finalizing the deal at this price.",11500.0,Alice,7,
