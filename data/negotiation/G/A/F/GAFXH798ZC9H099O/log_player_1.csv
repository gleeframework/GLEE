"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I know it's a good deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Is there any way we could come to an agreement within this price range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 9 rounds left, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $15,000?  This would still be a great deal for you considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $10,000 is the maximum I can afford for this product. Would it be possible to reach an agreement at this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still stubbornly sticking to his $10,000 offer. While I'm running out of rounds, selling to John for $15,000 is still a better option than accepting Bob's offer. I'll continue to try and negotiate with Bob in the hopes of getting a price closer to my minimum, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $12,500? This would still be a significant saving for you, and it would give me a price I can work with."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I believe $11,000 would be a fair price. I hope we can reach an agreement at this level. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a slightly better deal. I have 4 rounds left and I'm willing to risk a couple more to try and get closer to my $12,500 counteroffer.  However, if Bob doesn't budge in the next round, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference at $11,500? This is a fair compromise for both of us. I'm open to finalizing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I am willing to consider $11,000 as a fair price for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still holding firm at $11,000.  With only two rounds left, the risk of not getting a better offer from Bob is too high.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures a successful sale."
