Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90?  It's a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm going to make one last offer: $82.  It's fair to both of us, and it'll allow us to finalize this deal.  Let's make it happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $82.  While she might be bluffing, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price and forcing you to buy from John at $80 anyway.  You've negotiated well, but your best move now is to secure the $80 price with John."
