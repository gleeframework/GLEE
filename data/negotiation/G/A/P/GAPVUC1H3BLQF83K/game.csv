"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $7,500? I think that's a fair offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,000? This is a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Alice,5,
