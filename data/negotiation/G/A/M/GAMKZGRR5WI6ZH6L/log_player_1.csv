I'm offering Bob the product for $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves me with a decent profit. I believe this price is attractive enough to entice Bob to accept, but also gives me room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly less than my ideal price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with my own.  I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,000. This is still a significant discount from my minimum value, but I'm hoping that by moving closer to his offer, I can close the deal without having to settle for his original price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a better offer than the last one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value and even lower than my last counter offer.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation.  I'm not eager to sell to John for $15,000, but if this round doesn't go in my favor, I'll be forced to accept that offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,000. I'm getting closer to his price point, but still holding out for a better deal. I'm hoping this offer will be enough to close the negotiation. If Bob rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's latest offer is below my minimum value.  It's clear that we're not going to find a price that works for both of us.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum value, I'm going to sell the product to him.  It's not my ideal scenario, but it's the best outcome for me in this situation."
