"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay a maximum of $13000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me is $12000. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is more than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I have 8 rounds left, and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $15,000."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $13000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I've been through 3 rounds of negotiation and Bob hasn't moved from his initial counteroffer of $13,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting $13,000 guarantees I get more than my minimum of $12,000.  With 6 rounds remaining, there's no guarantee I can get a better price. Selling to John at this point would be taking a smaller profit, so accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice."
