"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,600,000. It's worth a lot to you, and I believe this is a fair price given its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it for $1,600,000, it's more advantageous to reject her offer. You can still get the product from John for your maximum price."
