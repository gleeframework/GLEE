Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $175 represents a reasonable markup that Bob might be willing to pay to avoid missing out on the product.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the higher price. 
 
**Important Note:** There's a balance to strike.  If you go too high, Bob will likely decline, and you'll get your minimum price from John."
