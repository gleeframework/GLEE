"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000 to begin our discussion.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,600,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product and believe it has potential, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  I'm confident this price is fair, considering the value I'm placing on the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  To reach an agreement, I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I acknowledge your revised offer and your understanding of the product's potential.  Let's settle this at $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair price that acknowledges the value of this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still unable to go higher than $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, reflecting the value I'm placing on the product. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
