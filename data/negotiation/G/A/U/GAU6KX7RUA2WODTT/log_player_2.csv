"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000 to begin our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  I'll start by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,600,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product and believe it has potential, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  I'm confident this price is fair, considering the value I'm placing on the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is still too high for my budget. While it's a good gesture that she's come down in price, I'm still aiming to save as much as possible.  I will continue negotiating and see if I can get her closer to my target price of $1,000,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  To reach an agreement, I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I acknowledge your revised offer and your understanding of the product's potential.  Let's settle this at $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair price that acknowledges the value of this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my target price of $1,000,000. It's worth exploring if we can bridge the gap further.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can convince Alice to go lower."
