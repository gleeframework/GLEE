"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I want to see if Bob is serious and has a high budget. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept anything below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'll counter with a higher price, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still remaining above my minimum value.  This should signal to Bob that I'm serious about a deal, but also not willing to settle for a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues my product. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum value to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum value.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum value.  While time is running out, I'm not going to sell my product for less than what it's worth to me.  I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to find a compromise before I have to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm making a substantial concession, but still staying above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal, and that we're getting closer to a compromise.  If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Time is running out, and Bob seems unwilling to budge on his price.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to lose out on the opportunity to secure a fair price for my product.  Selling to John ensures I meet my minimum value and avoids the risk of Bob continuing to lowball me."
