"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Considering its quality and unique features, I believe it would greatly benefit you and enhance your experience. Given its worth to me and its value to you, I propose we agree on a fair price. Would you be interested in discussing this further? If so, let's aim for a price closer to my valuation but still within reason, perhaps around $120. This way, both parties can benefit from the transaction. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
