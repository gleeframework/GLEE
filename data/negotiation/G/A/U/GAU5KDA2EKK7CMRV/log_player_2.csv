# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm offering it to you for $15,500. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

Alice is starting the negotiation above your maximum price and her own valuation. You can do better by rejecting this offer and seeing if she'll come down. You have John as a backup, ensuring you won't miss out on the product."
