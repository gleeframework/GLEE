(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:** 

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals my serious intent to negotiate and establishes a starting point.  We'll see if Alice is willing to come down that much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target. There are still rounds left, and I want to explore if I can squeeze out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm willing to compromise but still trying to stay below my maximum.  $7,500 is a good middle ground, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it to avoid further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $8,500 is still a bit high. I'm not willing to pay that much, especially since John is offering the same product for $8,000.  However, I'm not going to rush to John yet. There's still room for negotiation with Alice, and I might be able to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a final counteroffer at John's price. This is a ""take it or leave it"" situation. If Alice accepts, I save money compared to John's price. If she rejects, I can go to John without any further loss."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is only $200 less than John's price.  Since we're in Round 7, there's not much room for further negotiation, and I'm not confident I can get Alice down to my target price.  At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal with John."
