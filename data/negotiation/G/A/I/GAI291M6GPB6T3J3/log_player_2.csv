"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$5,000 is a great price, but we have 10 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. There's no reason to rush into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This signals my intent to negotiate and sets a baseline for further discussion.  I'm aiming to find a price that's fair for both of us, while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $4,000 is a good price, I still believe there's potential for a better deal. We've already established a range for the product price. By rejecting this offer, I can continue the negotiation and aim for a price closer to my desired $3,000 range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility by reducing her offer to $4,000. I'm increasing my counteroffer to $3,500, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my initial target. This allows for further negotiation and hopefully a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $4,200 is close to my previous counteroffer of $3,500, and significantly better than John's price of $12,000. We're approaching a reasonable deal, and with only five rounds left, it's in my best interest to accept this offer to secure the product.  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but also a chance that Alice might increase her price again.  It's a calculated risk, but at this point, $4,200 is a good deal for me."
