"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable item that I'm sure you'll find very appealing. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is quite high.  I'm interested in the product but can only afford $600000 right now.  Let me know if that's a starting point for us.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $600000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, or we can discuss a compromise around $1000000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1000000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go to $750000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $750000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $900000 to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $950000?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high.  How about we meet at $850000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.  Let me know if that works for you.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and my target of $1200000. How about we meet at $1050000? This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
