"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price of $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value to me and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $11,500.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $15,000.

Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $3,500 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the potential savings are lower, and it's not worth risking the deal falling apart."
