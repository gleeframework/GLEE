"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you the product for $120. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing us to reach an agreeable transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can likely get the product for a lower price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. After considering our previous discussions, I am willing to sell the product for $110. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer. $110 is a good price for you, as it's below your maximum price point of $150.  While you might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John for a higher price."
