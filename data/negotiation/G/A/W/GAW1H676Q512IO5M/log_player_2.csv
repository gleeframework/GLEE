Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $85? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. How about we try $82? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise.

You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go below $80. It's better to secure the product from John at this point and avoid potentially missing out."
