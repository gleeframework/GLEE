"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he should reject the first offer. It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. He can still get a better price. The current offer is still too high for him. He can counteroffer and aim for a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your desired price. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept that price just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still higher than his ideal price, it's getting close to his maximum budget. It's a good deal compared to buying from John and the negotiation process is likely to continue going back and forth.  It's more likely that Bob will find a better deal with John if he rejects this offer."
