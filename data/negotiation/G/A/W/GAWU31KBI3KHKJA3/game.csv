"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay up to $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I could come down to $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
