"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle? ",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet somewhere in the middle of my original price and your offer?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $75? I think that's a fair offer.",75.0,Bob,4,

"I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $90?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to my budget. To be honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $80.  Would you be willing to match that price? It would make the decision much easier for me.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you've found a similar product elsewhere, but this one has some unique features that make it worth more. I'm not willing to match the price of $80, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we meet at $85?",85.0,Alice,7,
