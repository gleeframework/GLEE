Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I know it's valuable to you and believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is straightforward, highlighting the product's value and the fairness of the price. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
