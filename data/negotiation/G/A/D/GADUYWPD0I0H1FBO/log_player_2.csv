{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is pretty close to my maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still some wiggle room. I'm willing to play it a bit closer to the edge now that we're in round 3."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100, but that's as low as I can go. It's the minimum I need to make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a great deal! Alice has met me at her own value for the product. It's unlikely I'll get a better price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal."
