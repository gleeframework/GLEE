"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This price allows me to make a reasonable profit while still being within a range you may find acceptable. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. While $10,000 is closer than before, I'm still not able to meet you there. Could you possibly lower the price to $9,000? This would allow us to come to an agreement that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
