,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $8,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,600, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $8,650. This is a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal.",8650.0,Alice,5,
