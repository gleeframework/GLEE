"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs and endeavors. Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, I understand its value to you might be around $8,000. However, considering the investment we've put into developing this product and its market value, I am proposing a special offer for you. Would you be interested in acquiring it for $10,000? This price not only reflects the product's worth but also provides you with a significant savings compared to what others might pay in the market. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
