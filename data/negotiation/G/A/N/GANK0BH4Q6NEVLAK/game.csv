"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth at least $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1400000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is too far below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. That's a significant discount from my original offer and still reflects the value of this product. Let's see if we can close the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1100000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
