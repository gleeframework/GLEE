"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to him, hoping to make the offer more appealing.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about $9,500? This would be a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but staying below my minimum. I'm also highlighting the fairness of the offer, hoping to make it more palatable to Bob. I'm confident I can close the deal at a price closer to my target with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9000. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum, and I'm already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  I'd rather secure a sale now than risk further rejection and potentially having to sell to John at a lower price later."
