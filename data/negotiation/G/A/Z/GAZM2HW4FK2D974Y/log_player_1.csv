"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $175, a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high as to be immediately rejected out of hand. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and presenting the offer as a ""great deal.""
* **Opening for Negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to respond and opens the door for counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I have room to negotiate and can likely secure a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Selling to John is not optimal:**  While John is a guaranteed buyer, a successful negotiation with Bob could potentially yield a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $145? That would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my minimum:** I'm moving closer to my $150 minimum while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasize fair compromise:**  Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" can make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  I'm actively trying to reach an agreement rather than stalling or immediately selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I am willing to go up to $130 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise between our budgets. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum, $130 is still below my threshold of $150.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** There's still room to negotiate further. I can likely get a higher price by making another counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is not the best choice yet:** While John offers a guaranteed $150, I can potentially get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $140. This would be a fantastic deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm narrowing the gap between our offers, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasizing the deal:** I'm highlighting the value proposition for Bob, making it appealing.
* **Urgency:** The message suggests a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept the offer. 

This strategy aims to create a sense of momentum and get Bob closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your offer and I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $135 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my $150 minimum. 
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  With only four rounds remaining, there's still a chance I can get a better offer from Bob.
* **John's offer is still a safety net:**  Selling to John guarantees me $150, but I'm not willing to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $135 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $142. This is a great price for a fantastic product, and it's only two rounds before I have to consider other options.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 142}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm  reducing the gap between our offers, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Emphasize urgency and alternatives:**  Mentioning the limited rounds and the possibility of turning to John creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision. 
* **Highlight the product's value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $142 is a good price.
* **Focus on compromise:**  I'm trying to frame the offer as a mutually beneficial compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to pay $138 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $138
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Two rounds remaining:** With only two rounds left, there's a high chance Bob will continue to haggle, potentially not reaching my desired price.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a significant risk that Bob won't meet my minimum in the remaining rounds, making John the safer option.

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's better to guarantee my minimum than risk ending up with a lower offer."
