Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $97. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $102. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $102. Accepting this offer gets you the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
