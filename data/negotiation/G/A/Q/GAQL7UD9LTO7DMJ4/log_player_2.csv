"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I believe holds significant value for your business.  I understand it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,250,000. This is a price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know what you think.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
