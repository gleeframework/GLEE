"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you do $90? That would make it worth it for me.",90.0,Alice,3,

"You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I could come down to $85, but that's my absolute limit.",85.0,Alice,5,
