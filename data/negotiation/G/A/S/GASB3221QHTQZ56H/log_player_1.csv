I'm going to sell to John.  Bob is stuck at $1,325,000, and I only have two rounds left.  While I would prefer to get more, selling to John will still get me $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  I don't want to risk losing out entirely by continuing to negotiate with Bob and getting nowhere."
