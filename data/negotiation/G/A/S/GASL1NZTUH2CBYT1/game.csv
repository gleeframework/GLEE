"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, $1800000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1900000.  This reflects the value I see in this product and my desire to reach an agreement with you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
