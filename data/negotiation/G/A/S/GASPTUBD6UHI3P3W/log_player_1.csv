Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you'll still make a profit if Bob accepts.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his counteroffer and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product's value, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I can still do better.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,375,000?  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I'd like to propose $1,360,000 as a compromise. This still saves you some money while bringing us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,360,000 is a good compromise that's still above my minimum acceptable price. There's a chance Bob might walk away if I counteroffer again, and I don't want to risk losing this deal."
