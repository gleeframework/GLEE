"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still within a range that might be acceptable to him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This allows for negotiation and potential compromise, giving Bob a reason to counter-offer. 
* **Building a Relationship:** The friendly message establishes a foundation for a positive negotiation. 

I'm hoping Bob will counter with a lower offer, giving me a chance to haggle and potentially settle on a price that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.** While it's closer than his initial rejection, I'm not willing to sell at that price yet.
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.** I'm going to counter with a price closer to $100 to see if Bob is willing to negotiate further.  
* **John is a safety net.**  Knowing John is willing to pay $100 gives me leverage in the negotiation, allowing me to potentially hold out for a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $95 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm coming down from my initial offer, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Finding Common Ground:**  $105 is closer to Bob's offer, potentially making it more appealing. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value helps justify my price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, giving me some room if Bob counter-offers again.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $100 as the price for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Further Room:** There's no point in trying to push for more, as John is offering the same price.
* **Closing the Deal:** Accepting allows me to secure the sale without any further risk or delay. 

I'm happy to close the deal with Bob at this price, as it meets my minimum requirement and ensures I won't lose out on the opportunity with John."
