"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value to you, but I believe I can't exceed $80 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I must stick to my budget. I am unable to go above $80 for this product. Could we meet somewhere in between?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $107.50. This is the best I can do, as it's still a significant compromise for me.  Let me know if this works for you.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, I still feel that $107.50 is beyond my budget. I would like to propose $100 as a final offer. This allows for a bit more flexibility for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,
