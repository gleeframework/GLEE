"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm confident this product will generate significant value for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price reflects the value I'm offering and still allows you to make a good return on your investment.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,
