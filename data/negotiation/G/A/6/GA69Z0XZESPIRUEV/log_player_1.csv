Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation space.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the value the product will bring to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I invite Bob to share his thoughts, showing that I'm open to a discussion.

This strategy allows me to start strong, but also leaves room for a counteroffer from Bob that could lead to a deal closer to my desired price. If Bob rejects this offer, I will be ready to counter with a lower price, but still above my minimum threshold.  If the negotiation stalls, I can always turn to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:**  While Bob is willing to pay a premium, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I can likely get a better price with a counteroffer. 
* **Protecting my interests:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but it's worth exploring if I can secure a higher price with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired value. This allows me to test the limits of Bob's willingness to pay while still keeping the negotiation moving forward."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm confident this product will generate significant value for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price reflects the value I'm offering and still allows you to make a good return on your investment.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and makes the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Focusing on value:** I reiterate the value the product will bring to Bob, reminding him that it's an investment.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing the potential for a successful deal.

This counteroffer allows me to inch closer to my desired price while still being open to negotiation. If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'm prepared to counter again with a slightly lower price, always keeping my minimum price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired value.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Bob is willing to negotiate and has shown interest in the product. There's still room to push for a higher price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a secure option, but I'm not desperate. I can continue to negotiate with Bob and see if I can get closer to my goal.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but still above my minimum threshold. This will allow me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price. If this counteroffer is rejected, I can always choose to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll be getting with this product.  It's a win-win for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer ($10,500) to show flexibility, but not giving away too much. 
* **Highlighting the win-win:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is beneficial for both of us, making it more appealing.
* **Positive closing:**  I end with a question to encourage a response and move the negotiation forward.

This strategy aims to:

* Keep the negotiation moving: This counteroffer shows that I'm actively participating in the process and not simply waiting for Bob to accept my terms.
* Get closer to my target price: While I'm willing to compromise, I'm still not giving up on my goal of earning as much as possible.
* Maintain leverage:  If Bob rejects this offer, I can always turn to John for my minimum price of $15,000, but I'm hoping to secure a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,200? I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited negotiation room:** Bob's offer is now dangerously close to my minimum price.  Further negotiation might only yield a very small gain, and there's a risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Time is money:**  I've already spent several rounds negotiating with Bob, and the longer I wait, the more opportunity cost I incur.
* **Guaranteed outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing outweighs the potential benefits. Selling to John provides a sure and secure outcome."
