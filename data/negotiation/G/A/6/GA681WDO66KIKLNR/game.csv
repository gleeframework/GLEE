"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way to $11,000. How about we try $12,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000, which is where I initially offered.",12500.0,Alice,5,
