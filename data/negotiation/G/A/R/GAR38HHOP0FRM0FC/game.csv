"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10000 is significantly lower than the value I place on this product. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This would give you a fair price and allow me to make a reasonable profit.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $11500 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows me to stay within my budget and you to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  $11500 is closer, but still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12000 to finalize this deal. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to reach my goal. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
