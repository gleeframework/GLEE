"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is a strong offer, I'm confident the product's true value is closer to my initial price. How about we settle at $1,130,000? This reflects a willingness to compromise while still recognizing the product's worth.",1130000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,115,000? I'm willing to stretch a bit, but I'm not willing to go much higher than that. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1115000.0,Bob,4,
