Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so he would be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **My Value:** My minimum value is $800,000, as that is what I can get from John.
* **Negotiation:** By offering $1,000,000, I am leaving room for negotiation, allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while still earning significantly more than my minimum. 

This approach aims to maximize my profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
