"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This gives you room to negotiate and potentially get closer to your desired price.
* **It's a round number:** This makes the offer easy to understand and digest.

I'm also including a friendly message to make the negotiation process more amicable and encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm not yet desperate enough to sell to John for $12,000.  I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can close the deal closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This would still allow you to make a great profit on this product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but not at the cost of selling far below my minimum value.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, emphasizing his potential profit.
* **Fairness:** I'm positioning this price as fair for both of us, hoping to build trust and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to pay $9,600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,600 is very close to my desired price.  This is a good deal for me, considering I have already rejected John's offer of $12,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
