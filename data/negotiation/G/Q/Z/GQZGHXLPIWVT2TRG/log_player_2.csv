The price is too high. It's better to counteroffer or buy from John."

I'm starting with a low offer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. We'll see how she responds and adjust accordingly."

Alice is still asking for a higher price than I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to John's price."

I'm increasing my offer to $1,300,000.  This is a compromise, but it's still less than John's price.  I'm hoping Alice will see this as a good deal and accept."

While Alice is getting closer to my maximum price,  I'm still not comfortable with $1,700,000. I'll counteroffer one last time before I go with John."

I'm offering $1,450,000. This is a significant jump from my last offer, but still below John's price. If Alice rejects this, I'll go with John."

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. While I'm close to her price, I'd rather just get the product from John at $1,500,000 and avoid further negotiation."
