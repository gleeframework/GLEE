"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique product to you. After careful consideration, we believe it would be valuable to you at a price of $1,200,000. We hope this aligns with your expectations and look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's best to try to negotiate a lower price.  Bob should reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a significant counteroffer, going below Alice's minimum of $1,000,000 but staying within his budget. This shows he's serious about buying the product but wants a fair deal. By offering a specific price, he's making it clear he wants to negotiate constructively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, we propose a price of $1,100,000. We believe this offers a fair compromise for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, but still slightly above what he's comfortable with.  It's worth continuing to negotiate.  Bob should reject the offer and make another counteroffer, potentially aiming for something closer to his initial offer of $1,050,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again trying to find a middle ground.  He's offering a price closer to Alice's last offer, showing that he's serious about a deal.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. We've considered your suggestion and are willing to accept $1,085,000 for the product. We believe this price reflects its value while allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,085,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,075,000. It's also well within Bob's budget of $1,500,000, and significantly lower than what he would pay John. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a favorable price and avoid further negotiation."
