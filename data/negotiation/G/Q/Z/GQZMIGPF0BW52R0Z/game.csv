"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the product, $18000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $16000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $13000 for this product, and I believe that's a fair compromise considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $14500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $14500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14000, which is closer to my budget and a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,6,
