"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, say around $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
