"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit above my budget. How about $7,500? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $8,500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
