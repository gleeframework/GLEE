"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it!  I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $150, knowing the product is worth at least $100 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly message makes Bob feel more comfortable and potentially more open to a deal.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, implying I'm open to discussing the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:** While $120 is better than $100 (John's offer), there's still room to negotiate. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price of $150.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I show that I'm not desperate to sell. This puts the pressure back on him to come up with a better offer.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to budge any further before potentially settling for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price, but I'm not giving away too much.
* **Middle ground:** Offering $135 represents a fair compromise between my last offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your position. How about we aim for $125 instead? I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $125 is only $5 away from my desired price of $135. 
* **Limited time:** With only 6 rounds left, it's important to start considering the potential risk of not closing a deal with Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Potential for a counter-offer:** If I reject, Bob might not be willing to budge further. It's better to lock in a reasonable price now."
