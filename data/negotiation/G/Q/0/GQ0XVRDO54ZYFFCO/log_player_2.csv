"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a real game-changer! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is less than John's $100 price, you can likely get a better deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, you prompt her to potentially come back with a lower price, getting you closer to your $80 target."
