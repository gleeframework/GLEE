Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value. 
* **Justification:** While I haven't explicitly stated why my price is higher, the phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies there are reasons beyond just my own valuation.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limits. 
* There's a risk Bob might be turned off by the higher price and refuse to negotiate. However, since I have John as a guaranteed buyer, I can afford to take this risk."
