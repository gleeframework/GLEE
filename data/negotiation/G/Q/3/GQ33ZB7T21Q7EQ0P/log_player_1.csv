{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer gives Bob a significant discount from his estimated value, making it attractive to him. At the same time, it leaves me with a substantial profit, far exceeding my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a significant profit, I'm confident that I can do better. Bob clearly values the product and is willing to negotiate. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion, so I'm offering $1,025,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,025,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle yet.  Bob clearly still sees value in the product, and I think I can get closer to my target price. I'll counter with a price closer to $1,100,000 in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to achieve my target. I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to push for a higher price, Bob has clearly stated his budget limitations. Accepting his offer of $1,050,000 secures a significant profit for me, exceeding my minimum threshold.  Further negotiation could risk losing the deal altogether. It's time to close the transaction."
