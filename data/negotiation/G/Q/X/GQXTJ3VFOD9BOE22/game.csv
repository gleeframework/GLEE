"Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this happen!",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Could we work something out closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us and gives us a good starting point for further negotiations. Let's find common ground and make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This seems like a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
