"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $105? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",105.0,Alice,5,
