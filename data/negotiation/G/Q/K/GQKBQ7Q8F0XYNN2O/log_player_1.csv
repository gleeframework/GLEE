Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate down if needed. It also includes a friendly message that frames the offer as a good opportunity for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than what I consider fair for the product. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a great price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9000. If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is still lower than my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  Bob seems determined to stay at that price and it's likely further negotiation won't be fruitful.  It's best to accept his offer rather than risk losing him and being stuck with a lower offer from another buyer."
