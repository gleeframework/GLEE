"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
