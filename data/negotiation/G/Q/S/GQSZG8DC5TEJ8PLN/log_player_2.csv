"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially when you have an alternative seller.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially get a better price. You have no information about the value of the product to Alice, so there's a good chance she might be willing to go lower."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $1000000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1250000.  This reflects both its potential for your business and my need to ensure a fair return on this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,250,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your desired price point.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative at $1,500,000, continuing to negotiate could potentially save you more money. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since she already lowered the price once."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
