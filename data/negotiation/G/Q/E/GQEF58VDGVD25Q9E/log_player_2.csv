"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point.  It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above Alice's minimum.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get the price even lower.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue haggling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $11,000. This is still lower than Alice's offer of $11,500, but it shows Bob is willing to compromise. This strategy aims to push the negotiation closer to a deal while still keeping the price below Bob's maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than his maximum price of $15,000 and it's only slightly higher than his last counteroffer.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will get frustrated and refuse to negotiate further. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, and avoids any potential complications with further negotiations."
