Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $18,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the potential benefits of the product for Bob. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm opening the door for negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion. This allows me to gauge his interest and potential counteroffers.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize Potential Earnings:** By starting high, I give myself the best chance of earning a high price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** This allows me to adjust the price based on Bob's interest and counteroffers. 
* **Keep John in Mind:** If Bob is unwilling to pay close to my asking price, I can always accept John's offer of $12,000 to ensure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product, considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still below my desired price point. I'm rejecting his offer because I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial asking price, aiming to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This product is truly special, and I believe it's worth the investment.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $16,000, which is halfway between my initial price of $18,000 and Bob's offer of $14,000. This shows flexibility while still protecting my minimum value.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and framing the counteroffer as a way to meet in the middle. This keeps the negotiation positive and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Common Ground:** This counteroffer is designed to find a middle ground and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** While $16,000 is closer to my preferred price, I'm still willing to negotiate further if necessary.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to consider whether his potential next offer is closer to my minimum value or if I should accept John's $12,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still a bit more than I can justify. I'm willing to go up to $15000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move on to other options. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 is now very close to my minimum value of $12,000.  While I'd ideally like to earn more, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and ensures I get a decent profit. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum Value:** $15,000 is only $3,000 less than my initial asking price and significantly more than John's offer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Bob's message indicates he's at his limit, and further negotiations might lead to him walking away. 
* **Securing Profit:**  Accepting the offer allows me to earn a good profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
