"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $14000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $14000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above that threshold. I'm willing to meet you at $16500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $16500 is still too high. I'm willing to make one final offer of $13500. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to make one last offer to you: I'll sell the product to you for $17000. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options, including selling it to someone else.",17000.0,Alice,7,
