Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a raw deal. 
* **Polite and professional:** The message is friendly and business-like, aiming to establish a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer based on his offer and how much I'm willing to concede.
* If the negotiation drags on or if Bob's offers become too low, I can always switch to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems interesting, but your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,100,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob's rejection and counteroffer show that he's interested in the product. This means there's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean settling for a significantly lower price than I'd like. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,400,000 while acknowledging his initial offer. I'll need to decide how much I'm willing to concede, considering his willingness to pay and my desire to maximize profit.
* If the negotiation continues to stall or if Bob's offers become too low, I'll switch to John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,100,000 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,250,000. This price still allows for a reasonable profit for me while acknowledging your initial offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:** I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise without significantly lowering my profit.
* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I've acknowledged Bob's offer and expressed my willingness to negotiate. This keeps the conversation positive and shows that I'm taking his perspective into account.
* **Emphasize remaining profit:**  I've mentioned a ""reasonable profit"" to subtly remind Bob that I'm still aiming for a price that benefits me.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide how much more I'm willing to concede. I'll also factor in how much time I'm willing to spend negotiating before switching to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  While I could try to counteroffer again, there's a good chance Bob will either reject it or only budge a small amount.  
* **Time and effort:**  Further negotiation might drag on, and I might not be able to secure a much higher price. It's better to accept this offer and move on.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale.
* I'll move on to other business opportunities, knowing I've secured a decent profit."
