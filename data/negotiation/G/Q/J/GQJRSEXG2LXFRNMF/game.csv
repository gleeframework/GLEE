"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a respectable offer, the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
