**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice.  Bob has a chance to negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and further negotiation."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your confidence in the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, while giving you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $850,000 is a respectable offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return.  Would you consider $900,000?  I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer again allows for further negotiation. There is still room for Bob to potentially get a better deal without resorting to buying from John."

Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
