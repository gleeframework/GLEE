"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your confidence in the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, while giving you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $850,000 is a respectable offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return.  Would you consider $900,000?  I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good return, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000. This shows my commitment to acquiring the product, while still keeping the price within a reasonable range.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
