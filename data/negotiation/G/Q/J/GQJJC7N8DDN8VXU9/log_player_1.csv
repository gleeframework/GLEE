Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **Maximizing profit:**  You're aiming for a price higher than your minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Minimizing risk:**  The offer is below Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000, making it likely he'll accept. If he rejects, you still have John as a backup buyer. 

This strategy gives you the best chance of selling the product at a price you're happy with while still considering the potential for a successful negotiation."
