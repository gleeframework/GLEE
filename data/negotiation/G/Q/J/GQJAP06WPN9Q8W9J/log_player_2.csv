"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that. Let me know if you're interested! If not, I'll be selling it to John for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is bluffing. She knows the product is worth more to you ($12,000) than it is to her ($8,000). Her statement about selling to John for $8,000 is a tactic to pressure you.
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay an inflated price. She is likely to come back with a lower offer closer to her actual valuation. 
* Even if she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $12,000, which is your maximum price."
