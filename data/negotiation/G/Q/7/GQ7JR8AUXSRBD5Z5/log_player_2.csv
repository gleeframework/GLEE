"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still above the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the initial offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price slightly above Alice's valuation of the product. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It signals that Bob is serious about buying but is also looking for a good deal.  The lower price also keeps Bob closer to his goal of saving as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price from the first round. While $11,500 is still within Bob's budget, it's getting closer to the price he would pay John. It's worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if he can get a lower price from Alice. There's still some room to potentially get a better deal than $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is raising his offer slightly from the previous round. It's a compromise between his initial offer and Alice's last offer, and it demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate. It also keeps Bob within his budget and is closer to his goal of saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $600 higher than Bob's previous counteroffer, and only $400 lower than the price John would offer.  At this point, the time to make a deal is now. Continuing to negotiate may push the price even higher. It's time to accept the offer and secure the product within Bob's budget."
