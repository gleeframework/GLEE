Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a special price of $11,500. I believe it would be a valuable addition to your inventory."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing that you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, getting you closer to your maximum. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price of $11,500 appears more appealing than a rounded number like $12,000. It might make Bob perceive it as a better deal.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject this offer. However, since we have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, it's a calculated risk to try and get a higher price first."
