"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **I want to maximize my profit.**  I have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net.**  If negotiations with Bob completely fail, I can still sell for a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great price considering the value you get. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. I'm definitely interested, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.**  While it's getting closer, I want to try to get a better deal.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John is a good fallback option, but I'd prefer to make a higher profit.**  I believe there's still a good chance of getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  How about $8,250? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
