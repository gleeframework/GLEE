"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a great price for you, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,000 is still below what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable.  What do you say?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, finding a fair compromise is key here. How about we settle at $11,250?  That's a bit closer to my budget.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $11,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product. ",11500.0,Alice,7,
