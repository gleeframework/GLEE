"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for something worth a lot to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. I'm also adding a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as I have 8 rounds left. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a great price for you, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm proposing a price that's still above my minimum value, but it's a compromise to show I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm also reiterating the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I have 6 rounds left, so I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,000 is still below what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're right, finding a fair compromise is key here. How about we settle at $11,250?  That's a bit closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,250 is tempting, I'm still closer to my desired price. I have 4 rounds left, so I'll continue to negotiate with Bob. I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $11,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product. "", ""product_price"": 11500}
