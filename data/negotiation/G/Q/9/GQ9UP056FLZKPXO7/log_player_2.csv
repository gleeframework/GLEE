Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $11,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and waiting any longer might make her less willing to negotiate. Accepting at $11,500 secures a significant savings compared to both her initial offer and John's price."
