"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $65 for it. What do you think?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $65 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $90? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  However, $75 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $85 is still a bit higher than I was hoping for. I can do $78, and I promise that's my final offer. What do you say?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. Given your commitment to buying, I'm willing to go down to $82. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",82.0,Alice,7,
