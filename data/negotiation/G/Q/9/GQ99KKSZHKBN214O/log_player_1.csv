Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see if I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's a good compromise and I'm happy to secure the sale. There's always a chance I could continue negotiating, but I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
