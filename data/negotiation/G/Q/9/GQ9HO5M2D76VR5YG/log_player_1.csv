Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can still reach an agreement. Would you consider selling the product for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $110 is a solid profit above my minimum. It's always better to secure a good deal than risk losing it entirely."
