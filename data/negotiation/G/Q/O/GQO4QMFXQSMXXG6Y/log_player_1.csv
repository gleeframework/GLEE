Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you place on this product,  $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm interested in the product and would like to offer $650000.  This reflects the value I'm willing to pay, considering my budget and the potential for negotiation.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

I'm confident that we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to be flexible.
