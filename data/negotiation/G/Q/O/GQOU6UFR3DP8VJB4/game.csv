"Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this incredible product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your initial thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting the product. While I agree it has value, your starting price is quite high. I'd be willing to start negotiations at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you considering my initial offer. However, your counter-offer is quite a bit lower than what I have in mind. This product offers significant value, and I need to ensure that's reflected in the final price.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I propose $2,100,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the true value of this product.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm serious about purchasing it. However,  $2,100,000 is still far from where I'd be comfortable.  To show I'm willing to move towards a deal, I'll counter with $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It's clear we both see value in this product. While I'm encouraged by your latest offer, the gap between our positions is still significant. To bridge this, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a substantial move on my end and reflects my commitment to reaching a fair agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the adjustment. Your offer shows movement, and I appreciate that.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and recognize we're both invested in finding common ground. However, your current offer doesn't reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,700,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end. I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. Your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. To meet you closer to the middle, I'll offer $1,250,000. This is a significant jump on my end and demonstrates my desire to close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
