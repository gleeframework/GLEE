"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's target price of $12,000.  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm still looking to get a bit lower.  How about $13,000?  This is within my budget, and it would make this a really good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $13,800? This is a great compromise that still gives you a good discount while allowing me to make a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,800 is still a good deal for Bob. It's below his budget of $15,000 and closer to his target price of $12,000. While he could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his next offer or simply decide to sell to someone else.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without taking on the risk of further negotiation."
