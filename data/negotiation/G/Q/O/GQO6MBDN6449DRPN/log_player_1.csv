"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and I believe my initial offer is reflective of its potential.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value this product brings."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,650,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,500,000.  This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,500,000 is a significant profit. It's a strong return and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
