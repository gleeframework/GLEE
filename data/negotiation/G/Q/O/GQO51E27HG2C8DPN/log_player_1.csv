Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product. This gives me some room to negotiate, while still being a potentially attractive offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get at least my minimum value. I will counter-offer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
I'm counter-offering at $10,500. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm not confident I can get Bob to agree to my desired price. John's offer of $10,000 is exactly my minimum value, so it's a guaranteed outcome that ensures I meet my goals."
