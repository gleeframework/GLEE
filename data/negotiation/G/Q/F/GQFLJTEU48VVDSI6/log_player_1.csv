Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a higher price ($18,000) leaves room for negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price higher than your fallback option. 
* **Creating Value Perception:** The message subtly implies high demand and a potential price increase in the future (""before I list it publicly""). This could nudge Bob towards accepting the offer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with a small risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to absolutely guarantee the $15,000 sale, offering it to Bob at that price would be the safest approach."
