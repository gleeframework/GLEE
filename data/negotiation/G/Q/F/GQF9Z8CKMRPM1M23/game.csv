"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $750000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700000. I understand the value of the product, but I'm working with a tight budget.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiations. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $725000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get it for $710000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and for you to secure a sale. Let's see if we can make this happen.",710000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $720000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",720000.0,Alice,5,
