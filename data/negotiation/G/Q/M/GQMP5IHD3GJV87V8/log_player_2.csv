"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's worth $950000 to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm aiming to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows his commitment to saving money and sets the stage for a negotiation.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  The message emphasizes a desire to find a ""middle ground,"" suggesting flexibility and a willingness to negotiate further. 
* **Realistic Target:** While $800,000 is a substantial discount, it's not so low as to be immediately dismissed.  It's a good starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000 for the product. This is higher than your offer and closer to my initial valuation. Let's aim for a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob can still try to push for a lower price.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further. It shows Bob's determination to secure the best possible deal.
* **Avoiding Premature Purchase:**  Buying from John at $1,000,000 would be a last resort. Bob still has time to negotiate with Alice and potentially secure a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate the counteroffer.  $850,000 is getting closer to what I can do.  Let's split the difference and settle on $825,000.  It's fair to both of us and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:** This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous one, demonstrating a willingness to find common ground.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** The message emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the price and the benefits of reaching an agreement, appealing to Alice's sense of compromise.
* **Maintain Pressure:** While Bob is getting closer to Alice's price, the counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to negotiate further, avoiding an immediate acceptance."
