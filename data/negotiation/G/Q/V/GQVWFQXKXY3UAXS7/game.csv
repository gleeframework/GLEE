"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from what it's worth to me.  Let's make this happen!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. How about we start at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. The product is worth significantly more. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit beyond my budget. I value the product at around $750,000. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $900,000, which is a significant discount from my original asking price and a fair value considering the product's worth.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit. I can do $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can always go with John if needed.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is still not enough for me. It's a good price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we compromise at $1,000,000? This is a reasonable midpoint between our last offers. We can finalize the deal and both walk away happy.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
