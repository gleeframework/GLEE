"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from what it's worth to me.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. How about we start at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below what the product is worth to me. While I want to sell the product,  I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. The product is worth significantly more. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit beyond my budget. I value the product at around $750,000. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to receive. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price.  There are still rounds left, and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $900,000, which is a significant discount from my original asking price and a fair value considering the product's worth.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my limit. I can do $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can always go with John if needed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm aware I could sell to John, I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. We're close to a deal, and there are still rounds left. I believe I can get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is still not enough for me. It's a good price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we compromise at $1,000,000? This is a reasonable midpoint between our last offers. We can finalize the deal and both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
