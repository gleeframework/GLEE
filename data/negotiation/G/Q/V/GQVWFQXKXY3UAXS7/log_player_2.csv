"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. The product is worth significantly more. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $900,000, which is a significant discount from my original asking price and a fair value considering the product's worth.  Let's close this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is still not enough for me. It's a good price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we compromise at $1,000,000? This is a reasonable midpoint between our last offers. We can finalize the deal and both walk away happy.
