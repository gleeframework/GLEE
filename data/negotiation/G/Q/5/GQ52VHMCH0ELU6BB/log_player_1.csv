Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a price significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures you don't settle for less than your guaranteed amount.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" the message subtly justifies the high price without revealing your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to purchase the product."
