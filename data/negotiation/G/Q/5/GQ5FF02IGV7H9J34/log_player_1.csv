"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $1,000,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge above his valuation of $1,000,000. It's unlikely further negotiation will close the gap to a price acceptable for me. Accepting John's offer ensures I get the product's minimum value."
