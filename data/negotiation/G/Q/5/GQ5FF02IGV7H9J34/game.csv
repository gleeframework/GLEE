"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $1,000,000? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
