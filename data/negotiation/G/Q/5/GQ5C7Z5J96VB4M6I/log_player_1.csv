"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product name] that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the [product name]. I appreciate your item, but I was hoping to pay less than $150. Would you consider $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than $100 (John's offer), it's still below my minimum price of $100. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $120 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about $135? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the [product name] at that price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my budget. Would $125 be within your consideration? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $125 is now above my minimum threshold of $100. I'm also nearing the middle of the negotiation process, and it's likely that further counter-offers might lead to a stalemate.  It's best to accept the offer and secure the sale."
