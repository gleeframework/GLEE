"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to get a deal done.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you, and it's a fair compromise for me. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that would allow us both to close the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
