"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1200000 is a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1350000.  This price still reflects the exceptional value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $1150000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to drop my price a bit further to $1250000.
