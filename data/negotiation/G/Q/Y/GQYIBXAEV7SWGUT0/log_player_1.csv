Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This product is truly top-notch and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000. I think that's a fair offer considering my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is not moving significantly towards a price that is acceptable. It's unlikely he will reach a price close to $10,000 in the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best possible outcome at this point."
