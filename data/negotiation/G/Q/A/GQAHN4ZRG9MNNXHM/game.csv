"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm still very interested in purchasing it, but I need to stay within my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,300,000 represents the high end of its value,  $1,800,000 undervalues what this product brings to the table. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I believe this price point reflects both the product's worth and your budget considerations.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget, but I'm still willing to pay a premium for this product. Can we discuss this further?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,600,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise. What do you say?",1850000.0,Alice,5,
