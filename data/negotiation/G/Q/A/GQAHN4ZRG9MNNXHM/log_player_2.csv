Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,300,000 represents the high end of its value,  $1,800,000 undervalues what this product brings to the table. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I believe this price point reflects both the product's worth and your budget considerations.
