"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm asking for $13,750. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $12,750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12750.0,Bob,4,
