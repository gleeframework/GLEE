Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $80 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $160 to make this work.  It's a fantastic product, and I believe you'll find it well worth that price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  Let's split the difference - $127.50.  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's clear she's aiming for a price well above your $100 limit.  It's unlikely she'll reach a price you find acceptable within the remaining rounds. Cutting your losses and going with John guarantees you get the product within your budget."
