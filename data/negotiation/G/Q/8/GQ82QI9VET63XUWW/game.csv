"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to the product's real value.  Would you consider $1,025,000? This is my final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
