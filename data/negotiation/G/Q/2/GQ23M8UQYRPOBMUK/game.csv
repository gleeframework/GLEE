"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price, given the potential value and my own resources.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product has the potential to generate significant returns, and I need to ensure a fair deal for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair reflection of the product's potential. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
