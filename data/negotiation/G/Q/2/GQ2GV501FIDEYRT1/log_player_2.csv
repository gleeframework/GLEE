# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I am proposing a revised price of $1,100,000 for the product. This offer reflects a balance between the value of the product and your budget constraints.

**Explanation:**

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. He can likely get it for less, given that Alice is motivated to sell.  By rejecting, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to push the price down further."
