Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

While $110 is a better offer than Alice's original price, it's still over my budget. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot by meeting you halfway and then coming down to $110. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make at least a minimum profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $100 is a better price than Alice's initial offers, it's still over my budget. Since I can get the product from John for $80, I'll take that option.  It's more in line with my price limit, and I don't want to continue haggling."
