"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,000? That still gives you a good price, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more careful with my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $9,500 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but I need to be honest. $9,800 just isn't enough for me to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 as a final compromise. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do. If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to explore other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm really interested in this product, but I've been given another opportunity to buy it from someone else. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I need to make a decision soon. Please let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Bob,8,
