"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $115 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 isn't quite enough for me.  Let's try $105.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my asking price.",105.0,Alice,5,
