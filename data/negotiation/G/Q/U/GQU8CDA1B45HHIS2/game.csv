"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and features, I'm initially offering it at $22,000.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you won't regret this investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I could potentially stretch my budget to $11,000. Would that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, I can't go as low as $11,000. To be candid, I have another potential buyer.  However, I value our conversation, so I'm willing to make one more significant move.  My final offer is $15,000. This is a considerable discount and reflects my desire to close the deal with you.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand you have other potential buyers and I appreciate the discount, but $15,000 is still pushing it for me.  How about we settle at $12,500? This is a fair offer, considering your other potential buyer might not be willing to match it.",12500.0,Bob,6,
