"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product.  Could you consider $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I could potentially do $950,000. That's a significant move on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $950,000 is still below my ideal price point, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a substantial reduction, and I hope it reflects my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,000,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  If not, I'll need to consider my other option.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
