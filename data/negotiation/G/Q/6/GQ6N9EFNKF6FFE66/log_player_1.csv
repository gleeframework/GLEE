Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Reasoning:

Bob has revealed his top price is $1,000,000 and he has another offer at that price.  Continuing to negotiate with him is unlikely to yield a better outcome. Accepting his offer would leave me with a $200,000 loss compared to John's offer. Selling to John ensures I receive the full value I require."
