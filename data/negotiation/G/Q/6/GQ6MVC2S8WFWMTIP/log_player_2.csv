"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you! Would you like to purchase it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $120 is within your budget, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one. It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal before settling."
