"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings, but I'm open to negotiating further.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings is significant. I could come down to $17,000. This is a more reasonable offer, reflecting the product's true worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,
