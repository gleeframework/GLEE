Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, knowing my minimum is $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Open to negotiation:**  By saying I'm open to negotiation, I'm signaling flexibility and encouraging Bob to counteroffer. This keeps the conversation going. 
* **Expressing value:**  Highlighting the product's ""fantastic"" nature can subtly influence Bob's perception of its worth. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first step in a negotiation. The key is to gauge Bob's interest, be prepared to counter his offers, and know when to walk away and sell to John if the deal doesn't meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum, but I still have room to push for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to try and get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  $9,500 is a good middle ground between Bob's offer and my desired price. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but haven't completely conceded.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encouraging. This helps maintain a good rapport and avoids unnecessary tension.
* **Reiterate value:**  While I'm focusing on price, a subtle reminder of ""making this work"" hints at the product's worth and keeps the focus on finding a solution. 

**Important Note:** My decision to counter depends on my assessment of Bob's interest and the potential for him to walk away. If he seems truly interested, I can push for a higher price. If I think he's close to walking away, I'll be more likely to accept his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $9200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to my minimum of $8,000. While I would prefer more, it's unlikely I can get a better price. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  Therefore, accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
