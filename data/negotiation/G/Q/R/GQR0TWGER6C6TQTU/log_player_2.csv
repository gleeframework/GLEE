"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,000,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price of $850,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $1,000,000 but still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. This initial counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially find a price point that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his ideal value.  It's a risk, as Alice could walk away, but the potential for further savings is worth the gamble."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer to $900,000,  which is still lower than Alice's current offer of $950,000 but getting closer to a potential deal.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the offer again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's latest offer of $980,000 is getting too close to Bob's maximum budget and is likely to lead to a prolonged negotiation with no guarantee of a successful outcome.  At this point, Bob is better off securing the product from John for $800,000. This guarantees a deal within his budget and avoids further haggling with Alice."
