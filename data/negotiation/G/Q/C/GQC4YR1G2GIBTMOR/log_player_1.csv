Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.  I'm confident we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $875,000. This price is fair and allows for both of us to gain something from this transaction. I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.
