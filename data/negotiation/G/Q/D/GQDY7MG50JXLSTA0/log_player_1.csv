Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. This allows for potential negotiation, while ensuring I get at least what the product is worth to me.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and potentially negotiate further. However, I'm always prepared to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to sell the product, I'm not willing to go below $120. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows my willingness to negotiate, but also sets a limit on how low I'm willing to go."
