{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit lower than my minimum price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than selling to John.  I'll be ready to counter if Bob rejects it, but I also have the option to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000 and even my initial offer of $12,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. This is my final offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,750 is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.  While it is closer to what I'm willing to accept, it's still not enough to make the sale worthwhile.  I'm confident that I can get a better price from John, so I'll choose to sell to him."
