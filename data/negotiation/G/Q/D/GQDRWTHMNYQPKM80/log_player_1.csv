Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, that's a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd only be able to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.

**Explanation:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
