"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering my budget.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value it brings to your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $7,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my strong interest in closing this deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad to see that you're serious about purchasing the product, Bob. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the value this product brings. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",10500.0,Alice,5,
