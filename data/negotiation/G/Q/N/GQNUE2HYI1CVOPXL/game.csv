"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $6,000 to you. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the benefits it will bring to your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I could go up to $7,000, but that's my limit.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $7,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
