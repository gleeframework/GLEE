"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see that you're serious about acquiring the product.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1050000. This price is a good compromise that allows both of us to get a fair deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's the highest I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to make a good return on your investment.  Let's make this deal happen!",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go up to $975000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",975000.0,Bob,6,
