# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about $760,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 760000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $760,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is the best possible outcome. Alice is unlikely to go any lower than her own product valuation. Accepting this offer secures the product at the best possible price."
