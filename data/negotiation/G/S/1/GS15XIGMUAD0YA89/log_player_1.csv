```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $950,000.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully will be enough to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's lower than what I initially hoped for, it's still significantly higher than what I would get from John.  It's important to secure the sale, and I'm confident this is a good deal."
