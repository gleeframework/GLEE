"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to save as much money as possible. I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that might be acceptable to her.  This gives us both some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that the price might seem a bit high, Bob, but I assure you this product is worth every penny. How about we meet in the middle at $120?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is getting closer to my desired price, I still think I can get it lower.  I'm not willing to buy from John yet as $120 is still a better deal. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $115? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. It's still lower than Alice's offer, but it shows I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for Alice to accept, as she's likely losing money selling it to John for $150."
