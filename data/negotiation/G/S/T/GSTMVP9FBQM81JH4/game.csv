"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  Given the value you place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you've placed on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you placed on the product and allows me to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $1,025,000 is the lowest I can go. This is a price that I think is still reasonable, considering the value you place on the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,025,000 is still slightly higher than I'd like to go. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement if we meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This price is a fair compromise that takes into account both our desired outcomes.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product.",985000.0,Alice,7,
