Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit. I'm also reminding Bob of the value he places on the product, hoping to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? I think that's fair for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
