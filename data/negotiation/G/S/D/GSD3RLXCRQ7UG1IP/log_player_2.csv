"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it for $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still above the product's value to Alice.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? I think that's fair for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both parties, considering the product's value to Alice and Bob's target price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product at a significant discount compared to John's price, while still ensuring a reasonable profit for Alice."
