Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** I need to make at least $1,000,000 to be happy with the sale. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering $1,500,000 gives me a significant profit, but it also risks Bob rejecting the offer.  
* **Potential Upside:** If Bob values the product at more than $1,500,000, I've maximized my profit. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing John will pay $1,000,000 gives me some confidence to go for a higher price. 

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming to maximize my profit while still having a fallback option if Bob doesn't accept."
