"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $110?  It's a fair price for a product that you value at $100 and will give you a good deal. Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but  $102 just isn't enough for me.  Let's compromise - I'll come down to $108. This is my final offer, and it's still a great price for a product you value at $100. What do you say?",108.0,Alice,5,
