Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me, and still a good price for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly below what the product is worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting the potential savings for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question, inviting Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially counter-offer. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I'm maximizing my chances of securing a price closer to my target of $10,000. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still accept his counteroffer if it's close enough to my minimum price. If it's not, I can always fall back on selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum price of $10,000 and even lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($8,000).  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial financial loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  Although Bob's initial offer is low, he is willing to negotiate. This means there's still room for us to reach a mutually acceptable price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range. This will allow me to explore if we can find common ground. If we can't, I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($9,500) and his offer ($8,500). 
* **Mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise, emphasizing the benefits for both of us.
* **Open to negotiation:**  Again, I'm ending with a question, encouraging Bob to respond and potentially continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. This increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement without resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to save some money, Alice. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has slightly increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $10,000.
* **Time is money:**  Continued negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price closer to my desired range. It's becoming clear that our bargaining positions are too far apart.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $10,000, which is my minimum requirement. 

**Strategy:**

Rather than continue a potentially fruitless negotiation with Bob, I'm choosing to accept the guaranteed profit by selling to John.  This decision prioritizes my financial goals and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to an even lower price."
