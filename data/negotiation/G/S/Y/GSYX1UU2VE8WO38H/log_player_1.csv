Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at my minimum acceptable price. Bob knows the product is worth less to him, so he'll likely counteroffer. This will give us room to negotiate. I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close, but I'm not willing to settle for $500 less than my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750} 
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still ensuring a profit. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, we'll continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I'm willing to take a slight loss on the deal, but I'm not going to settle for $750 less than my minimum.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit."
