"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $120, there's room to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  I'm interested but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. A counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable starting point. It's still a good profit for Alice (since she values it at $100), but it's a significant reduction from her initial offer and puts the price closer to Bob's preferred range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's price point, but $115 is still higher than Bob's desired range.  Since there are more rounds left, Bob can continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $110? That's a good middle ground, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to keep the price below his maximum of $120. By offering $110, he's showing Alice that he's serious about purchasing the product while still trying to get a good deal. This price is also a compromise from his previous offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $110. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give it away. I'll offer it to you for $112. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $112, which is within Bob's budget and only slightly higher than his previous counteroffer.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there are only 5 rounds remaining.  Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product and avoids the risk of Alice becoming less willing to negotiate or the deal falling through entirely. It's also a better deal than buying from John for $120."
