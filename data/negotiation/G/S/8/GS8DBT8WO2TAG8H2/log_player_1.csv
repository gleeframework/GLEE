Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum price of $100, but it also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer.  I'm confident he'll accept since the product is worth $120 to him, and he'll still be getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price yet. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I think it's a fair price that we can both agree on. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
