"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. However, my budget is limited to $8,000 for this purchase. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,500 to make this work.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's still lower than what I'd get from another buyer. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I would prefer to stay within my budget of $8,000, I am willing to consider your offer of $9,500. However, I believe we might be able to find common ground. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle, closer to my budget? Perhaps $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
