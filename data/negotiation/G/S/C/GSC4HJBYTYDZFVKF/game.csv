"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While I agree the product is good, $17,000 is still a bit much for my budget.  Could we possibly settle around $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be upfront - I can't let this go for anything less than $14,500.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,5,
