Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message focuses on the product's benefits and Bob's needs, creating a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"" I signal that I'm open to discussing the price and potentially reaching a compromise.

While this initial offer is high, it's a strategic first step in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below both my minimum price ($15,000) and his own perceived value ($12,000). This suggests he has room to move, and accepting this offer would leave a significant amount of money on the table. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Hold Firm:** I'm signaling willingness to negotiate by moving significantly from my initial price. However, I'm still aiming above my minimum of $15,000.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and potentially move Bob closer to his perceived value. 
* **""Meet in the Middle"":** This framing suggests fairness and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While I agree the product is good, $17,000 is still a bit much for my budget.  Could we possibly settle around $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a substantial loss. I'll make one more counteroffer close to my minimum, but if Bob doesn't meet me near that point, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be upfront - I can't let this go for anything less than $14,500.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my last offer, creating a sense of urgency and signaling I'm firm on my price.
* **Justification:** I'm briefly reiterating the product's value while justifying the price.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm dropping my price slightly below my $15,000 minimum as a final gesture of goodwill. This leaves a small margin for negotiation if Bob is truly interested.
* **Ready to Walk Away:** I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects this offer. Holding firm at this point demonstrates my value for the product and ensures I don't settle for a deal that's significantly below what I'm willing to accept."
