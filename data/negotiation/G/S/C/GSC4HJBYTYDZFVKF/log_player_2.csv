You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be upfront - I can't let this go for anything less than $14,500.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, her ""final offer"" of $14,500 is still significantly higher than John's $12,000 price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and further negotiation might not be worth the potential savings.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
