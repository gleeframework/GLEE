Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message highlights the value proposition for Bob, making it clear this is a good deal even if he tries to haggle a bit.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the fallback option of selling to John."
