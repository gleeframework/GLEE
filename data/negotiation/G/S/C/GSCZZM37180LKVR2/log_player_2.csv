"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $17,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.  There's a chance you might be able to secure a price closer to your target, or at least get a better understanding of her flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $10,000. This sets a clear boundary and shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal.  It's likely she'll reject this offer, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is closer to my maximum budget, it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  There's still room for negotiation.  I'll try to counteroffer again to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $12,000. This is a reasonable compromise between my initial offer of $10,000 and Alice's latest offer of $14,000. It demonstrates that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but still trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still willing to negotiate further. There are still 5 rounds left, and I believe I can push for a slightly lower price.  I'll counteroffer one more time to see if I can get Alice to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $12,500. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm still interested in making a deal, but I'm not willing to pay Alice's full asking price.  We're getting close to a potential agreement, and this final counteroffer may be enough to convince Alice to accept."
