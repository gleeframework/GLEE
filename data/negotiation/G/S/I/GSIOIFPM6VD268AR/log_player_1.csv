Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

While I'd like to get closer to my asking price, Bob's offers are starting to feel like we're going in circles. John is a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
