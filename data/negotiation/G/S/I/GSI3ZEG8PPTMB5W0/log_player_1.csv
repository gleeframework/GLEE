"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to go higher. I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we both feel like we're getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it's not significantly higher than his initial valuation of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to $105. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120 and I'm not yet convinced it's worth selling for less. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm dropping my price to $100, showing a continued willingness to compromise.  I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's offers and my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement this round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price and we're running out of time. To avoid risking getting a lower price or running out of rounds completely, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, ensuring I get my minimum desired value."
