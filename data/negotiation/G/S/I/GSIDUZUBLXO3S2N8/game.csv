"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $6,000 is too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,500, but that's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need $10,000 to make this work. It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
