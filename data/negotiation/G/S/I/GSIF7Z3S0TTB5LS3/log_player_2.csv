"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good discount, it's still too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $600,000 is a bold move, but it shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This price is also well within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a better price than the initial offer, Bob can still push for a better deal. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try and secure a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's desired price. Offering $700,000 shows that Bob is serious about buying the product, but still wants a good deal. It's a reasonable middle ground that could potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is only $25,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer. This is a good price for Bob, considering he's already saved $275,000 from the initial offer.  Accepting the offer ensures a deal and prevents further negotiations that might lead to a stalemate or a situation where Bob has to buy from John at a higher price."
