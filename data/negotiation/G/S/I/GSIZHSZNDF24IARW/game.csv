"Bob, I have a truly unique product I believe you'd find highly valuable. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay up to $1000000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This represents a significant compromise on my side, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. $1250000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still hoping to get it for $1100000.  This is a fair compromise, as it's halfway between your last offer and my previous one. Let's see if we can make it work.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
