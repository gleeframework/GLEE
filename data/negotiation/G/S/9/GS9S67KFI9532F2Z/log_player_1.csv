Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my desired price.  $160 is still a bit low, but I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down to $165.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 165}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice! However, $165 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $155? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $155 is a good compromise. It's within a reasonable range of my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by being too stubborn."
