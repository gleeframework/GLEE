Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $7,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $8,100. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'll offer $7,500. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

Bob is firmly rooted at $7,500 and unwilling to budge. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and risking more rounds jeopardizes securing a sale at your minimum acceptable price. Accepting John's offer guarantees you meet your baseline and avoids a potential loss from further haggling."
