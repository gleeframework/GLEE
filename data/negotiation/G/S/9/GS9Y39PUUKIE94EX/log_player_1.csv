Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100:** This is a starting point that is above Bob's value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for me.
* **The message:** This is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It also highlights the potential value of the product for him.

**Reasoning:**

I chose this offer because it allows me to maximize my potential profit while still being reasonable. I want to start the negotiation at a price that is high enough to make it worth my while, but not so high that Bob is immediately turned off. This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob rejects the offer, I can then adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It is also much lower than my initial offer of $100. Accepting this offer would result in a significant financial loss for me. 

**Reasoning:**

While I am open to negotiation, I need to ensure I am not selling the product below my minimum value. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and counter with a price closer to my desired value or to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $85.  Let's find a middle ground here.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$85:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $65. It's still above Bob's value of $80, but it shows that I am willing to negotiate.
* **The message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation. It also emphasizes that I'm willing to compromise, which could make him more likely to accept.

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move to bridge the gap between our desired prices. By offering $85, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum acceptable price. If Bob accepts, I gain a decent profit. If he rejects, I can re-evaluate and potentially move closer to John's offer."
