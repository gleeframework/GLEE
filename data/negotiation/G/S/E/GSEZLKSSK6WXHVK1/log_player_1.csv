Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a decent margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John for the guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$50 is far too low for me. I'm rejecting his offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $100. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob while still leaving some room for negotiation if needed."
