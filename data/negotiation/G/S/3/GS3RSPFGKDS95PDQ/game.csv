"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a unique item with a lot of value, and I believe this price reflects that. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11500?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I still think $11500 is a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $9000 is a bit low for me, I see that you're willing to negotiate. How about we try $10500? That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is the price I was initially offered by John. Can you meet me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,6,
