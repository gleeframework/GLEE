{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique item with a lot of value, and I believe this price reflects that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Setting a high initial price:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards.
* **Providing a reason for the price:**  Highlighting the value of the product can make Bob more willing to consider a higher price.
* **Inviting Bob to engage:**  Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

Keep in mind, this is just the starting point. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and your assessment of his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is a significant amount, it's still below your minimum price of $10,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledges Bob's offer:** Shows you're listening and engaging in the negotiation.
* **Rejects the offer, but keeps the door open:**  Clearly states your position while remaining open to further discussions.
* **Counteroffers with a compromise:**  The price is a midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating your willingness to meet halfway.
* **Provides a rationale:**  Reiterates the value of the product to justify the proposed price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I still think $11500 is a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is getting closer to your minimum price, it's still not enough.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to potentially get a better deal. It's risky to sell to John for $10,000 at this point because Bob is still potentially willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I see that you're willing to negotiate. How about we try $10,500? That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Shows appreciation and acknowledges effort:**  Reinforces the positive aspects of the negotiation.
* **Rejects offer, but keeps it amicable:**  Continues the negotiation while keeping a positive tone.
* **Offers a counter-compromise:**  The price is a midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Highlights the progress:**  Focuses on the fact that the negotiation is getting closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is the price I was initially offered by John. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is your minimum price, and you've been able to negotiate a fair price while still earning your desired amount.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best choice, as you've achieved your goal of earning at least $10,000."
