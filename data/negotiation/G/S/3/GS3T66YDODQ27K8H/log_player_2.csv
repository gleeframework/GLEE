"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, and she's asking for $9,500.  
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This gives you ample time to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  I'm offering a price closer to Alice's minimum value, hoping to incentivize her to accept.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This still leaves some room for Alice to counter-offer, but it shows I'm serious about making a deal. 
* **Early action:**  By making a strong counteroffer early on, I aim to establish my negotiating position and potentially get the price down quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's come down a bit, it's still above my target price of $8,500.
* **I'm confident I can get a better price.**  We've already established some negotiation, and I'm willing to play this out for a few more rounds.
* **I have time.** I'm not desperate to buy, and I have rounds left to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price below Alice's previous offer. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to meet halfway. If she accepts, great! If she rejects, it might prompt her to offer a lower price in the next round.
* **Strategic positioning:** I'm keeping my options open.  This counteroffer doesn't push me too close to my limit, allowing me to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting close to my target price.** Her offer is now only $300 above what I'm willing to pay.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it.** While I could try to get a lower price, the potential savings are small, and I'm already at round 5.  
* **Risk of losing the deal.** Continuing to haggle could risk Alice getting frustrated and refusing to negotiate further.  It's also possible she might receive another offer. 

**At this point, it's more advantageous to accept the offer and secure the product for a price that's close to my desired range.**"
