Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **High Value:** I believe the product holds significant value, and I'm aiming for a price that reflects that. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** By starting high, I leave room for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price.
* **John as Safety Net:** I'm confident I can sell to John for $1,200,000 if Bob rejects my offer, so there's limited downside to a higher initial price.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
