Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this unique product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering your persistence and the value you see in the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.

While I could try to push for a lower price, $1,050,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly less than John's offer and close to Alice's perceived value. Accepting now avoids the risk of Alice retracting the offer and me ending up with a worse deal."
