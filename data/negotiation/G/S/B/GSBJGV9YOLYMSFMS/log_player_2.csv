"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for a steal! I'm willing to let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $100 is better than $120, there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  Offering $90 is a reasonable starting point, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is better than $120, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer closer to your target price of $90, potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit high for my budget.  Let's try $95. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to move closer to Alice's initial offer while remaining within your budget. By offering $95, you're showing a willingness to compromise further while still holding onto a price that's significantly lower than Alice's previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to meet you at $110. I'm confident that's a fair price for this great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than $120, it's still not ideal.  You've already made some concessions and Alice has also come down in price. By rejecting the offer, you can continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to your target of $95.  There are still several rounds left, so there's a good chance of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm still hoping for a lower price. How about $100? I'm happy with the product and confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer makes a significant move towards Alice's offer, showing that you're serious about buying the product and willing to compromise. Offering $100 puts you in the middle ground, making it more likely Alice will accept.  This also keeps the negotiation going without putting you in a position where you'd be better off buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet at $112? I'm willing to make a small compromise to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $112 is closer to your budget, there's still room to negotiate and reach a lower price.  The fact that Alice is willing to make a ""small compromise"" suggests she's open to further negotiation. Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer closer to your target price of $100.  You only have three rounds left, so it's important to push for a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $105? That's right in the middle of our current offers and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to move towards Alice's offer but still remains below her current proposal. By offering $105, you're showing a commitment to finding a compromise and a willingness to meet halfway. You're also acknowledging Alice's concessions and presenting a price that's more appealing than her last offer. With only two rounds left, this counteroffer can potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $105, but I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $115. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Alice's final offer, and while $115 is not your ideal price, it's still a better deal than buying from John for $120. There's only one round left, and it's highly unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price in that single round.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product and saves you $5 compared to buying from John."
