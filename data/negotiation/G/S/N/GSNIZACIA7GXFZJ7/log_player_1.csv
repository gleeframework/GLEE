Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my floor price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired $1,150,000.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price and see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000 for the product. This price still reflects the significant value it offers you, and it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the value I can get from the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my desired price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further price reductions and potential delays is not worth it. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's a safe and secure option that meets my minimum price requirement."
