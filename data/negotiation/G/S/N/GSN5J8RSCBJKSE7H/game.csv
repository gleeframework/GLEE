"Alice, $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8500. Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway at $10500. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $9500?  I'm really eager to get this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $10750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,5,
