"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is a significant drop. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,175,000 is closer to what I'm comfortable with, I still believe we could find common ground. Could we agree on $1,100,000 for the product?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
