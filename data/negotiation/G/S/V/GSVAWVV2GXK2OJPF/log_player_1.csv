Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice should start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than John's guaranteed offer. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering the product at $145, Alice positions it as a potential bargain compared to John's offer of $150.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice still has the option to slightly lower the price to entice him while still making a profit."
