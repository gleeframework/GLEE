"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer in a positive way, highlighting the value of the product for Bob.  I'm also leaving the door open for discussion. 

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation without immediately hitting a wall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept at this stage.  I want to see if I can push him a bit higher.  By rejecting his offer and counter-offering in the next round, I can potentially secure a better price.  

I'm not yet ready to sell to John because I believe there's a possibility of getting a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm open to negotiating. However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've raised the price from Bob's offer of $8,500 to $9,250. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm again framing the offer in a positive way, emphasizing the fair price and value of the product. I'm also keeping the conversation open for further negotiation.

This strategy aims to push Bob towards a higher price while still leaving room for a deal to be struck."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $9,250, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a revised offer of $8,750. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has raised his offer slightly, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to settle for that price, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting his offer and counter-offering again, I can try to get a better price.  

It's getting close to the point where I might need to consider selling to John, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm dropping my price to $9,000, which is closer to Bob's offer and may incentivize him to accept. However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves a slight margin for potential further negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm highlighting my willingness to compromise and emphasizing the fair value of the product. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting that we close the deal. 

This approach aims to push Bob towards accepting a price that is still beneficial to me, while maintaining a positive and collaborative tone.  I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping to secure a higher price before needing to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $8,500. I've done my research and I know this product is worth less than what you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's clear that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  While I'm not thrilled about losing out on the potential for a higher price with Bob, I'm not willing to risk a deal falling through and ending up with nothing.  John is offering a guaranteed $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John."
