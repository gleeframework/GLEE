"I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm open to negotiating. However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $9,250, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a revised offer of $8,750. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal, what do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $8,500. I've done my research and I know this product is worth less than what you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,6,
