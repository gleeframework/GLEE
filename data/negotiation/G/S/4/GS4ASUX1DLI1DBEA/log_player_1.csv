Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you."", ""product_price"": 2250000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and signals the product's high value.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $2,250,000, we set a high anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's likely the final price will be closer to our desired range than if we started lower. 
* **Leaving John as Leverage:** We haven't revealed our fallback option (John).  If negotiations stall, we can mention we have other interested buyers, which might incentivize Bob to be more flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable investment. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches what John is willing to pay, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. There's room for negotiation. We'll counter-offer in the hopes of closing the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the product's value significantly exceeds that.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair deal considering its potential."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** We're dropping the price by $250,000, which demonstrates flexibility but keeps us well above both Bob's offer and our minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:**  We're reminding Bob of the product's potential, aiming to justify the higher price and move him away from solely focusing on his perceived worth.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We haven't revealed our fallback option (John) yet, preserving our ability to use it as leverage later if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,750,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, but not enough:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and his latest offer is moving in the right direction. However, it's still below our $2,000,000 target.
* **Negotiating Room Remains:**  We're not in a desperate situation yet. We haven't revealed our option with John, and Bob seems invested in the negotiation.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, we gauge how much further Bob is willing to go. It's possible he'll significantly increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $1,900,000 for the product. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're signaling that we're nearing the end of our negotiation flexibility with the ""final offer"" statement. This adds weight to the offer.
* **Strategic Concession:** The price drop is smaller this time, demonstrating we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Compromise:**  We're meeting Bob partway while still aiming for a price that's significantly above our guaranteed option with John.

By now, Bob should understand we're serious about the value and that our concessions are getting smaller. This might be enough to get him to agree or, at the very least, prompt a strong counter-offer that we can work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000 for the product, but no higher. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position, Diminishing Returns:** While not ideal, Bob's final offer of $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than our guaranteed $1,500,000 with John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations risks Bob walking away entirely, leaving us with the $1,500,000. The potential gain from pushing further is outweighed by the potential loss.
* **""Final Offer"" Respected:** Bob has also used the ""final offer"" tactic, indicating he's unlikely to move further. 

It's time to secure a good deal rather than risk losing a significant profit."
