"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  That way, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think!",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8500. Would you be willing to meet me at $8750? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8750 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I'd need to see $9000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8500. I'm willing to make one more offer. Would you be willing to meet me at $8700? I'm trying to find a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",8700.0,Bob,6,
