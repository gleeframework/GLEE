"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $13,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. To better align with your budget while still ensuring a reasonable profit for us, I propose a revised price of $13,000 for the product. This still represents a premium compared to its value to us, but it's closer to your offer, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $13,000 is closer, it's still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?",12800.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering your willingness to increase your offer, I believe we can find a solution that suits both of us. I propose a final price of $12,950 for the product. This price is higher than your last offer but still below our initial asking price. It allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while making the deal more appealing to you. I hope this proposal is acceptable, and we can move forward with the transaction.",12950.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your flexibility, $12,950 is still just a bit above what I can comfortably pay. Let's try $12,850. This is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price.  What do you think?",12850.0,Bob,6,
