Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $11,000. This is likely to be rejected by Bob, but it establishes my starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get at least $10,000 from John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware of the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired $10,000. It's also a price that Bob might consider given his value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,800 is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I could get from John. Given the potential for further negotiation, it's unlikely Bob will budge much higher.  I'm going to sell to John to guarantee my minimum profit."
