"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120.  It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for me.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, you're aiming to save as much as possible. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, and you know the product is worth $80 to Alice. It's worth exploring a lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which still leaves you with a good profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal for you. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $120 to $110, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, you're still aiming for a lower price. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, so there's no need to rush into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and lets us close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $108?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, demonstrating a strong desire to close the deal.  However, you're still within your budget and can potentially negotiate a lower price. You have several rounds left and should continue to push for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit higher than I'd like. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer you $106.50, which is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 106.5}
