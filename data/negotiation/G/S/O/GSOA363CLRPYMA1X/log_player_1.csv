""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

This offer takes into account a few things:

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring you make a significant profit. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that's appealing enough to accept."
