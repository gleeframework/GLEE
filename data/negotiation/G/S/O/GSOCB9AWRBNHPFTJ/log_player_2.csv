Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both trying to find a common ground.  $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? I'm feeling flexible at this point, and I think this price is fair considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with your offer.  Let's meet in the middle again, at $950,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for you, and it's getting closer to what I need. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is consistently moving towards a more reasonable price. At $950,000, we're getting a $50,000 discount from John's price. Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better deal, but the potential savings are getting smaller and there's a risk Alice might not budge much further. Accepting now secures a good price."
