"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $140 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if I can improve my offer. How about $135 for the product? This is my best offer given its value to you.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me.  $135 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  Let's split the difference - how about $132.50? That's a good compromise for both of us.",132.5,Bob,4,
