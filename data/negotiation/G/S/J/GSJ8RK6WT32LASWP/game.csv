,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product, given its value and my budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're confident in the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still a bit outside my range.  I'm happy to go up to $1,800,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
