,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $107.50? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",107.5,Bob,4,
