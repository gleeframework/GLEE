Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum threshold. This gives me some room to negotiate while ensuring I still get a good deal.  I'm also framing the message in a friendly and positive way to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum threshold. This shows flexibility while also maintaining a profitable deal for me. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $107.50? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum price, even with compromise.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John.  I'd rather get a sure thing for $120 than continue to negotiate with Bob and risk getting less."
