"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I believe it's a game-changer. To start the negotiation, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping it will motivate him to accept a higher price.
* **Openness to Discussion:** The message ends with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation.

**Remember:** This is just the first offer, and I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. After considering its worth to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1400000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my desired outcome than John's offer, but it's still lower than my ideal price.**  I believe I can get closer to my desired $1,500,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **I want to see if I can push for a higher price.**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to concede in the next round. I'll also need to think about how to frame my counteroffer to maximize my chances of closing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is a good price, I'm still a bit away from my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product brings to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a concession by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,300,000, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, subtly reminding him of the benefits he'll gain from the purchase. 
* **Positive Framing:** I use phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""close the deal"" to create a sense of optimism and encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to find a price that is both acceptable to Bob and allows me to maximize my profit. I believe a price of $1,300,000 is a good balance, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
