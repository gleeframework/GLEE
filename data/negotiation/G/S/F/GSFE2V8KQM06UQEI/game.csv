"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1400000 is a good price, I'm still a bit away from my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This price reflects the significant value this product brings to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
