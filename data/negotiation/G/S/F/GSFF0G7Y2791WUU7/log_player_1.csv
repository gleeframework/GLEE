Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
