"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, and Alice's offer is too high.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. It's lower than what he'd pay John, and it's likely the best deal he'll get from Alice."
