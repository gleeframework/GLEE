"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, I'll have room to negotiate down.  I'll also be keeping an eye on the 10 round limit and my option to sell to John if the deal doesn't go through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell right away. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John if needed. I'll try to get closer to my target price by counter-offering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering the price a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a significant profit.  I'm hoping this will make Bob more interested in negotiating, but if not, I'll continue adjusting my offer in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to risk it.  I'm not yet at the point where selling to John feels like the best option, as there are still 6 rounds left and the potential to get a better price. I'll counter-offer again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm lowering the price again, but I'm still aiming for a profit. It's getting close to my minimum, but I believe I can still squeeze out a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is getting uncomfortably close to my minimum, I'm still holding out hope. I have 4 rounds left, and I think I can get a better price.  I'll counter-offer again and see if I can get Bob to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000} 
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer but still trying to get a better price.  We only have three rounds left, so I need to be more aggressive in my counter-offer.  Hopefully, this will convince Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left and Bob's offer getting increasingly low, it's time to cut my losses.  Selling to John for $800,000 is the best option now.  While it's not my ideal price, it still ensures I get at least my minimum, and I don't risk getting an even lower offer from Bob."
