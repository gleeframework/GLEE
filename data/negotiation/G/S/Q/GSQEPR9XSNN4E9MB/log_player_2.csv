"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price that I think you'll find very reasonable. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's price:**  Alice is selling the product for $14,000, while John would sell it for $15,000.
* **Your goal is to save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John.

While Alice's offer is still higher than the product's worth to her, it's the best deal for you considering your other option."
