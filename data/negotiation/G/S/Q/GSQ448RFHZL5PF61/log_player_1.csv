Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we try $11,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, I believe."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Bob has consistently offered $11,000, and I'm only 4 rounds away from having to sell to John for $10,000. It's time to take the sure thing and secure a sale at a price that's close to my desired value."
