"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $800,000. Would you be open to discussing this further?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to consider my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the best I can do. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $900,000 is really the highest I can go. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $900,000. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I can only go up to $980,000. That's the lowest I can go without losing money on this deal. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close.  I'm willing to move a bit to $920,000 to get this done today. Let me know if that works for you.",920000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I can see you're really close to the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $960,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that if we don't meet at this price, I might need to explore other options. What do you think?",960000.0,Alice,7,
