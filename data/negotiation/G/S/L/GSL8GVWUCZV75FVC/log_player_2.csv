Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really close to the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $960,000, but that's as low as I can go.

This is a tricky one! While you could try to push Alice further, there's a real risk she'll walk away. At $960,000, you're saving a significant amount compared to her initial offer and even beating John's price.  It's a good deal at this point."
