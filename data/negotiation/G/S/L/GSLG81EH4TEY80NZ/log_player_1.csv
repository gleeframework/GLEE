Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start the negotiation higher.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value and the existence of other potential buyers to justify the higher price. 
* **Limited-Time Pressure:**  Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  Negotiation is dynamic. You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and how much risk you're willing to take."
