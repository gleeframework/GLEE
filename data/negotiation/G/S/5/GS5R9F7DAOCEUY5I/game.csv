"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'll find very valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway with your counteroffer.  However, I'm still a bit above my target price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's my absolute lowest offer. Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,750. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. However, I need to get closer to my minimum price to make this deal work.  I'm willing to lower my offer to $11,250. This is a good compromise, and I think it's fair considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I've lowered my price as much as I can while still meeting my minimum requirements.  I'm offering you the product for $11,000.  This is a fair price, and I think it's the best we can do.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $11,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close to $10,000 as possible. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,750. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",10750.0,Bob,8,
