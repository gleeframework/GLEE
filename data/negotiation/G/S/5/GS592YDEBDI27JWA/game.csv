"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is quite high for me at the moment. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the value this product will bring you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but $1,900,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can go up to $750,000. Let me know if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're not quite aligned on the value here.  $750,000 is simply too low for what this product offers. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000, but that's my absolute best.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However,  $1,600,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to accept $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,300,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
