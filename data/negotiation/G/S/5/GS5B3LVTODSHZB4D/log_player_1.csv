Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum asking price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000. This would still give you a good profit while being a more attractive price for me. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
The goal is to maximize profit. While $9,000 is a decent profit, there's still room for negotiation and potentially earning more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price is still a great deal for you, as it's well below your estimated value. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
