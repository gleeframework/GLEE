"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's minimum asking price. Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate and can always buy from John for $12,000. It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000. This would still give you a good profit while being a more attractive price for me. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price is still a great deal for you, as it's well below your estimated value. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is significantly closer to Bob's ideal price of $9,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed he'll get a better price. He also has to consider the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer saves Bob $2,500 compared to buying from John and is a good compromise."
