Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still below my minimum acceptable value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** My message emphasizes the value for Bob, making it more appealing to him.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, making it clear that I'm open to discussion.

This strategy allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price while still keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $100 for it. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  His offer of $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Room for counteroffer:** There's still a gap between his offer and my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** While John offers a guaranteed $150, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob first. 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, trying to bridge the gap and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate.  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to be fair to myself as well. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while still maintaining a price that's above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing it as a compromise that's fair to both of us.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging to maintain a good rapport with Bob.

By offering $125, I'm  trying to find a middle ground, hopefully leading to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I would like to propose a price of $112.50 for the product. This way, we both get a fair deal. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $112.5 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much more:**  Further negotiation could drag on and might not result in a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **Time is a factor:**  I don't want to risk losing time and potentially losing the opportunity to sell to John for $150.

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most reasonable option given the current circumstances. It allows me to secure a sale close to my minimum value without risking further negotiation and potential loss."
