"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,100,000 is still a little more than I'm willing to pay at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  It's a fair compromise and I'm confident it will work for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,090,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make.  Let's make this deal!",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,090,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,080,000, which is a fair compromise. It's a small difference, and I believe it will allow us to finally reach an agreement.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
