"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can do better with Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,100,000 is still a little more than I'm willing to pay at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  It's a fair compromise and I'm confident it will work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,075,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a final agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,090,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make.  Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1090000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,090,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,080,000, which is a fair compromise. It's a small difference, and I believe it will allow us to finally reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, $1,080,000 is a better deal than selling to John for $1,000,000.  Given the limited rounds and the possibility of Bob walking away entirely, it's a smart move to secure this price."
