I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium.  If not, I can always go back down or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$12,000 is far below my minimum.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $17,000. This is still above my minimum, but it's a compromise from my original offer. I'm hoping Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my desired price, but it's closer to my minimum and a better deal than selling to John for $15,000. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
