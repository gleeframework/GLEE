Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is $10,000, it implies a higher value by using phrases like ""significant value"" and ""worthwhile investment."" 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice is secure knowing that if Bob rejects the offer, she can still sell the product to John for her minimum price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know anything about Bob's negotiation style or financial flexibility. It's possible he'll outright reject a price above his perceived value.
* **Relationship:** If Alice wants to build a long-term relationship with Bob, a less aggressive starting price might be more suitable."
