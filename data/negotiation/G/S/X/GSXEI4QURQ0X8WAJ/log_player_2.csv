"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above his $1,000,000 limit. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to stay within my budget.  I'm happy to consider your product at $950,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's price. This shows his serious intent to negotiate and sets the stage for potential concessions from Alice.  He is aiming for a price point close to his $1,000,000 limit but leaves some room for negotiation to ensure the deal can still close."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm confident the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to Bob's limit, but it's still a bit higher than what he wants to pay.  Given that there are more rounds available, Bob can still try to push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his absolute maximum price, aiming to close the deal while staying within his budget. This offer is bold but signals a clear intention to finalize the purchase, potentially pressuring Alice to accept.  He's leaving no room for further concessions and is essentially pushing Alice to make a final decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,015,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still $15,000 over Bob's budget. While the negotiation has been fruitful,  Bob is now faced with a choice: risk further rounds with potentially no improvement or secure the product from John for his maximum price.  Since Bob has already stated his absolute maximum and Alice is firm on her price, it's more prudent to buy from John and avoid potentially losing the opportunity altogether."
