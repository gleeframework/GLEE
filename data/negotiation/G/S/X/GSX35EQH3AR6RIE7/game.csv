,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $825,000? This allows for some room for negotiation, but also ensures I'm compensated for the product's true value.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $775,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal without further delay.",800000.0,Alice,5,
