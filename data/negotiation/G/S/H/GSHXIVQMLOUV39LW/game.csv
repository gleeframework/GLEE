"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer of $580000, which is the same as my previous offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $1200000. I'm hoping we can still come to an agreement, but I need to be realistic about my budget.",580000.0,Bob,8,
