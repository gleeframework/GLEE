Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves you room to potentially negotiate down to $13,000 while still exceeding your minimum sale price. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, hoping to nudge Bob towards accepting a price closer to your asking price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. You could start higher and be willing to negotiate more aggressively, but that increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright."
