"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its worth, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both see the inherent value in this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This acknowledges your interest while recognizing the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find an agreement that works for both of us. However, $1,700,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,825,000, but that's my best offer.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,825,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
