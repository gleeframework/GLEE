"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $650,000 at this time.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit away from what I'm comfortable paying.  How about $700,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in it. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",725000.0,Alice,5,
