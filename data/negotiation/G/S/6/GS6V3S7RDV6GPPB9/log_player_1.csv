Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well above your value for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

How about $1,300,000? This still leaves you a significant profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
