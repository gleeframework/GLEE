"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is a better price than John's $10,000, you can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $9,000? I'm really interested in this product and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, but $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is the same as her initial offer. Since you've already countered and she rejected it, there's a good chance you can get her lower than $9,500. There's no need to accept her offer now, as it won't get you a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for $9,500, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $9,250? It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your offer, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,800? I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is still better than buying from John for $10,000.  While you'd prefer a lower price, it's likely that further negotiation won't get you much lower. Accepting the offer saves you $200 and ensures you get the product."
