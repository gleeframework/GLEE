Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing your potential earnings.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a ""limited time"" element can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without overthinking it.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, having John as a backup buyer guarantees you'll at least make your minimum acceptable price."
