"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested, but only if we can get the price down significantly. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. $6,000 is quite low, but I understand you have a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product provides.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $10,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to go up to $7,000, but that's my absolute limit.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but the value this product offers is truly significant.  How about we settle on $9,000? That's a substantial reduction from my original ask and a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I could do $7,500, but that's really the best I can offer. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you're okay with it.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference - $8,250 and we have a deal.  This product is going to make a real difference for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",8250.0,Alice,7,
