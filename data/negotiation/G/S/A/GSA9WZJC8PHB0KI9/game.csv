"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $900,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000.

"Hi Bob, I understand you're making a serious offer, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already gone further than I initially intended, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to make one final offer: $1,015,000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,7,
