Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're making a serious offer, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already gone further than I initially intended, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to make one final offer: $1,015,000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?

This is a good point to accept the offer. Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and the price difference between continuing to negotiate and buying from John is getting smaller. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significant savings."
