I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This price is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum threshold of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and although I could sell to John for the same price, I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I'm hoping it'll be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Bob's offer of $12,500 is closer to my desired price point, and is higher than what John is offering. Accepting this offer will give me a good profit and save time on further negotiation."
