"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,
