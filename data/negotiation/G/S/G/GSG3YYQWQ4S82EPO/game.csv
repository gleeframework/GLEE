"I have a unique opportunity to sell you a high-end product, and I'm excited to share it with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"That's a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but could you do $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about $14,000? That's closer to my budget while still acknowledging the product's value.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $14,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. I can do $16,000, and that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my costs.",16000.0,Alice,5,
