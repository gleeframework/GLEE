"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit on the price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This would give you a significant profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
