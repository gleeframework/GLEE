"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to the mark, I believe the value of this product is significantly higher. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,450,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,275,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
