"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. To start the negotiation, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's a common negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly. 
* **Aiming Above Bob's Valuation:** While I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, I'm aiming for a price significantly higher. This is because:
    * I want to maximize my profit.
    *  Negotiations often involve concessions, and starting high gives me more room to make them.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides a safety net. I won't feel pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than his perceived value of the product ($1,000,000), indicating room for negotiation. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, so accepting anything below that wouldn't be maximizing my profit. I'll counter-offer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to the mark, I believe the value of this product is significantly higher. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,450,000?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've reduced my price by $150,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to make a deal. 
* **Targeting Above John's Offer:**  My goal remains to secure a price higher than John's standing offer of $1,200,000.  
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counter-offer keeps the negotiation active while still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,450,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,275,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeds John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is higher than the $1,200,000 John is guaranteeing.
* **Strong Position Achieved:** We've successfully negotiated a price well above Bob's initial offer and significantly closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob altogether, potentially forcing me to accept John's offer. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome."
