Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefit it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, we want to secure the highest price possible above our minimum ($10,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a small buffer for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as fair, encouraging Bob to accept. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer, but it's a calculated one. We have a fallback option (John) to ensure we sell the product at our minimum acceptable price."
