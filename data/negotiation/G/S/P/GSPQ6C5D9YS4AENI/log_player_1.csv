Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,100,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and makes him feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** While we start high, we don't want to price Bob out completely.  $1,100,000 is a significant profit margin for you while still being potentially attractive to Bob if he values the product's unique aspects.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a strong fallback position with John. This knowledge empowers you to be firm in your negotiation with Bob. 
 
Let me know what Bob's response is!"
