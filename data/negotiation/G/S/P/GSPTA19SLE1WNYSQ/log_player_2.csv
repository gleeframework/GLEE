"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a great price. I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Opening:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a better deal. 
* **Polite & Open to Negotiation:** The message remains respectful and expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging further discussion. 
* **Goal in Mind:** Our ultimate goal is to buy for under $80, but this low starting point gives us flexibility as we see how Alice responds in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, indicating she's willing to negotiate.
* **Still Room for Improvement:**  While $82.50 is closer to Alice's value, it's still above our target. We have time to try and negotiate a lower price.
* **Alternative Exists:** We can always buy from John for $100, so we have a safety net if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to work with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're proposing a price that's roughly halfway between Alice's current offer ($82.50) and our previous offer ($65). This shows we're willing to meet in the middle.
* **Direct & Clear:** The message is straightforward and suggests a specific price, encouraging Alice to respond directly.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** While closer to Alice's value, $75 is still a good deal for us and keeps us below our alternative option of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $77.50, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Let me think about it... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $77.50 is a good price, only $2.50 away from Alice's value and well below our $100 alternative. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Alice is signaling she might not go much lower. Rejecting this offer risks her sticking to this price or even walking away in later rounds. 
* **Time Investment:** Continuing the negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting now secures a good deal without further hassle."
