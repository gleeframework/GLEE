"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a price of $13,500 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $13,500 is still too high, and he can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $13,500 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer for the product is $13,000. I hope this aligns better with your budget and we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject the offer. While $13,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are still rounds left, and he might be able to get closer to his target price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $13,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $12,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After careful consideration, I am prepared to offer the product to you for $12,900. I believe this price reflects the value you see in the product while also being competitive with your offer. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's slightly above his ideal price of $12,000, it's still a good deal considering the value of the product to Alice ($15,000). It's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate a lower price in the remaining rounds, and buying from John would cost him the same amount ($12,000).  He's saving $100 by accepting Alice's offer."
