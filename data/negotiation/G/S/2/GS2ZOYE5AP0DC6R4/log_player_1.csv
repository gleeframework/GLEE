"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me and the potential for future growth. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum than his initial offer, I believe I can still get closer to my target price with further negotiation.  I want to see if I can nudge him higher."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $950,000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $925,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me and allows us to move forward with a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $925,000 is tempting, I'm still confident that I can push him a bit higher.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $1 million before considering selling to John."
