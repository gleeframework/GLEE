"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product at $100, which is still lower than what it's worth to Bob, but gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly and open tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value consideration:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum threshold of $80, I believe the product is worth more and I still have room to negotiate. 
* **Strategic rejection:** Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain control and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Exploring options:** By proceeding to the next round, I can make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a little more. How about $95?  That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm proposing a price that is higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility while remaining firm on my goal to get as close to $100 as possible. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** My message emphasizes that this price would allow both of us to be satisfied, encouraging Bob to compromise.
* **Continued negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise and is close to my desired price of $100.
* **Time factor:** We are nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and it's important to reach an agreement before time runs out.
* **Avoiding John:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures I receive a better price than what John is offering.

This decision balances the goal of getting the highest price with the reality of the limited negotiation rounds."
