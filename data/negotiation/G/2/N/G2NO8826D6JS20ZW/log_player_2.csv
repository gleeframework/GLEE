Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you,  I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80.  It's best to reject the offer and start negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm going to try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $100 is close, but I can't go that low.  My absolute bottom price is $120.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is still above my maximum budget.  While we're getting closer, I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially getting stuck at a price higher than what John is offering. I'm going to go with the guaranteed deal from John at $80."
