Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,500,000 creates a price floor.  Alice should aim for more than this if possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly reminding Bob he might lose the opportunity if he declines.

**Why this approach is better than simply asking for $1,500,000:**

* Directly asking Bob for $1,500,000 leaves no room for negotiation.  It's possible Bob might be willing to pay slightly more than $1,000,000, but significantly less than $1,500,000.  
* Starting high but leaving room for negotiation allows Alice to gauge Bob's true interest and potentially secure an even better deal."
