"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $100?  That's my absolute top limit.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $125?  I'm pretty flexible on that price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $110?  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
