"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $720,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $720,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $780,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and shows my desire to reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal!",780000.0,Alice,5,
