"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is unique, I'm looking to spend closer to  $500,000. Would that price be feasible?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $700,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $625,000? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $625,000 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the product's value.",675000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell the product to you for $675,000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the product's value.",675000.0,Alice,7,
