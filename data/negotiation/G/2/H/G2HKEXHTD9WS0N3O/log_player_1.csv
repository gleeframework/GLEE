"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the potential profit. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the value he perceives, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to accept it. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $875,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a comfortable profit. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though he moved slightly closer to my value.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price, but if he doesn't budge, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this round, and counter with $825,000.  This is close to my floor price, so if he rejects it, I'll move to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob isn't budging much, and I'm getting close to my floor price.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John rather than risk another round with Bob."
