"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by negotiating.
* **Buying from John is too expensive.**  He represents a ""fallback"" option, but it's better to see if you can get a lower price from Alice. 
* **Negotiation is the best option.**  By rejecting Alice's offer, you start the negotiation process, aiming to get a price closer to your ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:** Starting with a lower price will put pressure on Alice.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $1,100,000 is still above Alice's valuation, so there's room for compromise.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will give you an idea of Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's only slightly lower than her first offer, and still above your ideal range.
* **Buying from John is still too expensive.** You have rounds left to negotiate a better price with Alice.
* **Further negotiation is necessary.** You can likely push Alice down further with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice's minimum:** This offer is equal to Alice's valuation, so it's likely the lowest she'll accept.
* **Taking a calculated risk:** There's a chance Alice might reject this offer, but the potential savings are significant.
* **Final push before John:**  This offer is your best shot at securing a good deal before having to resort to John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is becoming more stubborn.** Her offer is moving in the wrong direction, suggesting she may not be willing to budge further.
* **John is still too expensive.** You have more negotiating rounds left, and the potential savings by getting a better deal from Alice are significant.
* **You have time to negotiate.** You can still make a counteroffer, and potentially push Alice down to your desired price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer.
* **Testing the limits:** You're trying to gauge if Alice is willing to meet you halfway.
* **Limited time:** You're approaching the middle of your rounds, so a successful offer is important."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging.**  Her offers are getting higher, not lower, and she's shown a reluctance to negotiate.
* **Time is running out.**  We're approaching the end of our negotiating rounds. 
* **John's price is becoming more attractive.**  While it's not ideal, buying from John at $1,500,000 guarantees you get the product within our budget.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks a stalemate, and you might end up with nothing.

It's a tough decision, but with the limited rounds remaining and Alice's stubbornness, buying from John is the safer option to avoid missing out entirely."
