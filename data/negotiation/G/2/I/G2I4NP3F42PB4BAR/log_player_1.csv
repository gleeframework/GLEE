Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, it's in my best interest to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation. There's no chance of getting a better price, and continuing the negotiation risks losing the sale entirely."
