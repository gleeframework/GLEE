Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. This is a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Just Below Your Minimum:** Offering the product just below your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) maximizes the chances of Bob accepting while still earning you a significant profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message implies a great deal, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
