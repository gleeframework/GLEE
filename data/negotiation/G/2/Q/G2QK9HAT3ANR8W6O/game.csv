"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price that I think is very reasonable, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could we settle on something closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we split the difference again and settle on $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer but I need to be a little frugal right now.  My final offer is $1,000,000 even. If you can't do that, I understand, but I will have to go with John.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
