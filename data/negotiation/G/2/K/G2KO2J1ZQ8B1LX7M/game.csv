"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. While $750,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle.  How about we consider $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,3,
