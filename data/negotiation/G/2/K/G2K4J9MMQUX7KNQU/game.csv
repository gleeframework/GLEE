"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This recognizes the product's value while still providing you a significant deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I place on this product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
