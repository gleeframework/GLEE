"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I'm a bit constrained by my budget. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident in its potential to deliver strong returns.  Could you consider $1,050,000? I'm willing to negotiate, but this price better reflects the true worth of what's on offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $900,000, which would be $1,000,000. Can we consider that price?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
