"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that 120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 105? It's a great price for a fantastic product like this!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $105 is still a bit high for me.  How about $100?  That's the price I'm willing to pay.  Let's make this deal happen.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're serious about buying the product! I understand that 100 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at 110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
