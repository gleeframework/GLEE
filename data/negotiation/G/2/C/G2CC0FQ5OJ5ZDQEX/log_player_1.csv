Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to him. I'm confident I can get a better price."

Round 3

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a slight improvement, it's still below what I know the product is worth to him. I'm not willing to settle for that. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can get a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too far off from what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.

Bob has offered me $1,000,000, which is exactly what I know the product is worth to him and what I would get from John. It's time to accept his offer and close the deal."
