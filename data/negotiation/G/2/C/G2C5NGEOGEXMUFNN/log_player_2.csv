"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's strategic to begin negotiations significantly lower than your actual maximum price ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""too high for my budget"") makes your counteroffer seem more reasonable and less like a random lowball. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone suggests you're serious about purchasing but need to find a price that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a considerable reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice only reduced her price by $100,000, indicating she's trying to hold onto a higher profit margin.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We're still significantly away from both your target price and a potential compromise. 
* **John is an Option:** Having John as a backup provides a safety net if negotiations stall or become unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product holds value, but that price is still a bit out of reach for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging my budget constraints."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** Showing a willingness to move upward in smaller increments ($50,000 this round) signals a serious attempt to reach an agreement. 
* **Reaffirming Budget:** Reiterating your budget limitations helps manage Alice's expectations and emphasizes the need for her to move closer to your range.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The tone aims to find a middle ground that works for both parties, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm ready to make another adjustment. Let's settle this at $925,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end and is a firm offer.  I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice's price reduction is the largest yet, $925,000 remains significantly above your $800,000 maximum. 
* **Time Pressure:** With half the rounds remaining, continuing to counter-offer keeps the pressure on Alice to move closer to your range. 
* **John is the Backup:**  Knowing you can get the product for $800,000 from John provides leverage.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate Alice's price down further before resorting to John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, my absolute top limit for this product is $800,000. That's already a significant investment for me.  If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Revealing Your Maximum:**  With time running out, it's strategic to reveal your true maximum price to Alice. This shows you're serious and eliminates any uncertainty about your willingness to pay more.
* **Firm but Fair:** The tone is direct and assertive but emphasizes that $800,000 is your final offer. 
* **Urgency to Close:** Expressing your readiness to ""close the deal today"" adds pressure and encourages a quick decision from Alice."
