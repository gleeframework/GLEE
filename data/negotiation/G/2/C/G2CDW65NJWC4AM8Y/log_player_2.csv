"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth is $1,000,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal. He should try to negotiate further before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, considering my maximum budget is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth is $1,000,000 to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price for Bob.  While he might be able to get a slightly lower price, there's a risk of Alice rejecting further offers. Accepting this offer saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John."
