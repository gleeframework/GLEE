Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the price of $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,250,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'll counter Bob's offer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but unfortunately, $1,250,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $1,500,000 is my absolute minimum. This still offers you a significant value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but $1,500,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,375,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it could bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,375,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm confident that selling to John guarantees me the best possible outcome in this situation."
