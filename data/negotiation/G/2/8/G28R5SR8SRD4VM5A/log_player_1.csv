Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** The lowest price you'll accept is $12,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to him.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $10,000 and $12,000.  Any price within this range could lead to a deal.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $12,000 risks Bob rejecting the deal.  A slightly more aggressive approach within the ZOPA is ideal.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its quality and the value it brings."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and highlights the product's benefit to Bob.
* **Strategic Price:** $11,500 is within the ZOPA, giving you a strong profit margin while still being enticing for Bob compared to your guaranteed $12,000.
* **Justification:**  Briefly mentioning ""quality and value"" provides a reason for the price without revealing your bottom line. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. Negotiation is dynamic, and Bob's response might require you to adjust your strategy in further communication."
