Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. I've priced it at $1,150,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving me room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $1,150,000 allows for potential compromises without dropping below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and open tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Prepared for a Counteroffer:** I'm aware Bob might counter, and I'm ready to respond with further counteroffers if necessary. 
* **Back-up Option:**  I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if I don't feel the negotiation is leading to a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it signals that he's interested in the product. There's still room for negotiation.
* **Seeking a Better Deal:**  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer and continuing the negotiation. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John would guarantee $1,200,000, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,150,000 to $1,050,000, showing flexibility while still being above Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, emphasizing why $1,050,000 is a fair price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  If Bob still rejects, I'll have more room to come down a bit further in the next round. 
* **Avoid selling to John:** I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob, potentially getting a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, $950,000 is still significantly below my desired value.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I might be able to get a price closer to my desired value by making another counteroffer.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John would guarantee $1,200,000, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.
* **Time is a factor:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more likely I am to sell to John to avoid the risk of losing the opportunity altogether. 

I'll make a final counteroffer to see if I can reach a mutually acceptable price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, but $950,000 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll be selling to someone else. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm putting pressure on Bob by making this my final offer. This emphasizes the urgency and creates a sense of urgency for Bob to accept. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. This shows my willingness to negotiate, while also preserving my bottom line. 
* **Threat of Selling to John:** I'm reminding Bob that I have a backup option, making him aware that he risks losing out on the product if he doesn't accept.
* **Clear Decision Point:**  I'm giving Bob a clear choice with a definitive deadline, forcing him to decide whether he's willing to close the deal or let it go.

This approach aims to maximize my chances of getting a better price than John's offer while also minimizing the risk of losing the deal completely."
