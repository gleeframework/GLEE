"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $950000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $1025000? This still leaves you a good margin for profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $980000 is an improvement, it's still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is exactly what this product is worth to you. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
