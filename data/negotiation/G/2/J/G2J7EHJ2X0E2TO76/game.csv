"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider something closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $17,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend. To be honest, I'm considering another seller who has a similar product. If you're able to come down to $8,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.",8000.0,Bob,4,
