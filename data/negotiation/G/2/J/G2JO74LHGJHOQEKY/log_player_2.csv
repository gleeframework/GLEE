"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $10,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's find a way to make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John and secure the product at my desired price. Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but it risks losing the deal entirely or wasting time.  John provides a certain and affordable option."
