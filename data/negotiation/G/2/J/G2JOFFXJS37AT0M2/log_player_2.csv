Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell it for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $11,500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really like it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, it's unlikely she'll go below $11,500. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $10,000 from John.  It makes the most financial sense to take the sure thing and save $1,500."
