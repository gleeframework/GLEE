"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? This product is truly top-of-the-line, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $17,000 is a bit low for what I had in mind.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $18,500?  This is my final offer.",18500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to split the difference, but $18,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle at $17,500?",17500.0,Bob,6,
