"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a good chance you can get a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of time to see if you can reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for potential compromise. It's likely Alice will counter, but this sets a clear starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a good price considering your goal is to save as much as possible.  Accepting this offer saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John. There's always the chance you could get a lower price with further negotiation, but the risk of losing the deal altogether increases with each round. It's a good balance between savings and the potential of reaching a better deal."
