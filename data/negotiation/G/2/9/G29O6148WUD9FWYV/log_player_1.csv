{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still leaving a profit margin. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and direct, highlighting the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By offering a slightly higher price, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his willingness to negotiate and adjust my strategy accordingly.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a profitable sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and either accept it, make a counteroffer, or move on to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price at this point.  

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,100,000, but I'll be prepared to adjust based on Bob's response."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your position, $900,000 is significantly below the value of the product.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $1,050,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate the value of the product and my willingness to compromise.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's seriousness and willingness to negotiate further.  If he's truly interested, he'll likely come up from his previous offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a profitable sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and either accept it, make a counteroffer, or move on to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1025000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob.  I'll aim for a price closer to my preferred range, perhaps $1,100,000. If he's truly serious about buying, he should be willing to move a little higher.  If not, I'll move on to John."
