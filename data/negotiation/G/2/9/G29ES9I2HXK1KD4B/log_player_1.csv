Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is more than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering at $110. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, $100 is a good deal. It's significantly more than selling to John, and it seems unlikely Bob will offer much higher. I'll accept his offer."
