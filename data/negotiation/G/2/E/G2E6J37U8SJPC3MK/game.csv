"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's the lowest I can go without losing too much. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000. This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
