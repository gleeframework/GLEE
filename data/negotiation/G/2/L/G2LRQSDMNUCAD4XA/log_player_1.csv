Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $11,000? It's still a good value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
