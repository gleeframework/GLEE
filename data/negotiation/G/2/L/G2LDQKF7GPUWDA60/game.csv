"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $10500 as the final price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $11250. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $11250 is still a bit high. I'm willing to offer $11000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need to make a slight adjustment to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $11200. I think this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",11200.0,Alice,7,
