"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $11,000 is still above your maximum price point of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Start by making a counteroffer that is closer to Alice's perceived value of $10,000 than your own maximum of $12,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Message:** Keep the message friendly and positive. Acknowledging Alice's offer and highlighting your willingness to negotiate helps build rapport."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $10500 as the final price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $11500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:**  You're increasing your offer from the previous round but staying below your maximum price point. This shows flexibility while pushing for a price that's more favorable to you.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $11,250 is still a bit high. I'm willing to offer $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need to make a slight adjustment to ensure I'm getting a fair price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is still above your maximum price point of $12,000. With only three rounds left, it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John for $12,000 ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not yield a better outcome."
