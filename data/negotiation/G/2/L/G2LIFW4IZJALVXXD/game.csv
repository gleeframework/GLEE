"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm not quite there yet. How about $950,000? That's a fair compromise, and it still leaves you with a good profit margin.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $920,000. Can we meet in the middle?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $930,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's aim for $935,000.  This gives us both a good deal.",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to stay above $930,000, but I'm still not comfortable with $935,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $930,000, which is $925,000. Can we agree on that?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I can't go any lower than $930,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to keep the deal viable. I'm hoping you'll see it the same way. Let's aim for $930,000 and move forward.",930000.0,Alice,7,
