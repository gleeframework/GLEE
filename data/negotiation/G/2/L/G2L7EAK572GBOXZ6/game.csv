"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price given the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you be open to $700,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $700,000 is still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",850000.0,Alice,5,
