"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob. While selling to John is safe, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budget.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
