"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and potentially getting a higher price. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm asking an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a higher price than $85. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to pay $90 for the product? I believe it's worth it!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm counteroffering with $90, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $87 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $87 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I would like to get closer to my initial target, with only 6 rounds remaining, it's in my best interest to accept the offer.  This ensures I make a profit while still avoiding the risk of losing a sale altogether."
