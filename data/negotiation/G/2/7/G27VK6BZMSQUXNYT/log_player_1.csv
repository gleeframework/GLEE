"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit steep at $2000000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's features and potential benefits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
