"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at the same price, there's no immediate benefit to accepting. You can always reject her offer and go with John, who is also offering the product for your maximum price.  This gives you the option to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice later or explore other options."
