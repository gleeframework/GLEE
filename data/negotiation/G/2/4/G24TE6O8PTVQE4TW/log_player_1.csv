Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob, while still ensuring you make a significant profit above his perceived value.
* **Direct and clear communication:**  The message is straightforward and encourages a response from Bob."
