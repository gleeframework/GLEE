"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer near Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and emphasizing the product's value to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""starting price"" implies I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below Bob's perceived value of the product ($10,000) and my initial asking price. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to come down slightly in price but not to $8,500 yet. I'm confident I can get a better deal by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and perspective to maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by dropping $500 from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm above Bob's initial counter.
* **""Meet in the middle"":** This framing suggests a fair and straightforward deal while keeping the negotiation moving towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but I think that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $8,800 is a reasonable profit above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has incrementally increased his offer, indicating seriousness. While I believe he might go slightly higher, the potential gain is relatively small compared to the risk of him walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation further increases the risk of losing the sale to other factors or Bob changing his mind. It's better to secure a good deal now."
