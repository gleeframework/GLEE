{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,500,000. It's a rare opportunity and I believe it holds significant value for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer sets a high starting point, allowing for potential negotiation.  The message emphasizes the product's unique value, hoping to pique Bob's interest. 

It's important to remember that this is just the beginning. I'll need to be flexible and adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and my goal of maximizing profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to accept $900,000, it's not worth jeopardizing my profit margin. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer.  This price still allows for a fair profit while acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While negotiating with Bob further is an option, the risk of further price reductions or a stalemate isn't worth it.  

It's more secure and efficient to sell to John for $1,200,000, ensuring a guaranteed profit that meets my minimum requirement."
