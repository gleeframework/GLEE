"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can bring you great benefit.  Given its worth, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price, considering its potential benefits to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is considerably below its true value and my initial asking price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the value and the significant returns you'll see.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,100,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident the product will provide value to me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is still below my initial expectations, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle this at $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,350,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
