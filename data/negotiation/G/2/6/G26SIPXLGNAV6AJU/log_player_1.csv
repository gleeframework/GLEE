{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price point that is higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also positions the product as a valuable asset for Bob.  This is a good starting point to see how Bob reacts and where he's willing to meet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is a decent offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. It's better to try and get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a little, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $9,500? It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $9,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than my ideal price, it is closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to secure a sale at this point rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's lower offer."
