"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a price of $13,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.  It's still above Alice's minimum value, giving her room to potentially counter.  The message expresses appreciation for Alice's offer while also establishing a clear starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his target.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob more negotiating room to potentially push the price down further.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob is confident he can achieve a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $11,000. This is a fair price that is close to your offer and within my budget.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small counteroffer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is close to Alice's last offer, increasing the chance of acceptance. The message continues to acknowledge Alice's position and emphasizes the fairness of the proposed price."
