I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is too low for me right now. I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $10,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum than before, I still think I can get a better deal. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting too close to my minimum price, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000, as this is the safest option and ensures I don't lose out on a potential profit."
