"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,500, which would be $8,750. Would you be willing to accept that price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $8,875. If you're serious about buying the product, this is my final offer.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750, but I need to know if that's the absolute lowest you can go. If so, I'll take it, but if not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",8750.0,Bob,6,
