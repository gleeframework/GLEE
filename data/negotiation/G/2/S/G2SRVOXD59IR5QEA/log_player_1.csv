Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest level and adjust my counteroffer accordingly.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $800,000, so I'm not afraid to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $500,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $800,000, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target. I'll counter with a price that's more reasonable while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but represents a significant decrease from my initial price. I'm hoping this will signal to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to give up my product for a price significantly lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is still slightly lower than my minimum price of $800,000, it's close enough that it's worth selling to Bob instead of going through further negotiation or selling to John.  I'm also factoring in that further negotiation might not get me a significantly higher price, and I'm not sure if Bob will accept any further counteroffers. It's important to be strategic and take the best deal available at the time."
