Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value, but still leaves me with a substantial profit.  I'm hopeful Bob will see the value and accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider a fair price. I'm going to counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable amount. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $980,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 980000}
