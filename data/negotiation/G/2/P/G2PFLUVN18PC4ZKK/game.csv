"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is my maximum offer, as I have other options.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still leaves room for both of us to make a profit.  Let's meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still out of reach for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800,000. It's a fair price for both of us, as you can always sell to John for that amount if you choose not to accept.",800000.0,Bob,4,
