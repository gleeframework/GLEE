"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to let it go for $15000, which is a one-time offer that I'm confident you won't find anywhere else. Would you like to make it yours? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 for the product, and John is offering it for that price, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer. You can get the product for the same price from John."
