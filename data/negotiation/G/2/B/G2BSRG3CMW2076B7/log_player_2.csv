"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your maximum value of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have room to negotiate a lower price, as Alice values the product at $800,000. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:** You can try a counteroffer closer to your maximum value, leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
