"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see some more flexibility on the price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above a certain price point.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?  It's a fair price that still gives you a great value.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $950,000. It's a fair price that still gives me a good deal, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. While I'm willing to be flexible, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  I'm going to come down to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll be forced to move on to other potential buyers. Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
