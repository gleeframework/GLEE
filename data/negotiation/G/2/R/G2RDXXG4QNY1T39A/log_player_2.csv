# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  $850,000 is my absolute lowest price. Let me know if this works for you.

Alice is unlikely to go below her stated lowest price of $850,000.  You can get the product for a better price from John."
