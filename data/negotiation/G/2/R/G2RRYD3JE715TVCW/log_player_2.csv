# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $975,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.

You're still within the 10 rounds, so there's time to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $925,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to budge on the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my desired price.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $950,000 is still above your budget of $800,000.  You've already rejected a similar offer in the previous round and shown your willingness to walk away.  It's likely that further negotiation will not result in a price you're comfortable with. 

It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000. You've saved time and potential further headaches by choosing the certain option."
