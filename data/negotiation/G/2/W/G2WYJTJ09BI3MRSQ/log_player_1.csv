I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for a profit. I hope Bob will see this as a fair price and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to make it worthwhile to continue negotiating.  John is offering me a guaranteed $1,200,000, and at this point, I'd rather take that than risk losing more time and money with Bob."
