"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a significant amount above Bob's perceived value.  I want to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I have 8 more rounds to work with and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $975,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between my last offer and his. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages him to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still have several rounds left and I want to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000.  This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer. I'm trying to signal that I'm willing to meet in the middle, but not at a price that significantly undervalues the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting increasingly less attractive, and I only have four rounds left.  I'm not confident that I can reach a satisfactory price with Bob in that time frame.  It's best to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
