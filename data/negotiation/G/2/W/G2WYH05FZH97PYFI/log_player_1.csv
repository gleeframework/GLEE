"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm being friendly and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing too much, keeping some bargaining power. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response. If he counteroffers, I'll need to assess his offer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or going with John's guaranteed $100 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:** Bob is offering my minimum, which means there's likely room for negotiation. 
* **Opportunity to Improve:**  I'm not willing to accept his offer just yet. I believe I can potentially get a better price. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and avoid settling for the absolute minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to Round 3 and send Bob a counteroffer.  I need to carefully consider how much I can lower my price while still maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $100 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? It's still a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial $150, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify my price and avoid appearing desperate. 
* **Reasonable Counter:**  $125 is a reasonable compromise, leaving room for further negotiation while still exceeding my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response. If he accepts, I'll finalize the deal. If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I should continue negotiating or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am proposing a price of $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're already in Round 4, meaning time is ticking away.  
* **Potential for Stalemate:** If I keep rejecting, we might reach a stalemate, and I could end up with nothing.

**Next Steps:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a decent outcome considering the circumstances. It's better than selling to John for $100, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a worse outcome."
