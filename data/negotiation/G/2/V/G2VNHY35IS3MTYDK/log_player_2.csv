"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $8,000, starting significantly lower gives me room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is courteous but clearly states my position and proposed price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial counteroffer will help gauge how flexible Alice might be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I could consider. Could you meet me halfway at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $9,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, indicating willingness to negotiate. There's a good chance she might go lower. 
* **John as Backup:** I still have the option to buy from John for $8,000 if negotiations with Alice don't reach my target price."

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $7,000.  Would that price point be doable for you?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's $9,000 and my previous $6,000, showing movement while staying within my budget range. 
* **Desired Price Range:**  By mentioning ""$7,000,"" I'm signaling that I'm getting closer to my ideal price point.
* **Maintaining Communication:** The message remains polite and collaborative, encouraging continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's settle this - I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Over Budget:** Alice's final offer of $8,500 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Final Offer:**  Alice has indicated this is her best price, making further negotiation unlikely.
* **John's Guarantee:**  John provides a guaranteed price of $8,000, ensuring I stay within budget. 

While I might have been able to negotiate Alice down a little further, it's not worth the risk of exceeding my budget. Buying from John guarantees the best price for me."
