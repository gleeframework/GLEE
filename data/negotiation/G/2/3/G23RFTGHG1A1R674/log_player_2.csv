"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, considering the potential benefits.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his target price of $12,000.  He should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $16,500 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $14,000, which is a significant step closer to my initial offer.  I'm confident we can close this deal at this price, considering the value of this product to me."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $15,750. This is a reasonable price considering the value you place on the product and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice's offer of $15,750 is still too high, and he has already had a few rounds of negotiation.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to drop her price to his target range, making it more efficient to buy from John."
