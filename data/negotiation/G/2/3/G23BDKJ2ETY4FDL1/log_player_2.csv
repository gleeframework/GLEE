"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $15,000 is Bob's maximum, there's no reason to accept the first offer.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and potentially a favorable outcome for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's maximum, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has already established a willingness to go lower, and Alice has shown flexibility. Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives Bob the opportunity to potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to inch closer to Alice's price but is still aiming for a discount. By offering $12,000, Bob shows he is serious about purchasing the product but is still looking for a deal. This counteroffer is likely to be within the range of what Alice might be willing to accept, setting up the potential for a successful negotiation in the next few rounds."
