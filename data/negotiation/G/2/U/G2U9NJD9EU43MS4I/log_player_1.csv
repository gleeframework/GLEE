Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to make a deal, $9,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'll see if I can get him closer to my price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit shy of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $9,800 is still too low for me, and I'm determined to get closer to my minimum.  I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can get Bob to agree to a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still committed to making this work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,150?  It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired outcome."", ""product_price"": 10150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I appreciate his persistence, $9,900 is still too far from my minimum price point. I'm hopeful that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can convince him to come up to a price that works for both of us. I'm not willing to settle for anything significantly below my minimum yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference again and go with $10,025?  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer that demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10025}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,950? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, it's clear that he's unwilling to come up to a price that's fair for me.  Selling to John ensures that I get my minimum price and avoids further rounds of potentially fruitless negotiations with Bob."
