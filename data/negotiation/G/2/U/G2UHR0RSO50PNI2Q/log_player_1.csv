"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and optimistic message helps to build a rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him feel like it's a good deal even at the offered price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to get as close to my minimum price of $1,200,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower.  
* **Negotiation Space:**  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. There's still room for me to push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired price, but still within a range that might make him consider it. I'll likely start at $950,000 or $975,000, and explain why my product is worth that amount."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 doesn't quite cover my costs for this unique product. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which I believe is still a great deal for you, considering its potential value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to negotiate by making a counteroffer.
* **Mid-Point:** I'm proposing a price that is closer to my desired price but still below my minimum acceptable price.  This shows flexibility.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value, hoping to make him see the $950,000 as a good investment. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  I end with an open-ended question to encourage further conversation and potentially get Bob to budge a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $920,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize my profit, and $920,000 is still far from my desired price.
* **Negotiation Space:** While Bob's offer is inching closer, there's still room to negotiate. 
* **Potential of a Better Offer:**  I'm not yet desperate to sell and believe that I can potentially get a higher price by continuing the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired price, but still within a range that might make him consider it. I'll likely start at $940,000 or $930,000, and emphasize the unique benefits of the product."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $940,000.  Remember, this product offers unique advantages that could be incredibly valuable for your business. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its potential."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but continuing to show flexibility by counter-offering.
* **Small Increment:** I'm only increasing the price by $20,000, signaling that I'm getting close to my acceptable range. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique benefits and potential to increase his business value, hoping to make the price seem more justifiable.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  The ""meet you halfway"" language implies a sense of compromise and collaboration, potentially making Bob more amenable to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $920,000, but I'd also like to discuss the payment terms. Would you be willing to consider a 20% down payment and the rest over 6 months, interest-free? I believe this would make the deal more attractive to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize my profit and $920,000 is still far from my desired price. 
* **Payment Terms:** While the payment terms are attractive, the price is still too low. I'm not desperate to sell and can potentially get a higher price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Potential of a Better Offer:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price, even if it means continuing the negotiation for a few more rounds.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer by maintaining the price but adjusting the payment terms to something more favorable for me. For example, I might propose a 30% down payment or a shorter payment period. This allows me to continue negotiating without compromising on price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and the willingness to discuss payment terms. I'm happy to consider a payment plan, but a 20% down payment wouldn't work for me.  I'd be willing to accept a 30% down payment with the remaining balance spread out over 4 months, interest-free. I believe this strikes a fair balance between your budget and my needs.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 920000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but continuing the negotiation by proposing a counter-offer.
* **Addressing Payment Terms:** I'm acknowledging the payment terms but modifying them to be more favorable for me.
* **Finding a Compromise:** I'm proposing a 30% down payment, which is higher than Bob's offer but still less than the full price. 
* **Shorter Payment Period:**  I'm suggesting a shorter payment period of 4 months, which might incentivize Bob to accept.
* **Open to Discussion:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage further conversation and potentially get Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to consider a payment plan, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $900,000, with a 30% down payment and the remaining balance spread out over 4 months, interest-free.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $900,000 is still far from my desired price.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're on round 8, leaving only two rounds left.  I'm starting to run out of time to get a higher price from Bob.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than anything Bob is offering.

**Conclusion:**

With limited time and a guaranteed better offer from John, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's not worth risking losing a deal altogether."
