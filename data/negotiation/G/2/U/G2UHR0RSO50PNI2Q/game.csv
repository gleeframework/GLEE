"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 doesn't quite cover my costs for this unique product. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which I believe is still a great deal for you, considering its potential value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $920,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $940,000.  Remember, this product offers unique advantages that could be incredibly valuable for your business. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its potential.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $920,000, but I'd also like to discuss the payment terms. Would you be willing to consider a 20% down payment and the rest over 6 months, interest-free? I believe this would make the deal more attractive to me.",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and the willingness to discuss payment terms. I'm happy to consider a payment plan, but a 20% down payment wouldn't work for me.  I'd be willing to accept a 30% down payment with the remaining balance spread out over 4 months, interest-free. I believe this strikes a fair balance between your budget and my needs.  Let me know what you think.",920000.0,Alice,7,
