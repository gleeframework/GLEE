"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $110, it's worth negotiating further to try and save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $105, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $110 and my maximum price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $108 is a good deal for me. It's within my budget and only slightly more than my initial counteroffer.  Since we're already in round 3, I'm not sure how much more I can negotiate, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
