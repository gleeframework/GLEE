"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would significantly enhance your endeavors and contribute greatly to your success. The product, which I am confident you will find invaluable, is currently valued by me at $1,200,000. This represents an exceptional investment, considering its worth to you is estimated at $1,500,000.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you are interested in proceeding with the purchase. I am more than happy to provide additional information or answer any questions you might have.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John for $1,500,000.  There's a significant price difference to negotiate within. By rejecting Alice's first offer, you create room to negotiate a potentially much better deal without the risk of immediately overpaying."
