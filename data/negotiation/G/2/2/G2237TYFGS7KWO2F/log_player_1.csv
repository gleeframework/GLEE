{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product name] that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking $15,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, knowing I can negotiate down.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** I'm using positive language to make the offer more appealing.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to make the price seem reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, showing I'm flexible.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Lower but Still Above Minimum:**  Bob's offer is below my initial price but still above my minimum acceptable value. This indicates potential for further negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's room to push for a price closer to my initial $15,000, especially if I believe Bob is truly interested.
* **Sell to John is a Backup:**  While I can sell to John for $10,000, I'm not immediately desperate to do so.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt to negotiate a higher price while keeping the possibility of selling to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. This reflects the product's quality and unique features. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial $15,000, but not going too low. 
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and unique features to support my asking price.
* **Seeking Agreement:** I'm explicitly suggesting we reach an agreement, signaling a willingness to negotiate but also setting a clear expectation.

This counteroffer aims to find a meeting point while still keeping my profit higher than what John would offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Meeting Point:** Bob's offer is very close to my previous counteroffer of $13,500. This suggests we're nearing a potential agreement.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject this offer and try to counteroffer again, I risk Bob walking away entirely.
* **Acceptable Profit:**  $12,500 is still significantly higher than my minimum of $10,000. This is a reasonable profit margin, especially considering the risk of losing the sale.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at a price that meets my minimum profit requirements while avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potential loss."
