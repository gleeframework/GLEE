{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also making it clear that I'm open to discussion and want to make a deal that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $12,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm willing to try and get closer to my desired price of $14,000.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? That's still a fantastic deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $12,500 for the product? This would allow me to acquire it without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's close enough to my desired price of $14,000, and it's still significantly higher than the $12,000 I could get from John. I'd rather secure the deal with Bob at this price than risk losing him and having to settle for less with John."
