"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can we meet in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8750? I'm sure you'll find it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $8750 is a bit too high. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can we discuss further?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $8000. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
