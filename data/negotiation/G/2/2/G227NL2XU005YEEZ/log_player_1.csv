"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting point, a reasonable offer considering the product's value to Bob and your own minimum.  We'll see how he responds and adjust accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is more than Bob initially offered, it's still significantly less than my minimum goal of $12,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? I'm sure you'll find it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8750 is a bit too high. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm running out of rounds, $7,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm confident I can push for a better price with a counteroffer, especially since I have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
