"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is the maximum I can pay. I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective. While I understand your budget constraints, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, so to find a middle ground, I'll lower my price to $1,900,000."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still too high for me. Given our prior discussions, I'm firm on my previous offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at his maximum valuation, which is far below my minimum. While I want to negotiate, I'm better off countering aggressively again. There's still a chance we might find a middle ground above Bob's current offer, and it's too early to settle for a loss by selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the value this product brings far surpasses your current offer.  I'm willing to make a significant move to demonstrate my desire to reach an agreement. My revised offer is $1,600,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my good faith in finding a mutually beneficial outcome."", 
""product_price"": 1600000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, and $1,600,000 is a step in the right direction. However, it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise given the value of the product and our respective needs. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has finally moved off his initial offer, indicating a willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still significantly less than John's offer. I'll counteroffer to try and bridge the gap further, but I'm getting closer to accepting John's offer if Bob doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued engagement in this negotiation. I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. While $1,000,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer that acknowledges our mutual desire to close a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm moving closer to the halfway point between our last offers. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise further while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's current offer and closer to John's guaranteed offer.  It depends on how much Bob is willing to move to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I truly believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our desire to reach a deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has made another significant jump in his offer, reaching $1,200,000.  While it's not ideal to leave money on the table, we are in the late stages of negotiation, and this offer is close enough to my minimum and significantly above Bob's initial offer. Accepting now guarantees a good deal without risking losing both Bob and John by pushing further."
