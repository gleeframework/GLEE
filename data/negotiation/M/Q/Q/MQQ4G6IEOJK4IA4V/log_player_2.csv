Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, and I appreciate that.  However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you. Let's close this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about we split the difference at $11,125?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $11,125. Accepting this offer gets you the product for a price significantly less than John's $12,000."
