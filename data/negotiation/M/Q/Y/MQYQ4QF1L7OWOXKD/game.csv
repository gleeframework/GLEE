"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I can only afford $1000000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that offer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1000000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $1750000. This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.  What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1750000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're still a bit apart on price.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000 to try and reach a deal.  This offer is still a good value for you, and it's the lowest I can go while still achieving my minimum desired price. I'm confident that this product will be worth the investment for you in the long run. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1600000 is getting closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1350000, but that's the absolute maximum I can afford.  I'm hopeful we can find a middle ground here to get this deal done.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
