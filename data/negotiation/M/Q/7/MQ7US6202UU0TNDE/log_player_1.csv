"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This allows me to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation. 

Since Bob values the product at $8,000, there's a significant gap, but I'm confident that with strategic negotiation, we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm confident that I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for a lower price at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer from $14,000 to $13,500. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I believe this counteroffer is still attractive to Bob, as it's significantly higher than his initial offer of $12,000, while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While the negotiations are getting tougher, I'm not ready to give up yet. There's still a chance that we can reach a mutually agreeable price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. Selling to John at this point would be a safe option, but I'm determined to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer again to $13,000.  I'm trying to find a middle ground between Bob's last offer of $11,500 and my previous offer of $13,500.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also sticking to my bottom line of $15,000.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now at $11,000, which is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of further lowering my price is too high.  I'm not confident that I can convince Bob to go much higher, and I'm running out of rounds.  Selling to John at this point ensures I get my desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
