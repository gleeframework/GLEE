"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Not Too Low:**  While we want to start low, offering something extremely low (like $20) might insult Alice and make her less willing to negotiate. $60 is a significant drop from her asking price but still demonstrates potential interest. 
* **Polite and Clear:** The message is polite and explains that while the initial price is too high, you are still interested in finding a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, my product is worth more than $60 to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $100 for it. How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's counteroffer of $90 is a significant improvement, it's still above your $80 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Her willingness to meet in the middle suggests there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:** It's good to keep John's $80 offer in mind as a fallback option, but it's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price, and I'm eager to get my hands on this product."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer ($90) and your previous offer ($60). This approach often feels reasonable to both parties in a negotiation.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Adding a phrase like ""I'm eager to get my hands on this product"" signals to Alice that you're motivated to make a deal, which might encourage her to accept. 
* **Staying Below Budget:**  Importantly, we remain below your $80 maximum price, preserving the possibility of walking away to John's offer if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested, Bob. However, $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $110 for it. How about we meet at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Unrealistic Counter:** Alice's counteroffer of $105 shows she's not willing to budge into a price range that works for you.  She's gone up from her previous offer, indicating she's not seriously negotiating.
* **Avoid Overpaying:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of getting stuck in a loop where she makes small concessions but never reaches a price you're comfortable with.
* **John's Guarantee:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John at $80. It's time to cut your losses with Alice and take the sure thing."
