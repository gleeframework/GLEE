"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away and potentially get the product for $1,500,000 from John. This gives you leverage to negotiate with Alice for a lower price."
