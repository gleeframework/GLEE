# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower than $800,000 to see if I can get a better deal."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $750,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.

While Alice is moving closer to my desired price point, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to $600,000."

Alice is clearly committed to a price above $650,000. I'll make one final counteroffer to try and secure a price closer to $650,000. If she rejects this, I'll buy from John to avoid further haggling."
