Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's always best to aim for the highest possible profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so I need to offer a price that's appealing but doesn't give away too much of my potential profit.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $14,999 feels like a significant discount compared to a round $15,000, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, since I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, it's worth the risk to see if I can secure a higher price."
