"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,500.  Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is too far below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $8,500 is still a little steep for me. How about $7,000? That's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll go down to $8,000.  This is my final offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
