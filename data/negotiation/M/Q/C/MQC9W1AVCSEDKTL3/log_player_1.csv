We're still significantly above John's offer, and there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can nudge Bob a bit higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  How about this - to show I'm serious about making a deal with you, I'll come down to $885,000. That's a substantial investment on my part, demonstrating my desire to see this product in your capable hands."",

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000

While we could push for more, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we're getting close to the point where the potential gain from further negotiation is outweighed by the risk of him walking away. Accepting $870,000 secures a significant profit over John's offer."
