Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to build interest and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not going all-in with the full $10,000 price, leaving space for potential counteroffers.
* **Backup option:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which serves as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the worth of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with another counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:** I know I can sell to John for $10,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value while still aiming for a price closer to my goal.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and encouraging a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,100. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $400 below my minimum acceptable price. This is a relatively small gap considering the potential for further negotiation.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I continue to reject, there's a chance Bob will walk away, leaving me with John's offer of $10,000, which is significantly less appealing than $9,100.
* **Time efficiency:** Accepting now saves time and effort compared to continuing negotiations, especially since the remaining price difference is minimal."
