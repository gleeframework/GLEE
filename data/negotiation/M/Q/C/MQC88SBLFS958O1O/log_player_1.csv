Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its worth to you. However, my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still have time and hope to maximize my earnings."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,380,000?  This is a significant investment for you, and I want to make sure we find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1380000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,360,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is very close. I'm concerned that if I reject it, he may walk away entirely, and I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. Accepting this offer ensures a good sale and keeps the negotiation going."
