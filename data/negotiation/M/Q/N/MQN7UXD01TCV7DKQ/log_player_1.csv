"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my profit.  
* $9,500 is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* I want to gauge Bob's initial reaction and see how willing he is to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. 
* Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate, indicating he values the product higher than $8,500.
* I'm not ready to sell to John yet as there's still room for a more profitable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still remaining above Bob's offer. 
* This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but not willing to accept his first counteroffer.
*  $9,000 is a compromise, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $8,750 is only $250 less than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
*  While I'd prefer a higher price, the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or Bob walking away entirely is high.
*  The deal with John would only net me $8,000.  
*  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit, given the limited rounds remaining."
