"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000). There's plenty of room for negotiation. It's better to reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less given the value of the product to me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects both of our interests.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product's value to me is quite significant, and $1,000,000 falls short of what I'd consider. I could agree to $1,200,000. This price reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a significant benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target price.  There's room for negotiation, and it's worthwhile to see if I can get a lower price."
