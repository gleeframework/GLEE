"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  How about $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $110. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $125. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, this is getting close. How about we split the difference and make it $117?",117.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $117. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $117, which would be $121. It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",121.0,Alice,7,
