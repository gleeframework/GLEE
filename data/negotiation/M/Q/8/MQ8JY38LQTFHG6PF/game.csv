"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This is a fair compromise for both of us and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
