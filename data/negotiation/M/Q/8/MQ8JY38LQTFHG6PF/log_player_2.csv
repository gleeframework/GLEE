"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's $10,000 limit.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly closer to his maximum price point but still leaves some room for negotiation. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying but also isn't willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $11,500 is still above Bob's target of $10,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further. There are still 7 rounds left, so Bob has time to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This is a fair compromise for both of us and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering a price that is halfway between his initial counteroffer and Alice's current offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to keep the price closer to his target. This approach could encourage Alice to accept the offer, as it represents a fair middle ground."
