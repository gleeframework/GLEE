"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still represents a good value for me, and I believe it's within Bob's budget considering the product's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still lower than I hoped for, it's a significant improvement over John's offer and gets me closer to my desired price. With only 6 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better offer from Bob."
