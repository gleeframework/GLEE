"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $130? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",145.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $145 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go higher than $135. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",135.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $142. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",142.0,Alice,5,
