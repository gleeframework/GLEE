I'm offering Bob the product for $1,450,000. This is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,425,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to settle for that low. I'll counter with a price in the middle ground between our last two offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a price that's closer to Bob's last offer but still ensures I make a decent profit. I'm hoping this will be enough to finally convince Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

It seems like we're at an impasse. While I'm still hoping for a higher price, Bob's offers keep decreasing, and the negotiations are becoming time-consuming. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,200,000. It's not ideal, but it guarantees I don't lose money and it's still above my minimum acceptable price."
