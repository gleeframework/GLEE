Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it is:

* **Above Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **Below your minimum:** This ensures you will make a profit if he accepts.
* **Not too high:** This keeps the negotiation process open and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you can potentially get closer to your target price of $120.  Remember,  you always have the option to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his valuation of $80, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and reach a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  This gives you a good deal, and I can still make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is still below my ideal price of $120, it is a reasonable compromise. It's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 than the previous offer of $85 and is within the negotiation range.  The benefit of accepting Bob's offer is the certainty of a sale. If I reject this offer, there is a chance that Bob will walk away, leaving me with the risk of having to sell to John at a lower price."
