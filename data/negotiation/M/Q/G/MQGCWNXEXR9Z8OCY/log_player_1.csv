Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $99."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring a sale.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $80. 
* **John as Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John if Bob refuses.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($99) creates a sense of urgency and a perceived deal for Bob.  It's a win-win if he accepts, as he gets it for more than he values it, and you get more than Bob's initial valuation."
