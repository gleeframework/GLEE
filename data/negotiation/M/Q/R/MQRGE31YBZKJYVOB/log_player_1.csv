Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think you'll find it very useful. How about $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can come up with a fair price of $150 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is his ceiling price, and he's unlikely to go any higher. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
