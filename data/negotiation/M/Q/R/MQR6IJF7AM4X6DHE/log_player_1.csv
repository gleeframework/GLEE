Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price.  I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, meaning he'd theoretically be willing to pay anything below that.
* **Your Minimum:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so you shouldn't accept anything lower.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price around $925,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value Bob sees while still leaving him with a potential profit margin.
* **Firm Offer:**  By presenting it as a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" offer, you create a sense of urgency and limit the potential for drawn-out negotiations. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob could reject the offer. This strategy aims to balance maximizing potential profit with the certainty of John's offer."
