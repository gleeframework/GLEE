"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high price ($2,000,000) sets a strong starting point and gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob (""considering the value it holds for you"") emphasizes his potential gain, making the offer more appealing.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and enthusiastic tone (""Let's make this happen!"") creates a friendly and cooperative atmosphere.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is intentionally high. It allows for flexibility in subsequent negotiations and positions me as the seller with the upper hand. I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I see the value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer considering his lower budget, I'm confident I can secure a better deal with him or John. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I'll use this round to gauge his willingness to negotiate and see if he's truly interested in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply not enough for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This price still gives you a significant value advantage, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Budget:**  Showing I understand his financial limitations builds trust and creates a more collaborative atmosphere. 
* **Offer a Compromise:** Presenting $1,200,000 as a ""middle ground"" implies I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm to a price significantly higher than his initial offer.
* **Highlight Value Advantage:**  Reiterating the value to Bob (""significant value advantage"") reinforces his potential gain, making the offer more appealing.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's. By offering a compromise, I'm testing his willingness to move closer to my desired price. If he rejects this offer, I'll be ready to either move closer to his price or turn to John if his offers continue to be too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, but that price is still a bit too high for me. How about $900,000? That's a substantial offer and shows I'm serious. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly lower. I'm not willing to sell for that price yet.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I want to see if Bob is truly serious about buying the product and if he's willing to move closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can secure a better deal, either with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a step in the right direction, but still falls short of what I need.  How about we meet in the middle again at $1,050,000?  This is a fair price that gives you a valuable asset and allows me to move forward with the sale.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Progress:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm receptive to his offers and acknowledge his movement towards my desired price.
* **Another Compromise:** I'm proposing a new ""middle ground"" price, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate further.
* **Focus on Mutual Gain:** I emphasize the benefits for both of us (""valuable asset"" for Bob, ""move forward with the sale"" for me), highlighting the positive outcome of reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is another step down from my previous offer, but I'm still holding firm to a price that's considerably higher than Bob's.  By offering a middle ground again, I'm putting the ball in Bob's court and testing his commitment to closing the deal.  If he rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess the situation and consider moving closer to his price or exploring the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $950,000 to make this deal happen. That's a very strong offer considering my initial budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly lower.  I'm not willing to sell for that price yet.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I want to see if Bob is truly serious about buying the product and if he's willing to move closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can secure a better deal, either with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to make this work. $950,000 is a good offer, but it's still a bit too far from my ideal price point.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to move forward with the sale. Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Effort:** I show appreciation for Bob's willingness to negotiate, building rapport and encouraging a positive atmosphere.
* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's current offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Focus on Value & Progress:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob while also emphasizing the benefits of closing the deal for both of us.
* **Call to Action:** I use a strong call to action (""Let's get this done!"") to encourage Bob to accept the offer and finalize the deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. By offering a middle ground and emphasizing the benefits of a deal, I'm putting pressure on Bob to close the deal. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is important to both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $975,000 to finalize this deal. That's a significant investment for me and shows how serious I am about acquiring this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell for that price yet.  

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  However, this is getting close to the wire.  I'm considering the option of selling to John as a backup plan, but I'll make one final counteroffer to Bob to see if I can secure a better deal.  If his final offer isn't significantly higher, I'll likely go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to invest.  While $975,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to make one final compromise to close this deal.  How about $990,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. It's a win-win situation. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm signaling this is my last offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Small Concession:**  The price is only slightly higher than Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to be flexible but still holding firm on a reasonable price.
* **Win-Win Focus:** I emphasize the mutual benefits of the deal (""win-win situation"") to motivate Bob to accept.
* **Strong Call to Action:**  The ""Let's make this happen!"" statement emphasizes the urgency of the situation and encourages Bob to close the deal.

**Strategy:**

This is a very risky move.  I'm very close to my minimum acceptable price, and if Bob rejects, I'll likely have to sell to John. However, I'm hoping the finality of this offer and the emphasis on a win-win scenario will persuade Bob to accept. If not, I'll be ready to move on to John in the final round."
