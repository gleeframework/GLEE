Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, though unlikely. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Asking for the full $120 might make Bob feel like he's not getting any deal and could lead to an immediate rejection. 

By starting at $119, Alice strikes a balance between maximizing her potential profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
