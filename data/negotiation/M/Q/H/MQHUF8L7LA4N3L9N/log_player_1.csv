Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $10,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely to get a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""value and potential"") makes the offer feel less arbitrary. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation instead of just saying yes or no.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects it, Alice can always lower the price, especially knowing John provides a fallback option at $8,000."
