Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $19,000. I believe this product would be very valuable to you, even more so than the base value it provides.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Gauging Interest:**  A high initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Potential for Profit:** If Bob accepts the $19,000 offer, you make a significant profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always lower the price closer to his perceived value ($10,000) while still staying above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have the time and resources to potentially negotiate with Bob. If you need to sell the product quickly, a price closer to John's offer might be more practical."
