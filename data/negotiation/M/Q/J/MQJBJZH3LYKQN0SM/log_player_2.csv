"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,500,000 is more than his budget and he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. It's better to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to lower her price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1250000. What do you think?

While $1,250,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what John is offering.  Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1200000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let me know.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice has made her final offer at $1,200,000, which is still higher than John's price of $1,000,000.  There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
