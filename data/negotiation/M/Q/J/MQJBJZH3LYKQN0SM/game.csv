"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in purchasing if we can get closer to $1000000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1250000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to purchase. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1200000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let me know.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
