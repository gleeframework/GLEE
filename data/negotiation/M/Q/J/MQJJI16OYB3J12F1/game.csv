"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the gap between $900,000 and my valuation is quite significant.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,000,000 for this unique product?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to increase my offer to $950,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on this. Let's make this the final offer, $975,000.  This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",975000.0,Alice,5,
