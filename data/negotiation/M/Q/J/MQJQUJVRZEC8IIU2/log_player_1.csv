Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, we'll see if he's serious about buying and what price he's willing to offer. I'm prepared to negotiate, but I won't let him walk away with a steal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer Bob to see if he's willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering him a price that's still a good profit for me, but lower than my initial ask. Hopefully, this shows I'm willing to negotiate and encourages him to come up on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to get the best price possible, it's not worth risking a longer negotiation with him.  John is a sure thing at $800,000, which is my minimum.  I'll take the deal with John."
