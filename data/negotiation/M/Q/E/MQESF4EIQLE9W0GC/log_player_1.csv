I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still significantly exceeding my minimum desired price of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is still well above my minimum acceptable price, but it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price."

I'm lowering the price again to $1,150,000. This is a compromise that hopefully shows my willingness to meet Bob halfway, while still ensuring a decent profit."
