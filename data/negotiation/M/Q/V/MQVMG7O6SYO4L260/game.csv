"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,350,000. This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,175,000, which is a fair compromise.  I'm confident this is a price that we can both agree on.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,175,000 is still below its true value.  I propose $1,275,000 as my final offer. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and ensures you're getting a fair deal on a truly valuable product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,275,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000, which is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget. This is my final offer.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
