"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is a bit outside my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $12000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is a fair price, taking into account the product's worth and my initial offer. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12000.  If that's not acceptable, I'll need to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $12000 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and our previous discussions. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still a bit hesitant at $14000.  If you're willing to come down to $13000, I'm ready to make a deal.  Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
