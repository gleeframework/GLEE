Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $13,000 is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** Emphasizing that it's a ""great deal"" for both of us can help create a more positive negotiation environment. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message implies I'm open to negotiation, which encourages Bob to counter-offer. 

**Next steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and decide whether to counter-offer, accept his offer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value gap:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 below my initial offer. This suggests he's serious about buying and willing to negotiate.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even if I reject his offer, there's a good chance we can reach a compromise in the next round.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $10,000 would mean leaving $2,500 on the table, which is a significant amount. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer is the most profitable option at this stage, given his counteroffer is close to my initial price and selling to John would result in a lower profit."
