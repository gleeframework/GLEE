Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Offering the product at $115 is a reasonable markup from Bob's perceived value ($100) while still being below your guaranteed price. 
* **""Special Offer"" Framing:**  By presenting it as a ""special price,"" you create a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
 
This strategy aims to get you the highest possible price without losing Bob as a buyer."
