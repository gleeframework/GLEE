"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering me this unique item. However, $18000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $12000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I'm hopeful we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. It's still a great deal, considering the value and uniqueness of the item. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's really my limit. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're close to your limit, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $15500. It's a fair price considering the value of the item, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $15500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go up to $15000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. ",15000.0,Bob,6,
