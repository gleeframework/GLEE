"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,000,000 is my absolute limit.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I could get it elsewhere for the same price. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're close to your limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
