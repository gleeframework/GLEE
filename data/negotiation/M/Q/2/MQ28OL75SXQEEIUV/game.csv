"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable asset. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a reasonable price for the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is sufficient for this product. Considering the value it brings to the table, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. I'm thinking of a price of $975,000. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Alice,5,
