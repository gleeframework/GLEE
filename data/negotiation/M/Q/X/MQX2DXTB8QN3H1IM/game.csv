"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I can meet the price you're asking. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective,  $1,600,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I believe $1,650,000 is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,580,000. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1580000.0,Bob,4,
