,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $160. Can you consider that?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $160 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $145 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see you're serious about getting a good price, so I'm willing to make a small concession. I can do $155, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but $155 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product, which is the same price I could get from John. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",150.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already mentioned that I can sell the product to John for $150, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make one final offer to you, but I need to make a profit. I can do $157.50. That's as low as I can go.",157.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you $150, and you've rejected it. I'm not willing to pay more than that. I'm going to have to consider buying the product from John for $150.",150.0,Bob,8,
