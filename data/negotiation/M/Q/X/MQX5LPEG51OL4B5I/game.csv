"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference at $8,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us both closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,3,
