# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice. You can likely get it for less than $1,100,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000.  This price reflects the value you've placed on the product while still being fair to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is a good price, considering John is selling it for $1,000,000. It's a good deal to get it for a little bit more, without risking losing the deal."
