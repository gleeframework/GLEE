"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Could we work something out closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,5,
