Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This maximizes my potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer in a positive light, highlighting the value for Bob. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counter, encouraging negotiation. 

**Important Note:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John open. This provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $965,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer is very close to my desired price of $965,000.
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of losing the deal to John becomes higher. 
* **Possible Counteroffer:**  I could counter with $963,750, but there's no guarantee Bob will accept. There's a risk that we'll end up stuck at an impasse. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I secure a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
