Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,200,000, Alice wants to get as close to that amount as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product for $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, but Alice knows she has a secure offer from John if Bob declines.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning that the product will be offered to others, Alice creates a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
