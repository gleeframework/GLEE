"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, and $1100000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that we're already close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm not willing to go below $1200000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm going to make one more counteroffer, and then I'll need to consider other options.
