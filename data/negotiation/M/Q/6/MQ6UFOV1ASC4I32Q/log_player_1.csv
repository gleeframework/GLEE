"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 
 
This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially a profit for both parties. This allows for a starting point that is not overly aggressive and opens the possibility for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a fair price considering the value to you, and it gives us both room for profit.  Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product holds value, but $1,250,000 is still too far from what I have in mind. I can do $950,000.  That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll continue to counter with a higher offer. I have several rounds left, and I don't want to settle for an offer that doesn't meet my needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're making an effort, but $950,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it's the most I'm willing to spend. It's a fair deal for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and there are only a few rounds left.  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price."
