"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a fair price considering the value to you, and it gives us both room for profit.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product holds value, but $1,250,000 is still too far from what I have in mind. I can do $950,000.  That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making an effort, but $950,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it's the most I'm willing to spend. It's a fair deal for both of us. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,
