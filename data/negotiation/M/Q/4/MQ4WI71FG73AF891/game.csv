"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a fair deal. Could you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $9,000 is still stretching my budget.  I'd be willing to go up to $7,500, but that's my absolute limit.",7500.0,Bob,6,
