"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm asking for $13,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is much higher than both your budget and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a low number first, we're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  We don't want to start too close to our maximum budget ($8,000) just yet. This gives us space to make concessions as the negotiation progresses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a fair deal. Could you consider $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice came down in price, but it's still significantly above our budget and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  We need to signal that we're serious about a lower price without stalling the negotiation entirely. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** We're increasing our offer by $1,000, showing Alice that we're willing to move closer to her price range. 
* **Approaching Limit:** We're getting closer to our $8,000 limit, but leaving a small buffer for a potential final concession.
* **Seeking a Compromise:**  The $7,000 offer is a compromise, aiming for a price that's more palatable to Alice while staying within a reasonable range for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's offer is still $1,000 above our maximum budget.
* **John's Offer:** We have a standing offer from John for $8,000, making Alice's current offer less appealing. 
* **Pressure on Alice:** We're running out of rounds, which puts pressure on Alice to come down further if she wants to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $9,000 is still stretching my budget.  I'd be willing to go up to $7,500, but that's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Counter:** We're making a smaller increase this time ($500), signaling that we're reaching our upper limit.
* **Setting a Boundary:** Clearly stating ""$7,500 is my absolute limit"" reinforces our position and puts the decision back on Alice. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, Alice needs to decide if she's willing to accept a lower price or risk losing the sale."
