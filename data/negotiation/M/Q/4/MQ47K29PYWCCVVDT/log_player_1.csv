Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, I want to secure a price that's significantly higher. However, I'm aware that Bob values it less, so I'm leaving room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'm prepared to counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise. I also have the option of selling to John, who is willing to pay my minimum value.  This gives me a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. My goal is to reach a price closer to my initial offer of $1,750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a significant profit.  $1,600,000 is a good compromise point, demonstrating flexibility while still exceeding my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable counteroffer and be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively lower, and I'm not confident that I can get a significantly higher price from him.  While I would prefer to sell for more, it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my expectations.  Therefore, I'm going to accept John's offer to sell the product for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
