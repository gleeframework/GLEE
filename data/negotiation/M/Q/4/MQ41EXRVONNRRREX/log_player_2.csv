"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It is far too high.  He has a much better deal with John, so rejecting Alice's offer and continuing negotiations makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is far above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway at $13,500? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down in price, $13,500 is still too high for Bob. He's determined to get the product for under $8,000, and  John is still a viable option.  Continuing negotiations with Alice is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However,  $13,500 remains beyond my budget. I'm confident that $9,500 is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs. This offer demonstrates my serious interest in the product, but I can't go higher."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $9,500 is too low.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though it's a big drop in price, it's still above his budget. He can still get the product from John for $8,000. There's a good chance that Alice will counter with a lower price in the next round, and he's likely to be able to secure a better deal if he keeps negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  Considering our previous discussions, I'm convinced that $10,000 is a fair compromise. This price reflects the value of the product to me while allowing you to get a reasonable return. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
