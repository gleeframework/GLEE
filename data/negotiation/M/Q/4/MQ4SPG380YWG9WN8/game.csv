"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $1,200,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
