,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $11,000.  How about $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'd be happy with the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to offer $9,800, which is a bit lower than your previous offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get as close to the $10,000 mark as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to offer $9,900. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",9900.0,Bob,6,
