Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $9,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still secures a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Guarantee:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. This means Alice shouldn't accept anything less than $8,000 from Bob."
