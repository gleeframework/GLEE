Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is below my minimum, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $10500. How about we meet in the middle at $10250? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $10,250 is a good price, and I'm happy to close the deal.  It's a better outcome than selling to John for $10,000."
