Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than his perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to gauge his interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $12,000. While it's closer to my minimum value of $15,000, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than his counteroffer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $15,000. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of further price reductions is too high. Selling to John guarantees me my desired value, and I'm confident I won't find a better offer."
