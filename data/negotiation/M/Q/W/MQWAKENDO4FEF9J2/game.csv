,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is just a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is the highest I can go, so let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. If this doesn't work for you, I may have to consider other offers.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer of $925,000. This is the absolute highest I can go, and I'm starting to get concerned that I might need to consider buying from John if we can't come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
