"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for $900,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $825,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. If you're willing to meet me at this point, I'm willing to sell the product to you. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
