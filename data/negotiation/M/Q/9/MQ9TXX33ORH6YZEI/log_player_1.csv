Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counter-offers. 
* **Justification:**  While I don't explicitly state why my price is higher than Bob's perceived value, the phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies there might be aspects Bob isn't fully considering.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** I know John will buy the product for $12,000 if Bob refuses, guaranteeing I won't be stuck with the product. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a chance to purchase the product."
