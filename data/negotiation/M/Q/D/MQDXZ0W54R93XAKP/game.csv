"Alice, your offer is still too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget only allows me to spend up to $800,000. I'm willing to pay that amount if you're open to negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my offer of $800,000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll need to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
