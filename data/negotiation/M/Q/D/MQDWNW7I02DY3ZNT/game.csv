"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $400,000.",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $400,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still far too high for me. Let's try to be a little more realistic - how about $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to consider $1,300,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
