"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! While I agree it's a great product, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $16,000? That would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
