Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm starting significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and my minimum ($1,200,000). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to $1,600,000.
* **Leaving John as Backup:** I know I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, so I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, but not desperate enough to go below my minimum.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will give me insight into Bob's level of interest and potential counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is above his perceived value but still below my minimum. I know I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,200,000.  I'll counter-offer to see if I can meet Bob somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,600,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Move but Above Minimum:** I'm significantly lowering my initial asking price to show flexibility but staying above my $1,200,000 minimum (John's offer).
* **Targeting Above Bob's Offer:** I'm aiming for a price above Bob's $1,100,000 offer, hoping he might be willing to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Maintaining Confidence:**  The language still conveys confidence in the product's value, which might encourage Bob to stretch his budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,350,000, but I'm still not quite there. How about $1,250,000?  This feels more in line with the value we've both discussed and would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 (John's offer). 
* **Strong Negotiation by Bob:**  Bob has consistently negotiated well and seems unlikely to go much higher. 
* **Securing a Profit:** Accepting this offer secures a $50,000 profit compared to John's offer, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially breaking down."
