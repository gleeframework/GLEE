"Alice, $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,600,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,350,000, but I'm still not quite there. How about $1,250,000?  This feels more in line with the value we've both discussed and would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
