Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate and potentially meet you somewhere in the middle, still netting you a profit beyond your minimum.
* **Justifying the price:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" without revealing specifics, aiming to pique Bob's interest and potentially justify the high price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while also gauging Bob's interest and potential for a successful negotiation."
