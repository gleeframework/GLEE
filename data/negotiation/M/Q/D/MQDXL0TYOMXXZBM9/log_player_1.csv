"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get as close to my desired $100 as possible. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable negotiating. 
* **Value Proposition:**  While I don't specify details, I'm hinting that the product is valuable to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can offer you $95 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum ($100), but it's still below what I'd like to get. 
* **Negotiation:** I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to take a lower price, but not that low yet. 
* **Counteroffer:**  I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to go down to $105 for the product. Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is a compromise, reducing the price but still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive to maintain a good rapport with Bob.
* **Compromise:** I'm signaling that I'm open to a deal, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to offer $100 for the product. I hope this meets within your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is exactly my minimum price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price from another buyer, there's no guarantee.  The time spent negotiating with them could be wasted.
* **Closing the Deal:**  It's better to secure a guaranteed deal now rather than risk losing a sale with John or potentially getting stuck with a lower price later."
