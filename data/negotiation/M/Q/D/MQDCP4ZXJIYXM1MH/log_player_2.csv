# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?
