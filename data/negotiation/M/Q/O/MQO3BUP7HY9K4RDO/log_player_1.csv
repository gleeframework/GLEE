{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $8,000 is too far below my minimum price of $12,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While I'm still hoping to get a better price than $12,000,  it's getting late in the negotiations and I don't want to risk losing out completely.  I'm going to sell to John and guarantee myself my minimum price."
