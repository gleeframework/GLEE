"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The goal is to save money.  $15,000 is significantly more than the $10,000 threshold.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

Starting with a low offer of $8,000 is a good strategy. This shows Alice you are serious about negotiating and willing to pay less than her initial price. This is likely to start a negotiation process, and we can adjust the offer based on Alice's response in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is closer to our target, it's still above our maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate.  We have a good chance of getting closer to our goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

We're increasing our offer slightly to $9,500. This shows Alice we're willing to compromise while staying within our budget. It's a reasonable increase that might convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a good price, we're still within our budget and only have 5 rounds remaining.  There's still room for negotiation to try and get a lower price. We can continue to bargain with Alice and see if we can bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

We're getting closer to our budget limit, so we need to raise our offer. However, we're still below Alice's current offer of $12,000.  A counteroffer of $10,500 shows Alice we're serious about buying but still want a better deal. This is a calculated risk - Alice may reject it, but if she accepts, we've secured a good price."
