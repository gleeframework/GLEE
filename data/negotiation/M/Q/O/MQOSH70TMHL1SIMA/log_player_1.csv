Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high but is still below Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation if needed, but also allows me to potentially secure a higher profit than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum threshold of $120. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in a lower price. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
