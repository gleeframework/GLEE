# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to your business.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While I recognize you see the value in this product, $800,000 significantly undervalues its true potential and the returns it can generate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we consider $1,400,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It seems we're getting closer.  While $1,100,000 is still below my ideal price point, I understand the need to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try this â€“  $1,250,000, and I won't go any lower. I believe that figure reflects the true value of what's being offered.  What do you think?
