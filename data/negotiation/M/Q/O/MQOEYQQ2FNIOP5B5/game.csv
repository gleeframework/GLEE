"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make a serious offer. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While I recognize you see the value in this product, $800,000 significantly undervalues its true potential and the returns it can generate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we consider $1,400,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's as high as I'm comfortable going. Can you consider that?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It seems we're getting closer.  While $1,100,000 is still below my ideal price point, I understand the need to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try this â€“  $1,250,000, and I won't go any lower. I believe that figure reflects the true value of what's being offered.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
