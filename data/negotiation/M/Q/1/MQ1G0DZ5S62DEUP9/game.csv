"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $15,000. How about we try $12,500? It's a fair compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000.  Would you be open to that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we try $12,000? It's a fair price that's closer to your target, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
