"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to you is $1,500,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000?  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,050,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue working towards that.  $1,050,000 is still a bit below my acceptable price point.  To show my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that considers the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
