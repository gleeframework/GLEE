Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for $800,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible.
