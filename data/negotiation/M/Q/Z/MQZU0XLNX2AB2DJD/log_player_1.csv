"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This should encourage him to counteroffer and hopefully lead to a deal closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I want to see if I can push Bob higher.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  This should show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, while also keeping the potential profit high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer to get more, accepting now ensures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations falling through.  I also have to consider that I'm getting closer to the end of the allotted rounds."
