"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're highlighting, but $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire it while leaving you with a solid profit margin. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $9,000? This reflects the product's true value while still giving you a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $8,750? This would be a fair price, considering the value we've both discussed. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
