"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to make a fair offer, and I think that's a reasonable price considering the market value.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $130. I'm willing to go up to $115, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can we meet in the middle again?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above $115. How about we try to find a compromise again? I'm willing to go down to $125, but I think that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there?",125.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're close, Alice, but I'm still a bit away from $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $122.50. Can we shake on it?",122.5,Bob,6,

"I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit above $122.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can only go down to $123.50. Can you meet me there?",123.5,Alice,7,
