Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""significant benefit,"" the message subtly anchors the value for Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high asking price and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
