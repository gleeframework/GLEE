"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is higher. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

Bob should start with a significant counteroffer, showing Alice that he's serious about getting a better price.  $750,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to Bob's maximum price. It's a good deal, and there's no guarantee of a better offer in the future rounds. It's best to accept and secure the product at a price he's comfortable with."
