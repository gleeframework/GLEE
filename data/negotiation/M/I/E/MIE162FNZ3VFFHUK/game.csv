"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $850,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to settle at that price. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, my minimum price. This is a fair offer considering the value of the product and the potential for a long-term relationship. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $800,000, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our negotiation so far. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
