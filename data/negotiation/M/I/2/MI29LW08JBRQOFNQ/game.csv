"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $2,000,000. I'd be willing to consider a price of $1,400,000. Can you meet me at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?  This product has immense potential, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1,700,000 is the right price for this product. I'd be willing to pay $1,500,000, which is my maximum budget. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
