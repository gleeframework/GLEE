"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal than $12000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I have to say that $9000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $11000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your new offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $9500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'd like to propose a price of $10800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,5,
