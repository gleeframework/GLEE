Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" you subtly remind Bob that the product is desirable and worth a significant amount. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and keeps the conversation going.

While you have a guaranteed sale with John at $8,000, there's a chance to get a better price from Bob with a well-structured offer."
