"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $100 for the product.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my original offer.  How about $175? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little room to work with.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $175 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $125, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $150? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this deal happen!",150.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $150 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $135.  This is my final offer.  What do you think?",135.0,Bob,6,
