{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are trying to save as much money as possible. Since Alice is offering $9,500 and you value the product at $10,000, you have room to negotiate. You should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $9,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a compromise at $9,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

You can still potentially get a better deal.  Reject and see if you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to be fair, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,125. I'll make a new offer that's closer to my minimum price. How about we try $9,200? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down a bit, but not much. At this point, you've only got 5 rounds left, and the price from John is looming. It's a good deal, and you can get this done with a few rounds left."
