"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $9,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a compromise at $9,250. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to be fair, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,125. I'll make a new offer that's closer to my minimum price. How about we try $9,200? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",9200.0,Alice,5,
