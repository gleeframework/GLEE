"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your asking price is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12,000 for the product. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while staying within a reasonable price range.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to offer $8,000 for the product. That's my final offer, as it represents the very top of my budget.  I think this would be a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one more time. I can offer you the product for $10,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,7,
