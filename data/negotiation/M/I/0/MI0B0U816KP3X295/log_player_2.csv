"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $20,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to negotiate a much lower price, closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your asking price is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** My initial offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This establishes a strong negotiating position and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Respectful:**  Even though the offer is low, maintaining a courteous tone is important for a positive negotiation process.
* **Clear Budget Constraint:**  By stating my budget limitation indirectly, I'm signaling to Alice that I'm serious about purchasing but need a price that works for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12,000 for the product. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to a reasonable price, $12,000 is still significantly higher than both my budget and John's offer.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can get Alice closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while staying within a reasonable price range."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm incrementally increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Budget Emphasis:** Re-emphasizing my budget limitations keeps it at the forefront of the negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and appreciative tone encourages Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close! Alice is now within a reasonable range, but it's still worth trying to negotiate a slightly better deal before settling.  Getting her down another $1,000 would be ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to offer $8,000 for the product. That's my final offer, as it represents the very top of my budget.  I think this would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm presenting this as my best and final offer to signal that I'm serious and won't go higher. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning it's the top of my budget, I'm providing a reason for my position without revealing my ability to buy from John. 
* **Urgency:** This helps create a sense of urgency for Alice to accept, as I'm clearly willing to walk away if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one more time. I can offer you the product for $10,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to meet my maximum price, and it seems unlikely she'll go any lower. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $8,000. This ensures I get the product at the best possible price without further negotiation risk."
