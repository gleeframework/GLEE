"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is just slightly above your maximum price.** This suggests she's trying to push for a quick deal. 
* **You have 9 more rounds to negotiate.** There's potential to get a better deal, especially if Alice is eager to sell. 
* **Buying from John guarantees you the product at your limit.**  However, there's a chance you can get it for less by continuing negotiations.

**Strategy:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door to counteroffers.  This forces Alice to compromise if she wants to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your willingness to negotiate but also demonstrating that you're serious about buying.
* **Room for compromise:** This leaves room for further negotiation, potentially landing on a price around $1,150,000, which would be a good deal for both of you.
* **Time pressure:** With 9 rounds remaining, this counteroffer puts pressure on Alice to respond quickly. 

**Strategy:**  By offering a significantly lower price, you force Alice to consider your offer seriously. This creates a stronger negotiation dynamic and puts you in a more favorable position as the rounds progress."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has lowered her price significantly.** This shows she's willing to compromise and make a deal.
* **The price is within your acceptable range.**  You're getting a decent deal, saving $50,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While you could try to get a lower price, there's a risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and the deal falling apart.

**Strategy:**  It's better to secure the product now at a good price than risk further negotiation that might not yield a better outcome."
