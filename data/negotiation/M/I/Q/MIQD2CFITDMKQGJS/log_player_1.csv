"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This establishes a high anchor and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me gauge Bob's enthusiasm and willingness to negotiate.  His response will reveal how far apart our valuations are and how aggressively I need to proceed.
* **John as Backup:**  I have the security of selling to John for my minimum price. This allows me to be firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while still giving me a great deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is better than his perceived value, indicating there's room for negotiation. While I could secure a profit by accepting, I'm confident I can push for a higher price closer to my minimum.  I'm willing to leverage my fallback option (selling to John) to aim for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential and uniqueness of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and signal I'm moving towards a realistic price.
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm not drastically dropping the price.  I'm still aiming for a figure significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the ""true potential and uniqueness"" I'm reiterating the product's value and justifying the higher price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's flexibility. If he's unwilling to budge significantly from his $1,300,000, I may consider accepting his next offer or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get the best price possible, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. My budget simply won't allow for it. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price that takes into account both our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer! Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, but we're still $100,000 away from my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's still room to negotiate further. By rejecting his offer now, I signal that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my target.  We're getting into the later rounds, so I need to apply a bit more pressure to see if he's willing to move closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, and I acknowledge we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. Considering the value this product brings, I'm comfortable meeting you halfway between our last two offers. Let's settle this at $1,600,000."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I'm starting with a positive note, acknowledging Bob's efforts and our progress, aiming for a collaborative rather than adversarial negotiation.
* **Strategic Compromise:** By suggesting a price exactly halfway, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still holding firm above my absolute minimum. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  We are past the halfway point of the rounds, which adds subtle pressure for a decision.  By ""settling"" now, I imply it's a fair and final offer without explicitly stating it. 
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:** While this is my ideal price, there's a slight buffer below to my absolute minimum in case Bob pushes back minimally one last time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  To close the deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk he'll walk away.  It's better to secure a guaranteed profit now than risk losing the deal and having to settle for the same price with John."
