"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while still giving me a great deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential and uniqueness of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get the best price possible, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. My budget simply won't allow for it. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price that takes into account both our needs.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, and I acknowledge we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. Considering the value this product brings, I'm comfortable meeting you halfway between our last two offers. Let's settle this at $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  To close the deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
