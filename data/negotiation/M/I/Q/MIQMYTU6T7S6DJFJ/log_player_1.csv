{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a bit below my minimum price of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price is high enough to be attractive to Bob, but also gives me space to negotiate up if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'm not willing to go above that. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $9,000 is significantly less than my minimum price of $15,000, and even less than the $12,000 I offered him initially. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let me know if this price works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm not confident we can reach a better price with Bob, and I don't want to risk losing out on the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
