"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'm not willing to go above that. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let me know if this price works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10000.0,Bob,4,
