Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price of $12,000 allows for potential counteroffers without me dropping below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  I've secured a good price and achieved my goal.
* If Bob rejects:  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing further negotiation, or if I should sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only able to pay up to $9,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better counteroffer:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Negotiating for the best outcome:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and attempt to secure a higher price. 

**Next Step:** 

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $9,500 is still below my acceptable range.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price that's higher than my minimum acceptable value.
* **Finding Common Ground:** This counteroffer shows that I'm flexible and open to finding a compromise.
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:**  I'm still using a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  I've achieved a good price, exceeding my initial offer.
* If Bob rejects:  I'll need to assess the situation and consider:
    * **Bob's counteroffer:** Is it close enough to my minimum value that it's worth accepting?
    * **Selling to John:** Is the risk of Bob rejecting my offer too high, making it more advantageous to sell to John for $15,000?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still unable to meet at $11,000. I would like to propose $10,000 as a compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while keeping within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is close to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to further rejection from Bob, potentially resulting in me having to sell to John for $15,000.
* **Time and Effort:**  It's likely that further negotiations will be time-consuming and require more effort.

**Decision:**

Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale that is close to my minimum acceptable value, minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potentially achieving a better outcome than selling to John."
