"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $9,500 is still below my acceptable range.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still unable to meet at $11,000. I would like to propose $10,000 as a compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while keeping within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
