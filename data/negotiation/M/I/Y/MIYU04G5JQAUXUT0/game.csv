"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there though.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable meeting you at $1,150,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
