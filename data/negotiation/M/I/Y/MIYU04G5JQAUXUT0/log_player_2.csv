"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $1,200,000 is still too high.  Let's see if we can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. What do you think?

Alice's counteroffer is closer, but still too high. It's worth another attempt to negotiate. Let's see if we can find a compromise."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable meeting you at $1,150,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. At this point, it's probably better to just buy from John for $1,500,000.  Further negotiation with Alice might not result in a better price, and it's taking too much time."
