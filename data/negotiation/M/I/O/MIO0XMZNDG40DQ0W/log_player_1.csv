"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation but still significantly above your minimum.  It shows you value the product and are confident in its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your ideal selling point.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.  You're still well above your minimum value, making it advantageous to keep trying for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still staying firm on your desired price. It's a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now at the price point you initially proposed in round 1.  There's no guarantee he'll increase his offer further, and the risk of further negotiation could lead to him walking away.  Accepting this offer ensures a solid profit and avoids the potential of ending up with John's lower offer."
