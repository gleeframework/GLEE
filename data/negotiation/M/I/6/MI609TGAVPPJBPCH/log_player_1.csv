Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $950,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize the ""great deal"" for both of us to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and encourage him to negotiate.
* **Flexibility:**  This price leaves me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Backup Plan:** I know I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I am only willing to pay up to $850,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob claims it's his final offer, I can likely push him higher with a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer:**  I have a safety net in John's offer of $1,000,000, giving me the freedom to negotiate aggressively with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this work. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $900,000 shows willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value of the product to emphasize the fairness of my offer.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I suggest ""meeting in the middle"" to make the offer seem like a reasonable compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation going and avoid a breakdown.

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer. If not, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe we can find a better solution. I would like to propose a price of $875,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle of our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, so there's no reason to settle for a lower price with Bob.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I can likely push Bob higher with another counteroffer.

**Next Steps:** I'll make one more counteroffer, trying to meet in the middle and push Bob closer to my desired price. If he rejects, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's the last offer I can make.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to move forward with another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm presenting this as my final offer to increase pressure on Bob.
* **Compromise:** I'm reducing my price slightly, showing willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative buyer:**  Mentioning another buyer increases the pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Clear ultimatum:**  I'm explicitly stating that this is my last offer to make it clear that if he doesn't accept, I will move on.

**Next Steps:** This is my last chance to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,000,000."
