Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. It's also significantly higher than my minimum value, allowing for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a higher counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000, my minimum acceptable price. This is still significantly higher than his offer, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid selling to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's not worth continuing to negotiate. I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation."
