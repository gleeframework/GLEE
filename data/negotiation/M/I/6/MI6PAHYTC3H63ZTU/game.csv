"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any higher than $1095000. I've already made significant concessions to try to reach an agreement. I'm afraid I must decline your latest offer. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to a mutually acceptable price. If you're willing to meet me at $1095000, I'm willing to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll consider selling the product to John for $1200000.",1095000.0,Alice,9,
