Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $140, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired outcome. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions willingness to negotiate, signaling to Bob that there's flexibility in the price.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:** The offer is above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still below your guaranteed sale price to John ($120). This creates a potential win-win situation where Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than he values it, while you still make a profit above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, reject it outright, or try to negotiate a much lower price. You'll need to be prepared to respond strategically based on his actions."
