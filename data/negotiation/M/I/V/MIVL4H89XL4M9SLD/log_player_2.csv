It's far too early to buy from Alice at that price.  You can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Alice's initial offer is very high. This counteroffer is a significant drop, signaling that you're serious about buying, but  are also willing to walk away if the price isn't right. It's a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice has come down in price, but $450,000 is still a bit too high.  There's room for further negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better deal."

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from your previous offer. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still remaining within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $400,000 is still a significant chunk of your budget, it's a reasonable price considering the potential for further negotiation is getting slimmer.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is a much worse deal.  It's time to close this deal and save a lot of money."
