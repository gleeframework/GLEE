``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than her product's worth to her ($800,000), it's still lower than John's price of $1,000,000. 
* **Saving money is the goal:** As Bob, the goal is to save as much money as possible. Accepting Alice's offer means saving $50,000 compared to buying from John."
