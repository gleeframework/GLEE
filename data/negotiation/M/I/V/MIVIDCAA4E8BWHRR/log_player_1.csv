Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $995,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 995000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, your goal is to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price just below your guaranteed sale price ($995,000) sets a strong anchor. 
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to decide quickly. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and that you ""believe it holds significant value"" subtly justifies the high price.

This strategy aims to capitalize on Bob's potential desire for the product while maximizing your profit beyond the guaranteed sale."
