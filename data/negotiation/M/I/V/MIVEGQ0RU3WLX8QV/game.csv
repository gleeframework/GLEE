"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it would greatly benefit you. Given its value, I propose a price of $12,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to discuss other options.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I propose a price of $10,750. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This price reflects the value of the product to me while also allowing you to make a profit.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After considering your proposal, I would like to suggest a price of $10,500 for the product. This is a compromise between our initial offers and aims to ensure both parties are satisfied with the transaction.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm still not quite there with $10,500. Let's see if we can split the difference at $10,375.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",10375.0,Bob,6,
