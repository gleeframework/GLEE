Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. This is my maximum offer, as I can acquire a similar product from John for that price.  What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1800000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to sell it for $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still above my budget. My maximum offer remains $800000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to purchase from John.",800000.0,Bob,4,
