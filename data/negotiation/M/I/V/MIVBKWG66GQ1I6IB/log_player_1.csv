Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Value:** I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so that's my baseline.
* **Potential Gain:** By offering $1,500,000, I have the potential to earn an additional $500,000.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  If Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. This allows me to take a calculated risk.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with minimizing risk.  However, there are other factors to consider, such as:

* **Bob's Perceived Value:**  If I believe Bob might value the product significantly higher than $1,500,000, I could potentially offer a higher price. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I could offer a slightly lower price, say $1,250,000, to leave room for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a better deal.

Ultimately, the best offer depends on my assessment of Bob's potential value and my willingness to take risks."
