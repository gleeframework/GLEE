"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a great deal.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
