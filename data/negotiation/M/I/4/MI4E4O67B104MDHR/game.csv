"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,100,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,250,000.  Would that be feasible?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you getting closer to my desired price, but I need to be sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell the product for $1,425,000. This leaves us both with a good outcome. What do you say?",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  To be honest, my absolute limit is $1,300,000. If you can do that, we have a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,300,000 is close, it's still below what I need to make this deal work. To make this happen, I'm willing to go down to $1,375,000.  It's a small compromise on my part, and it brings us closer to a deal. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,7,
