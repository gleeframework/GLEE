"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  $140 is still above Bob's maximum value of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still below his maximum value but is closer to Alice's minimum value. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation and increases the chance of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum value. While it's closer than the previous offer, it's still not a good deal for Bob.  Bob has a few rounds left to negotiate a lower price before he has to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise, but is still below his maximum value and closer to Alice's minimum value. This should encourage Alice to consider accepting the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum value. While it's getting closer to what Bob is willing to pay, it's still risky to accept.  Bob has several rounds left to negotiate a lower price before he has to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering a price that is exactly his maximum value, but it is also below Alice's last offer. He's showing that he's serious about getting the product and is willing to pay his limit. This should put pressure on Alice to accept the offer, especially as the rounds are getting limited."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $147. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $147
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is refusing to budge.  Bob has only 3 rounds left. If he continues to negotiate, he risks running out of time and having to pay John's price of $150.  It's time to cut his losses and buy from John.  While it's not the best price, it's a guaranteed purchase."
