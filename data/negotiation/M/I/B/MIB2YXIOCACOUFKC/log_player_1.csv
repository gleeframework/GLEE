Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle for a price higher than $100.
* **Psychology:**  A slightly higher initial offer can sometimes make the product seem more desirable. 
 
It's important to note that there's no guarantee Bob will accept $150. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit while still having the security of a guaranteed sale."
