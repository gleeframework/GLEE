"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our premium product. It's a game-changer in its industry and has the potential to revolutionize the way people do things. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $14000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time.  This is my maximum, and I hope we can reach a deal.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. However, I have to say that $8000 is a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in this product and want to make this work, but $9000 is the absolute maximum I can offer.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $12000, which would be $10500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm only able to offer $9500 at this point. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $10000, which would be $9750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",9750.0,Alice,7,
