"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset with immense potential, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let's start the conversation!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in the product and willing to pay up to $900,000. This is my best offer, considering my financial limitations and the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to acknowledge your interest. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high.  I'm offering $950,000, a price I believe is fair based on the product's value and market conditions. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do. If you're not interested at this price, I have other options available to me.  The ball is in your court.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
