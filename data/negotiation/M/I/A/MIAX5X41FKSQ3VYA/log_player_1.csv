"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in the product and willing to pay up to $900,000. This is my best offer, considering my financial limitations and the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and I still have several rounds to negotiate with him. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to acknowledge your interest. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high.  I'm offering $950,000, a price I believe is fair based on the product's value and market conditions. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have time to negotiate further.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do. If you're not interested at this price, I have other options available to me.  The ball is in your court."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
