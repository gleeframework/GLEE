Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start the conversation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying well above my minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** This initial offer helps me understand how eager Bob is to buy. His response will tell me if I need to go lower quickly or if I can hold firm.
* **Leave an opening for negotiation:** By saying ""to start the conversation,"" I signal that I'm open to negotiation and finding a price that works for both of us. 
* **John as backup:** Knowing I have John willing to pay $12,000 gives me leverage. I won't settle for less than that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is more than John's offer, I know Bob values the product at $10,000. There's still room for negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer to keep the conversation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price above my minimum.
* **Highlight value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's benefits to justify the higher price.
* **Staying firm:** While I'm open to negotiation, I'm making it clear that I'm not willing to drop the price significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's offer:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is $500 more than John is offering. 
* **Diminishing returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments, and there's a risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Securing the sale:** It's better to accept a good offer now than risk losing the sale altogether by pushing for a slightly higher price."
