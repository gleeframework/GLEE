"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($80).  Since we have 10 rounds and the goal is to save as much money as possible, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $92? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is willing to compromise, $92 is still a bit higher than I want to pay.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a price closer to $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $88. It's closer to your original price point and a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $88 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent price, it's still closer to Alice's end of the negotiation than mine.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired $85.  With 5 rounds left, I think it's worth seeing if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $95 is still a little high for me.  How about $90?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a good price for you, but I'm still not getting the value I want. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $97? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are running out of rounds, and the price is still above my target. While Alice has been willing to negotiate, it seems she's unwilling to go lower than $97.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $120, as it guarantees the deal and saves me time and potential further negotiation headaches.  While it's not ideal, it's the best option to ensure I get the product within the remaining rounds."
