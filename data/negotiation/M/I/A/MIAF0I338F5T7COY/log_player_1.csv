Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's go with $12,500.
