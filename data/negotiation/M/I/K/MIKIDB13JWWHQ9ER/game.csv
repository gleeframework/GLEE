"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $130. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This still gives you a great deal on the product, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $120?  That's my final offer, and it's the price John is offering as well.  Let me know if you're willing to do that.",120.0,Bob,4,
