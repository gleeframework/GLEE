"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9,500? This would be a good compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting this deal done. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $10,000. How about we try $10,500? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's worth it to get this deal done.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable going any lower. Let me think for a moment... How about we try $10,200? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it to get the deal done.",10200.0,Alice,7,
