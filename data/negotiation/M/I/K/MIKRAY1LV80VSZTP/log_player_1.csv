"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not outrageously so. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a good profit.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the value of the product and positions it as a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to respond and allows for a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **Preparing for Exit:**  I'm aware of John's offer, and I'm prepared to walk away if the negotiation with Bob isn't fruitful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $900,000 is better than John's offer, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm in a good position because Bob is clearly interested. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I still have 9 rounds to negotiate. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can pressure him to increase his bid.
* **Avoiding Immediate Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean a loss compared to what John is offering. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000 to reflect the true value of this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  Let's continue the conversation."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  I'm not dropping the price too drastically, but I'm also acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's unique value to emphasize its potential for Bob and justify a higher price.
* **Maintaining Openness:** I'm encouraging continued discussion and suggesting we can find a mutually agreeable price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think that's a reasonable price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $950,000 is tempting, I'm not yet at my minimum acceptable price, and Bob's message indicates a willingness to negotiate further.
* **Seeking Higher Value:** I believe there's still potential to get closer to my target price of $1,100,000, especially as I'm still in the early rounds of negotiation.
* **Avoiding Loss:**  While selling to John would be a safe option, I'm confident that by continuing the negotiation, I can achieve a better outcome. 

I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value this product holds for you.  I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Pressure:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but not so much that I'm losing significant profit.  This puts pressure on Bob to reciprocate.
* **Highlighting Value & Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value and emphasizing the significant discount I'm offering.
* **Maintaining Confidence:**  I'm expressing confidence that this is a fair deal for both of us, subtly reminding Bob that this might be his last chance to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:** While $975,000 is a tempting price, it's still a considerable loss compared to John's offer of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  We are nearing the middle ground, and I still have 4 rounds to negotiate. I believe there's a good chance I can push Bob to increase his offer.
* **Avoiding Immediate Loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on a better deal with John.  

I will continue negotiating with Bob in the hopes of securing a price closer to my desired amount."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but I need to be closer to $1,025,000 to make this deal work.  This is a very unique product with significant potential for your business, and I'm confident this will be a valuable investment.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Narrowing the Gap:** My offer is only $50,000 away from Bob's last offer, demonstrating a strong willingness to compromise and encouraging him to meet me halfway.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value and its potential to benefit his business, subtly highlighting that he's gaining a significant advantage.
* **Urgency & Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the negotiation as a final effort to find a mutually beneficial solution, putting pressure on Bob to close the deal while still maintaining a positive and cooperative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value you're placing on the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $990,000 is very close to John's offer of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Time:** We are in round 8, leaving only two rounds remaining. There is a significant risk that we won't be able to close a deal with Bob at a price that's significantly better than John's.
* **Risk of Counteroffers:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer in the next round, and there's a chance he could even lower it. 
* **Avoiding Further Loss:**  Selling to John guarantees a secure profit, preventing the possibility of further negotiations that might result in a lower final price.

This decision is based on maximizing my profit with limited time and minimizing risk. While I would prefer a higher price, selling to John is the most sensible choice in this situation."
