"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product and I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $87.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
 Alice's offer of $87.50 is a good deal for Bob, as it's within his budget of $100 and is closer to his desired price point of $85.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially driving the price up or even ending the negotiation is not worth it. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking losing it."
