"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you believe the product's value is higher, but I'm still not convinced that $1,375,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,350,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
