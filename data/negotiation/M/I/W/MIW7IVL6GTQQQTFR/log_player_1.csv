Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value, giving me some room to negotiate. It also shows Bob that I value this product highly and am not desperate to sell.  Let's see if he's willing to pay that much!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a reasonable compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get a deal done without pushing Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not willing to go any lower, and the risk of continuing to negotiate with him and ending up with nothing is too high. It's time to move on to John and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000."
