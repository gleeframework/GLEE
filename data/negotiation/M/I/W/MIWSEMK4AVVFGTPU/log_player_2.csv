# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further and understanding your perspective on the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $2,000,000 is well over his budget. It makes sense to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the product's value.  While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, the true worth of this product goes beyond that.  I'd be willing to part with it for $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects a more accurate valuation while still making it a worthwhile investment for you.
