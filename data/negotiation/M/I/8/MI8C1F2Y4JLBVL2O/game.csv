"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me.  Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $825,000? That leaves us both with a decent profit.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $825,000. How about we meet in the middle at $812,500? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",812500.0,Bob,4,
