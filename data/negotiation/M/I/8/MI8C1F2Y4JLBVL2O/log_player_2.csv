"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $825,000? That leaves us both with a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.
