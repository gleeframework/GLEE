Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target:**  Maximize my profit.
* **Risk:**  If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. 
* **Strategy:** I'm offering a price higher than John's offer, hoping Bob values the product enough to pay more. This creates a potential for a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** A $500,000 markup is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation if needed."
