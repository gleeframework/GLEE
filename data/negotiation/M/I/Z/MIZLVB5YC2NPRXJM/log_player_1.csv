{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115, which is above what the product is worth to Bob, but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if he counters. If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers.  However, I also have the option to go with John's offer of $120 if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but it's closer than his initial rejection. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about $108? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $108 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price. I'll reject his offer and make a final counteroffer.  If he rejects it, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate that. This is my final offer: $112.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'll need to go with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 112}
