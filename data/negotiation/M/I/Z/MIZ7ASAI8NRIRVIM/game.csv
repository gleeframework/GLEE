"Hi Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering it's worth less to me than it is to you. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to make a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  How about $1,000,000? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering our both our desired outcomes.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $900,000 is a good start, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This would allow us both to reach a satisfactory agreement.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
