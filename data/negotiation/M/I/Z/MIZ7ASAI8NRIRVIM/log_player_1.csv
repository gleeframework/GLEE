"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit. It's above Bob's perceived value, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering it's worth less to me than it is to you. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to make a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  How about $1,000,000? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering our both our desired outcomes.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try to push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $900,000 is a good start, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This would allow us both to reach a satisfactory agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm increasing the offer slightly, but staying below my John's offer price of $1,000,000.  This demonstrates flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit."
