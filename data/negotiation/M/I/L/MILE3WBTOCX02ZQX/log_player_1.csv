{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant returns you'll gain. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $1,500,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price with John ($1,400,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Win-Win Situation:**  This price point still allows me to make a substantial profit while offering Bob a product he values at a price lower than my alternative buyer. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** Mentioning other interested parties encourages Bob to make a decision quickly."
