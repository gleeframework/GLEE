"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's value of $10,000.  Offering $10,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and shows Bob is serious about negotiating. It also leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still potential for a better deal. Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to $10,500, his last offer.  It's still a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing Alice he's willing to negotiate while staying within his budget.  $11,000 is a good compromise point, and could potentially be accepted by Alice who is likely looking to close the deal.  It also keeps the possibility of further negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is a very good deal for Bob. It is significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to Bob's ideal price.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting Bob's counteroffer and potentially ending the deal is high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
