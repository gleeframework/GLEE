Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is above my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $140. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still leaves room for Bob to gain a bit of a discount while giving me a more profitable sale than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer, Bob's counteroffer of $135 is a good compromise. It's a better price than selling to John and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
