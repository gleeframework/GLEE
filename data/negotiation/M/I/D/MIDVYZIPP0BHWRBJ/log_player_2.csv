"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's truly one-of-a-kind. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within Bob's budget:**  $875,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $1,000,000.
* **Alice is unlikely to go lower:** Alice has already stated this is the lowest she's willing to go.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away or Bob having to pay John's higher price.

Accepting the offer saves Bob $125,000 compared to buying from John.  It's the best outcome considering the limited room for further negotiation."
