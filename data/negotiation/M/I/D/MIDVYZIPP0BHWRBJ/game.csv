"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
