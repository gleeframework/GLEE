"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  He starts by making a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong negotiating tactic, as it shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  A counteroffer of $12,000 is a substantial discount from the initial $14,000, but still within a range that Bob is willing to pay.  This gives Alice room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to potentially get a very good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point. Bob has already successfully lowered the price and can likely negotiate a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get a price closer to his $12,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing that he's willing to compromise. He's increased his offer from $12,000 to $13,000, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway. This counteroffer demonstrates his seriousness about closing the deal while still trying to save a bit more money. It's a good middle ground, potentially leading to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,200.  This is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $13,000 and is a good price.  While it's possible to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John increases with each round. Accepting this offer secures a good deal without risking further negotiation."
