"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $15000 to me. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it, but that's my maximum price. Can you meet me in the middle or consider a lower price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13500. It's a fair price, considering the product's quality and potential benefits. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $11000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can you consider this offer?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product and your budget constraints. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can you consider this offer?",11000.0,Bob,6,
