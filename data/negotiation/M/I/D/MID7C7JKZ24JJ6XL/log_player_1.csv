Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but still potentially appealing to Bob given the product's value to him.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I could take the $750,000 and be done with it,  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering Bob $850,000. This is still a good profit for me and likely within Bob's range, given that he was willing to offer $750,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher offer, and I risk losing the sale to John. It's best to accept and secure the sale."
