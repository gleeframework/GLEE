It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price.  You can offer a price closer to your maximum of $800,000 and see if Alice is willing to come down."

I'm offering $750,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still a fair price considering the product is worth $800,000 to me.  Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice is coming down, but I'm still not willing to pay $850,000. I'm going to counteroffer again, trying to get closer to my target price."

I'm going to offer Alice my maximum price of $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's the value of the product to me and it's only slightly lower than her last offer."
