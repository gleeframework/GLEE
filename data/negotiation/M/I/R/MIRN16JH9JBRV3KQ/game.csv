"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1200000. This aligns with my budget and reflects a fair value for both of us. I'm confident this price is reasonable considering the product's potential benefits. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is a significant amount, it doesn't fully reflect the true value and potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects a compromise on my end while still acknowledging the product's worth. I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both.  Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1350000 is a step in the right direction, it's still slightly higher than my budget allows. I'm confident that $1250000 is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. It would be a mutually beneficial deal, allowing us to close the transaction without jeopardizing our respective financial goals. Let's explore this option and see if we can reach a final agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
