"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly and encouraging message can help build rapport and keep the negotiation open.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob can make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** While $950,000 is a good price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob showed a willingness to compromise in the first round. 
* **Future rounds:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a higher price.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's current proposal, leaving space for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Value:**  $975,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I don't lose out financially.
* **Positive Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging, aiming for a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $960,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $960,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I'm still not comfortable accepting it.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown a willingness to compromise. 
* **Time factor:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still higher than Bob's current proposal, leaving space for further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $965,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to you, and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 965000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's the average of my previous offer and Bob's current offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Closing pressure:**  I'm adding a bit of pressure by mentioning it's the best I can do, encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to make the offer more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $962,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:** While $962,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough to make me comfortable selling.
* **Time and negotiation:** I still have four rounds left, giving me time to negotiate further and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees my minimum value, I believe there's still a good chance of getting closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Next steps:**  I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's current offer but still below my minimum, leaving room for a final agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I want to make this work too.  I'm willing to go up to $964,000 for the product. This is a great price for you, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 964000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm increasing my offer to $964,000, which is only slightly higher than Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging, emphasizing a desire for a win-win situation.
* **Finality:**  I'm suggesting this is a ""great price"" and implying that it's a final offer.
* **Pressure:**  I'm mentioning the need to finalize the deal, putting a bit of pressure on Bob to accept.

**Rationale:**

This counteroffer is a calculated risk. It's still below my minimum acceptable value, but it's getting closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of a deal. With only three rounds remaining, the pressure is on to reach an agreement before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $963,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $963,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $963,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $963,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Limited time:** With only two rounds left, there's a high chance that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price.
* **Risk of losing deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John as a buyer.
* **Potential for future business:** Accepting this offer might open doors for future business with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's close enough to my minimum value and there's a risk of losing the deal entirely if I continue negotiating."
