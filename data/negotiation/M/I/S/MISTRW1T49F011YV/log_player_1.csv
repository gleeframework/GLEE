{
""message"": ""Bob, I know this product is valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $990,000. This is a one-time offer before I move forward with another interested party."",
""product_price"": 990000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), it's always best to try for the highest possible profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $800,000, so we need to offer a price that's appealing yet profitable for us.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning ""another interested party,"" we create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

This offer aims to extract the maximum value from Bob while still being attractive enough for him to accept."
