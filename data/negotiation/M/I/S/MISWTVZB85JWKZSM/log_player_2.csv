"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's initial offer is above your maximum price.
* It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you taking the time to talk to me. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm prepared to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* It's still above your maximum price, giving Alice some room to negotiate.
* Offering a middle ground shows you're willing to compromise, making a deal more likely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,800 is still within your budget of $10,000.
* While you could potentially negotiate further, it's not a significant enough difference to warrant the risk of losing the deal. 
* It's always good to secure a deal when you're comfortable with the price, especially since you have the alternative of buying from John at $10,000."
