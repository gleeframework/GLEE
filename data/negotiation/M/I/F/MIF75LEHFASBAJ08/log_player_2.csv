"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a steal considering its value to you! Let's make this a win-win situation. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both parties to make a better deal.  

By rejecting the offer, Bob can start the counteroffer process and attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $950,000 is a good start, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product. It's still a great price for you, considering what it's worth. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that considers both our interests. Let's close this deal and move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is a significant drop from her initial offer of $950,000. This is a good deal for Bob, as it saves him $100,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation could potentially yield a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting Bob's counteroffer and ultimately needing to buy from John for $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings."
