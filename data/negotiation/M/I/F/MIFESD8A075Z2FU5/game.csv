"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,500.  This is a great deal, as the product is worth significantly more than that to you. Let me know your thoughts!",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $12,500? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know if you're interested!",12500.0,Alice,3,
