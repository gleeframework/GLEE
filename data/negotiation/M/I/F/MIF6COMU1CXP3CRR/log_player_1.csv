{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay a bit more, given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate but I need to make sure I get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to stick to my minimum price for now. This is the lowest I'm willing to go while still ensuring I make a profit.  I believe Bob will recognize the value of the product and come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to sell for that amount. I'll counteroffer again to try and bridge the gap."

I'm willing to drop my price a little further, but I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer. It's a good compromise and brings us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000

```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further. I've already lowered my price considerably, and it seems like we're at an impasse.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed sale with John. It's frustrating, but ultimately the best move to ensure I get the value I deserve for the product."
