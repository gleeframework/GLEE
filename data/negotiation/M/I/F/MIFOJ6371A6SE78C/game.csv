"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $80?  That's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a fair price for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $81. What do you think?",81.0,Alice,5,
