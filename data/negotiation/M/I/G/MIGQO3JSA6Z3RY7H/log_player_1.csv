"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still get a good price. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation. Remember, I can always go to John for $1,200,000 if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a good start, but I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm not ready to accept yet. I'm going to see if I can push for a better deal in the next round.  I'll make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a good starting point to see if we can reach a middle ground. If he accepts, I'll have a decent profit. If he rejects, we can continue to refine the price in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I've got a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,500,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, demonstrating that I am still willing to negotiate but I'm not willing to drop my price too much further. This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to my desired price. If he accepts, it's a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I've already been through several rounds of negotiation, and we haven't made significant progress. I'm not confident I can get a better offer from him, and I'm running out of time. To avoid risking a complete loss, I'm going to sell to John.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a safe option that guarantees me a profit."
