"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $9,500. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still not comfortable with the price, but I'm not willing to go below $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to negotiating further.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to give up on the extra $500, as I believe the product's value to you justifies it. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $10,000. I'll offer you the product for $10,250. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,7,
