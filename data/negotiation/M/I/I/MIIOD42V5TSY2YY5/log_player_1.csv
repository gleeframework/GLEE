Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its significant worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,500,000. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to get Bob to pay as close to $1,500,000 as possible without exceeding his valuation so much that he rejects the offer. 

* **Starting High:** The offered price of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's valuation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price. 
* **Fallback:** If Bob rejects the offer, you are secure knowing John will purchase it at your desired minimum."
