"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of 1175000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  I'm willing to offer $1100000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the price. I'll offer you a price of 1150000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the negotiation.  While I'm willing to compromise,  $1150000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to go as high as $1125000, and I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals.  If you're not comfortable with this price, I'm prepared to consider my other options.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
