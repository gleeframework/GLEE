"Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my original offer of $12000. This is my final offer, as I can always purchase the product from John for that price. ",12000.0,Bob,4,
