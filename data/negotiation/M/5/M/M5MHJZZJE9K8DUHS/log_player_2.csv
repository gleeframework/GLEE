"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is asking for $120. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **You want to save money.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and potentially get a better deal.
* **You have time.** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's no need to rush into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $100 is still a bit low for me.  How about $110? That gives us both a good deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, you're still aiming to get a price closer to your $100 counteroffer. 
* **You have room for negotiation.** You have several rounds left, and there's still a chance Alice will come down further.
* **Buying from John is still too expensive.**  You want to see if you can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $110 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $105. This would be a good compromise, and we can both move forward with the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
