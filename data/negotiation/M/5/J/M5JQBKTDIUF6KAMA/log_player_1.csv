{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've shown interest in. I'd be happy to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  It's important to note that this is just the initial offer, and I'm prepared to adjust it based on Bob's response and how confident I feel about getting a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $100 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I appreciate your interest. While $100 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $110.  This gives us both a fair deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep the cost at or below $100 if possible. Could we perhaps aim for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is a decent price, it's not worth risking another round of negotiation for the extra $5. I'm confident John will buy the product for $100, which is my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale for a small price difference."
