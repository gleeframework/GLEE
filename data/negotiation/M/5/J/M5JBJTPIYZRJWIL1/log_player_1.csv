Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a sale.  Here's why:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're getting $200,000 more than your guaranteed price from John.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** Bob still gets a $200,000 benefit by buying from you. This makes the offer attractive to him.

While you could try for a higher price, there's a risk Bob will reject it and you'll only get $800,000 from John. This offer gives you a good chance of getting the best possible price."
