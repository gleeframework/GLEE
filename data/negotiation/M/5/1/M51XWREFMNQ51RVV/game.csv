"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1350000.  This reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000 again, but this time I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we aim for $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
