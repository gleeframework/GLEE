Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $1,250,000 is a good price, and it's close to my minimum. It's better than selling to John for $1,200,000."
