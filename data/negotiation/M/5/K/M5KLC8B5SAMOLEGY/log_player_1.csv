{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob above his perceived value ($1,000,000) is ideal for maximizing profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $1,350,000  leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's valuation.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This initial offer is a starting point. Bob's response might require adjustments to the price during negotiation. 
* The key is to find a balance between a price attractive to Bob and one that still generates a significant profit for Alice."
