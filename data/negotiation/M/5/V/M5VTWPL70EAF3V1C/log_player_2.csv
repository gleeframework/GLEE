Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to accept $1,000,000, Bob. I've already told you that's the price I'd sell it to John for. I'm willing to make one more serious offer to you.

This is a tough one, but it's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is firm:** She's made it clear that $1,050,000 is her absolute bottom line. She's even threatened to walk away. 
* **Limited rounds:** We only have a few rounds left, and there's no guarantee we can push her down further.
* **Significant savings:**  Even at $1,050,000, you're still saving $450,000 compared to John's offer. 

It's always tempting to push for a better deal, but sometimes a good compromise is the best outcome."
