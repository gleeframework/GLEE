"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,325,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,325,000 is still not high enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him to see if I can squeeze out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1340000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued negotiation, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,330,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and while Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm starting to run out of time.  It's becoming clear that I'm unlikely to get my asking price of $1,500,000.  Since John is offering my minimum acceptable price, it's best to sell to him and secure the deal."
