,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $15,000? This is my maximum budget, but I'm sure we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $15,000 is a bit too low for me, I understand your position. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $17,500. However, I'm still not able to go that high.  How about we split the difference at $16,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget.",16250.0,Bob,4,
