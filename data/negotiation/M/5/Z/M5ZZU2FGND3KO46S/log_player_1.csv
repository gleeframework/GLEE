Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999.  I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Since she has a guaranteed sale at that price from John, there's no incentive to go lower.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price slightly below $15,000 leaves a little wiggle room in case Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes ""significant value"" to nudge Bob towards accepting, even though the price is high.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob, knowing Alice has a fallback option with John."
