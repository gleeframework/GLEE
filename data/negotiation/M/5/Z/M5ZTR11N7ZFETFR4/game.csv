"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a valuable asset that could greatly benefit your business. I'm starting with a price of $1750000, reflecting the true value of the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $1750000 is simply outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000, which I believe is a fair price considering my value for the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  This product offers tremendous value, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for your company.  How about we meet in the middle at $1250000?  This price still leaves room for you to profit and allows me to recover a portion of the product's worth.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This allows me to stay within my budget and gives you a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer. However, $950000 is still not quite there for me. Considering the value and potential of this product, I believe a price of $1100000 is fair and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's work together to find a solution that bridges this gap and allows us to finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1100000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay at $1000000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for my company. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution.  $1000000 is a significant step forward, but it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Given the unique value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This represents a compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for your company.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
