{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a valuable asset that could greatly benefit your business.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $1750000 is simply outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000, which I believe is a fair price considering my value for the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I need to see if I can push Bob closer to that value.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  This product offers tremendous value, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for your company.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This price still leaves room for you to profit and allows me to recover a portion of the product's worth.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This allows me to stay within my budget and gives you a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. However, I see a trend of his offers going up, and there's a chance he might be willing to come closer to my target. I'll counteroffer again to see if I can close the gap further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your increased offer. However, $950,000 is still not quite there for me. Considering the value and potential of this product, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's work together to find a solution that bridges this gap and allows us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1100000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay at $1000000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for my company. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to accept it yet.  I've already made several concessions and I believe I can push Bob a little further. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round to see if I can close the deal closer to my target price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution.  $1,000,000 is a significant step forward, but it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Given the unique value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.
