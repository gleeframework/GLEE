"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $100.  Would you be willing to do $125? That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a limit, but $125 is still too much for me. Let's split the difference - how about $112.50?",112.5,Bob,6,
