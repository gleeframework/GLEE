Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob first is ideal.  Offering a price slightly below John's offer ($1,400,000) aims to maximize profit while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning another buyer and setting a deadline, we create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. The ""exclusive opportunity"" framing adds to the product's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $1,400,000, there's a slight possibility for negotiation if Bob counters. This leaves us with potential to secure a price even closer to $1,500,000."
