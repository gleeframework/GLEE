Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you. I'm asking for $2,000,000. Given its potential, I'm confident this is a more than fair price."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:**  Phrasing like ""immense value"" and ""more than fair price"" subtly anchors the value in Bob's mind.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value, it doesn't completely price him out. He might try to negotiate, giving you the opportunity to potentially secure a price above your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is somewhat open to negotiation. If you know he's extremely price-sensitive, you might want to start lower.
* **Market Dynamics:** If there's a chance the product's value could increase or you might get a higher offer from another buyer, you could aim even higher."
