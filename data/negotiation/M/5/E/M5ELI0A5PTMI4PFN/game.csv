"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $20000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm thinking of a price of $17000. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $17000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",16000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I need to make a bit more. I'm thinking of a price of $16500. It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for this product.",16500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but $16500 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",16200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm thinking of a price of $16000, which is the same as your last offer. I think this is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. Let's see if we can finally agree on a price.",16000.0,Alice,9,
