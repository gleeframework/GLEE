{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $14,000 is a good price, and it's important to close the deal.  I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, I may risk losing Bob as a buyer and be forced to settle for John's $12,000 offer."
