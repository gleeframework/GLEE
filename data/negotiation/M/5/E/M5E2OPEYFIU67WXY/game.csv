"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this time. I'm willing to offer $750000. Would you be open to negotiating at this price point?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $850000? I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $850000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
