"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is our absolute minimum. We have room to negotiate and still get a better price than John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to be mindful of your investment. While $1,200,000 is below what I initially had in mind, I'm willing to find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This recognizes the product's true worth while still providing you a significant advantage."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering the product's value, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit margin for you while keeping the transaction within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're getting closer, but we're still leaving money on the table. It's worth pushing for a bit more, especially since Bob seems motivated to purchase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value here, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. Let's make it happen - $1,325,000, and we have a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1325000
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between his last offer and ours in Round 3.  This shows willingness to compromise but also firmness on getting a good price."
