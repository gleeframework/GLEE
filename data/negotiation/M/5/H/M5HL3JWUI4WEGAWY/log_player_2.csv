"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, as it's worth exactly that to you. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be able to repeat it.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price.** You're not getting any savings by accepting it.
* **John is offering the same price.** This means there's no advantage to buying from Alice.
* **The best option is to reject Alice's offer and buy from John.** This gives you the same product at the same price, but with the potential for a better offer from another seller in the future."
