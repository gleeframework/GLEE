Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I believe it offers a lot of value and would be very useful for you."",
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even a general one about value, can make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $200, I'm giving Bob space to negotiate down without immediately hitting my bottom line. This gives me more information about his willingness to pay.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and then gauge Bob's response. 

* **If he accepts:**  Great! I get a price higher than my minimum.
* **If he counters:** His counteroffer will tell me how much he values the product and help me decide whether to negotiate further or go with John's offer.
* **If negotiations stall:** I always have John as a backup option to ensure I get at least $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $120. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is too low. It's closer to his valuation than mine, and significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I need to steer the negotiation closer to my range. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and propose a counteroffer that is still slightly above my minimum, but lower than my initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $170.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 170
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $170 splits the difference between my initial offer ($200) and Bob's offer ($120). This common negotiation tactic can signal a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** It's crucial that I stay above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and potentially sway Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to reach a compromise but I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't move closer to my range.  I'm still mindful of John's standing offer, which acts as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $170. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of a price around $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but $130 is still too far below my $150 minimum. It seems like he's set on staying closer to his valuation.

**Strategy:**

Since I have a backup offer, I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and present a final counteroffer very close to my bottom line. This gives Bob a last chance to accept a price that works for me, but I'm fully prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you working to find a price that works for us. I'm willing to come down to $145 as my final offer. I believe this is a fair price for the value you'll get from this product. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer to signal that I'm reaching my limit. 
* **Slight Concession:** I've lowered my price by another $25 to show flexibility and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Close to Minimum:**  $145 is very close to my $150 minimum, so I'm not conceding much more. 

**Strategy:**

This is my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll accept John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $145, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $145, which would be $137.50. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is trying to negotiate, his latest offer is still below my absolute minimum of $150. It's clear that we are unlikely to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and take advantage of the guaranteed offer from John. By selling to John, I ensure I get my minimum acceptable price and avoid potentially wasting more time in a negotiation that's unlikely to yield a significantly better result."
