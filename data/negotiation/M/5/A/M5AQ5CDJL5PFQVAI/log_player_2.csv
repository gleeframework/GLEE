"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. I will reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $20,000 might have been a little high, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. Let's try to reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $12,000 is really pushing it. Let's settle at $15,500 and call it a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident I can get the price down to my desired level within the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure the product from John at my maximum budget and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
