Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can do $9,000, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is offering the product for $9,000.  While I might be able to push her a little further, there's a risk she'll become less flexible. Accepting at $9,000 secures a good discount and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
