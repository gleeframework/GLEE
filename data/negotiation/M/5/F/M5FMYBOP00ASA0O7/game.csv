"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be happy to pay $1000000 for the product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1350000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm willing to offer $1200000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price.  While I'm still not at $1300000, I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1250000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1250000 and $1350000, which is $1300000. I'm now offering the product to you for $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
