"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and would be a great addition to your collection. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I initially offered, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiation so far. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,250,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
