Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value. What do you think?

At this point, Bob is offering $960,000, which is still below my minimum price of $1,000,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Bob will come up to my price.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees my desired return, so that's the best option."
