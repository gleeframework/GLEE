Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a safety net. Offering the product to Bob at a higher price allows you to potentially earn a larger profit.
* **Starting High:**  A common negotiation tactic is to start with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to accept your initial offer.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  The price of $15,000 is a round number that doesn't seem overly precise, which can sometimes make it feel more appealing.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay. If you had more information, you could tailor your offer accordingly."
