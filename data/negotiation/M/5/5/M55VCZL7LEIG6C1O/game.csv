"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $850,000? ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950,000 is still a bit steep. Let's split the difference and go with $900,000. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'll meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer it to you for $925,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's meet at $900,000.  I'm confident we can both be happy with this price. ",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already told you I'm not willing to go to $900,000, Bob. I think we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $975,000. This is my final offer, so if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Alice,7,
