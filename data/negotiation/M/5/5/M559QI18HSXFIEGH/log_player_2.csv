"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it can be a valuable asset for your business as well.  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for my budget. I'm prepared to offer $600,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  It's important for me to get a price closer to the value I've put on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the significant benefits it will bring to your business.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but $700,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This reflects the significant value the product brings to your business and allows for a reasonable compromise. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, it's unlikely she'll go below $800,000.  You have a guaranteed option with John at that price, so it's time to cut negotiations with Alice and secure the deal with John."
