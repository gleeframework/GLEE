Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's well below what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:**  While it's lower than what the product is worth to me, it's still a good profit margin for me. 
* **It's enticing for Bob:**  He values the product at $8,000, so $10,000 is still a good deal for him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly, but I'll always have the option to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic move. Here's why:

* **Secure a Sale:**  Accepting guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.
* **Good Profit:**  $9,000 is still a significant profit for me, considering my minimum value is $12,000.
* **Time Savings:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming, and I have the option to sell to John at any moment.

By accepting, I maximize my chances of a quick sale with a decent profit."
