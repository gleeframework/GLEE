"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit. I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so I'm leaving room for negotiation.  However, I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to me, so I won't settle for anything less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I need to be strategic, I won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm coming down from my initial offer, but still aiming for a profit.  $1,300,000 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's low offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation, but I'm not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to earn more, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer guarantees me a fair profit and avoids any further negotiation."
