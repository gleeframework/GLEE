"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get the product for $80 from John, so any offer less than that is beneficial.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so a counteroffer of $70 is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than Alice's initial offer but still a potentially acceptable price for Alice, given her valuation of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $72 is better than John's price of $80, and it's within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. Accepting the offer saves Bob $8, and the negotiation is complete."
