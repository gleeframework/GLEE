Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob still gets a good deal. Here's why:

* **It's higher than my minimum:**  I'm aiming for a profit greater than my minimum of $10,000.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so he's still getting a good deal at $11,500. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, I can still negotiate up to $12,000.

By offering $11,500, I have a good chance of striking a deal with Bob while still getting a profitable price."
