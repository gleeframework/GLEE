"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  While I can't disclose all the details without a confidentiality agreement, I'm confident it aligns with your company's strategic goals. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a significant investment, but I'm sure the return will be substantial. Let's discuss further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth exploring if there's room for negotiation, so we'll reject the offer and try to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm intrigued by the product, $1,500,000 is far outside my budget.  Given my understanding of the market value for similar products and my company's financial constraints, I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for this opportunity. This reflects a significant investment for me, and I believe it represents a fair value proposition for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's crucial to understand the unique potential and future applications. Consider this: I'm willing to come down to $1200000, reflecting a significant compromise on my part. This price still offers you a considerable return on your investment, and I believe it's a mutually beneficial starting point for further discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice is still too high, but we're getting closer.  We'll reject this offer and try to bring her down further."

This represents a fair middle ground, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties."", ""product_price"": 900000}
