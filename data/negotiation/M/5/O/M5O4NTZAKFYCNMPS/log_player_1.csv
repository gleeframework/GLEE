Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm intrigued by the product, $1500000 is far outside my budget.  Given my understanding of the market value for similar products and my company's financial constraints, I'm prepared to offer $800000 for this opportunity. This reflects a significant investment for me, and I believe it represents a fair value proposition for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This represents a fair middle ground, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties.
