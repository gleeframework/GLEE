"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  While I can't disclose all the details without a confidentiality agreement, I'm confident it aligns with your company's strategic goals. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a significant investment, but I'm sure the return will be substantial. Let's discuss further if you're interested.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm intrigued by the product, $1500000 is far outside my budget.  Given my understanding of the market value for similar products and my company's financial constraints, I'm prepared to offer $800000 for this opportunity. This reflects a significant investment for me, and I believe it represents a fair value proposition for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's crucial to understand the unique potential and future applications. Consider this: I'm willing to come down to $1200000, reflecting a significant compromise on my part. This price still offers you a considerable return on your investment, and I believe it's a mutually beneficial starting point for further discussion.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000,  which reflects a substantial investment for me while acknowledging the unique potential you've described. This represents a fair middle ground, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties.",900000.0,Bob,4,
