"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is within his budget, it's still a significant amount. He should try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds to go, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the most logical choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower price than Alice's initial offer. He's aiming to get as close to his desired price as possible while leaving room for negotiation in the remaining rounds. Offering $9,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer but still leaves some space for her to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save money and $10,000 is still too high.  While he has fewer rounds left, he should continue negotiating. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives him a better chance of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product and willing to compromise.  Offering $9,500 is a reasonable compromise, allowing Alice to get more than her initial offer but still allowing Bob to save money."
