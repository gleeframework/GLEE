"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $17,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15,500, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $16,500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to go higher.",16500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",16000.0,Bob,6,
