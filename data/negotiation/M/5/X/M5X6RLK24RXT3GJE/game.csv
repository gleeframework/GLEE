"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $11,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see your point about the budget. I'm willing to come down to $10,900 for this product. That's the lowest I can go. I believe this is a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10900.0,Alice,7,
