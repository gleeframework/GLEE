"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find the product for a bit less. Would you consider selling it for $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $110?  It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose $107 as my counteroffer.",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. $107 is still a bit low for me.  To make a deal, I need to be closer to $110. How about we split the difference and go with $108.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",108.5,Alice,5,
