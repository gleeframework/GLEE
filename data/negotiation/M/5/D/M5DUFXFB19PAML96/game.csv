"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $950000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $975000.

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $990000, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I believe this is the minimum price that reflects the product's value. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. I'm willing to sell the product to someone who values it more. I'm counteroffering at $990000, and this is my last offer.",990000.0,Alice,7,
