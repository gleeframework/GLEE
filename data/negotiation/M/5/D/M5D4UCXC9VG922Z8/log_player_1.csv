Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $1,200,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have leverage to start high. 
* **Testing the waters:**  A significantly higher offer ($1,200,000) gauges Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves space for you to potentially lower the price while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 

Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, you can:

* **Negotiate:**  You can engage in a negotiation, potentially meeting somewhere between $800,000 and $1,200,000.
* **Accept John's offer:**  You have the security of John's offer, ensuring you won't lose money."
