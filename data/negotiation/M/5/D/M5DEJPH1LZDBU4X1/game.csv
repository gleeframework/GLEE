"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10000. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $13500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
