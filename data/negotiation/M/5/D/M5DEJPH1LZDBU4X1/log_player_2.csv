# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10000. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $13500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.

You're still looking to save as much as possible, and while $13,500 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
