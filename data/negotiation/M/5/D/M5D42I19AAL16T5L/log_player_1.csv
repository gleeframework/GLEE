Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's close this quickly!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation, but still provides you with a profit.  It's a bit above Bob's perceived value, making it tempting for him to accept, but also leaves space for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a raw deal.  

Remember, you can always lower your price slightly if Bob counters, but be prepared to walk away and sell to John if you feel the negotiations aren't going in your favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your offer, but I think $1150000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is still a good deal, it's only a $50,000 profit for you. It's worth pushing for a higher price, especially since John is willing to pay $1,200,000. You have leverage, and rejecting Bob's offer allows you to control the negotiation and potentially get closer to your desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,125,000. This price is still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It shows you are willing to negotiate, but it also keeps you closer to your desired profit margin. 

Remember, you can always lower your price further if needed, but you should try to get as close to your target price as possible.  Always be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob refuses to meet you halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1125000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1075000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,075,000 is still a decent profit, it's getting closer to the bottom of your acceptable range, and you're not getting the best deal. 

Bob is clearly trying to push for a lower price, but you have a higher offer from John. Rejecting his counteroffer allows you to push back and potentially get closer to your desired price or, if unsuccessful, you have a backup plan with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,075,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. It's a fair compromise, and it gives you a fantastic deal on a valuable product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer maintains a firm but fair stance. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting your bottom line. You're offering a price that's slightly closer to Bob's last offer, making it more likely for him to accept, but still ensures you make a reasonable profit. Remember, you always have John as a backup option, so don't be afraid to stand firm and walk away if Bob doesn't come to an agreement."
