"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $16,500 for this product. It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some wiggle room to meet my own needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? This would allow us both to make a fair deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
