"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is a decent amount, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $16,500 for this product. It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some wiggle room to meet my own needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? This would allow us both to make a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer of $15,500 is very close to my minimum.  This is a good deal, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
