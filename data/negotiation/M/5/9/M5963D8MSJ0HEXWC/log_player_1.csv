Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
