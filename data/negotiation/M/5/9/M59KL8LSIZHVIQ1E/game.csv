"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Could you do $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your persistence, I'm not comfortable going below $8,000.  Let's split the difference at $8,250.  That's a fair price for both of us, and would avoid any further back and forth.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $8,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  How about we make one final compromise and settle at $8,000 even?  That way you get a fair price, and I can stay within my spending limit.",8000.0,Bob,6,
