Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position and respect the value you place on the product. Based on my budget constraints, I am proposing a final offer of $1,625,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and I'm getting closer to my desired amount. It's also risky to keep negotiating with Bob as we're running out of rounds and John is always a viable option."
