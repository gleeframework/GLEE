"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate or go with John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 60}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $60 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I'm aiming low, knowing Alice will likely counter. This leaves space to gradually increase my offer while staying well below my $80 limit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This low offer will gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's completely unwilling to budge from her initial price, I can always walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $60 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still above my maximum budget. I'll counteroffer, aiming to meet somewhere between our two offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground. How about $75? That's a fair bit closer to your price and would work well for me."", ""product_price"": 75}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** $75 is a strong counteroffer that shows I'm willing to negotiate while staying within my budget.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer is closer to my limit, signaling to Alice that I'm serious but also that I'm not willing to go much higher. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I still have the option of buying from John for $80, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $75 is still a bit short of my target. I can do $95, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging and is still well above my $80 limit.  It's clear she's aiming for a price I'm not willing to pay. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
