"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $110?  I'm really keen on this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go back to the original offer of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $110, which would be $112.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",112.5,Alice,5,
