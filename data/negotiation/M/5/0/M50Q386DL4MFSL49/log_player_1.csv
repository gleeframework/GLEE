{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $115?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make this compromise."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer of $105 is too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $120.  I'll sell the product to John for $120."
