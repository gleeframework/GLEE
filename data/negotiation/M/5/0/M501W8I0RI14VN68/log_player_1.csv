Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer yet. I believe I can get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is simply too low.  How about $12,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $11,500? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $13,000, Bob's offer is reasonable, and we're getting close to the end of our rounds.  Accepting his offer is the best option to maximize profit while minimizing risk."
