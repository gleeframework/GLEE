Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above the $1,200,000 he's willing to pay.  Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,290,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a decent return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is very close to Bob's desired price, but it's still $90,000 more than what John is offering.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and buying from John ensures that he gets the best deal.  While there's a chance he could negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's also a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he might end up paying more. Buying from John guarantees the lowest price and avoids any further risk."
