"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is better than my minimum, it's still lower than I'd like to get. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still a good price for me. I hope this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I have a few rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal. I'm also considering that John is a guaranteed sale for $10,000, which is a solid backup if I can't get a better price from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I want to make sure I can secure a sale.  While I'm still hoping for a better price, I'm also mindful of the option of selling to John for $10,000 if I need to."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting close to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. With only two rounds left, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal.  I'm also considering the guaranteed sale to John for $10,000, which I may need to fall back on if I can't get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a final compromise, as it's the closest I'm willing to go to Bob's last offer.  We're down to our final round, and I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal. If not, I'll be forced to sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is our final round and I need to make a decision. While $12,900 is a decent price, it's still not what I was hoping for. Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a sale and allows me to move on.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's the most sensible choice at this point."
