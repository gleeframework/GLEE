"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11500 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we go with $11750? It's a fair compromise that leaves us both happy.  Let me know what you think.",11750.0,Alice,5,
