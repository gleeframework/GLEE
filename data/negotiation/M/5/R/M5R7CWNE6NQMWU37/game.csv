"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $105?  That's a good compromise, and it still gives me a fair profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm looking to save as much money as possible. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
