Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to my product's value ($100) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer a price that's appealing but doesn't give away too much profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have the security of selling to John for $100, so I don't need to go below that.

By offering the product at $99, I'm aiming for the highest price Bob might be willing to pay while still ensuring a profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I can confidently sell to John at my minimum acceptable price."
