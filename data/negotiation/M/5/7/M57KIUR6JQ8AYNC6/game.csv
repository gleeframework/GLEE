"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Could you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
