Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is significantly more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** $10,000 is still a good deal for Bob, leaving him with $2,000 in profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space to negotiate up or down if Bob counteroffers. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
