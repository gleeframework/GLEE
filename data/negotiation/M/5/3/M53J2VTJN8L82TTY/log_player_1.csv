{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love. I'm asking for $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum of $8,000.  I'm also being friendly and open to discussion to make Bob feel comfortable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is more than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $9,000 by continuing to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  That's a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to make a deal with Bob,  I'm not willing to go that low.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000 to ensure I get a fair price."
