"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a good price for both of us. Let's make a deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a good compromise and allows us both to save some money. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,000 is still too low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need at least $9,500 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value and the fact that we've been negotiating. Let's finalize this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a little more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to pay $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and we're getting closer to a deal. What do you think?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm running out of time. Let's be realistic. I'm willing to go down to $9,400, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to sell to someone else.  I'm confident that you'll find this to be a fair deal.",9400.0,Alice,7,
