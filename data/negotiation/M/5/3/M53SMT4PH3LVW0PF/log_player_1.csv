Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,500 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a good price for both of us. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a good compromise and allows us both to save some money. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While it's closer to what I want, $9,000 is still below my minimum price. I'll continue to negotiate with him, but I'm keeping my options open to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,000 is still too low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need at least $9,500 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value and the fact that we've been negotiating. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a little more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to pay $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and we're getting closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, $9,250 still isn't enough for me. I'll counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm running out of time. Let's be realistic. I'm willing to go down to $9,400, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to sell to someone else.  I'm confident that you'll find this to be a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9400}
