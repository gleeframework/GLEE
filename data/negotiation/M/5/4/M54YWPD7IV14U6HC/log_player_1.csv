{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find immensely valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $925,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations slightly above your desired outcome. This leaves room for concessions and signals that you value the product.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. Aiming for $925,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still offering Bob a good deal compared to his perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer is a starting point.  Bob's response will help gauge his willingness to pay, and you can adjust accordingly in subsequent counteroffers.
* **John as a Safety Net:** The presence of John, who's willing to pay your minimum acceptable price, provides a strong fallback position. You're not desperate, which empowers you to negotiate from a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the value in this product,  $925,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly below your target price and even below your minimum acceptable price ($800,000 from John).  While it's tempting to accept to avoid further negotiation, rejecting this offer sends a strong signal:

* **You're Serious:** It shows Bob you're not going to simply cave to a lowball offer.
* **Value Perception:**  It reinforces your belief in the product's high value.

You'll now have the opportunity to present a counteroffer that bridges the gap and potentially still secures a favorable deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a significant way off from what I had in mind. This product offers you substantial value, worth far exceeding your initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $887,500? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 887500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your initial offer ($925,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying the higher price.
* **Maintaining Firmness:** While compromising, you're not drastically dropping your price. This keeps the negotiation moving but maintains your strong position.

By making a reasonable but firm counteroffer, you increase the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you see the value in this product, and I do too. However, $887,500 is still a bit high for me. To meet in the middle, I'm willing to offer $865,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $865,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $865,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to your range, $865,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price from John. Additionally, Bob's consistent counteroffers suggest he's very interested in the product.  Rejecting again keeps the pressure on and indicates you're holding firm to a certain value. 

It's now time to decide if you want to counter close to your backup offer or leverage Bob's clear interest to push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's close this deal.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, my final offer.  This is a significant discount from my initial price and reflects my desire to see this valuable product in your hands."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and signal that this is as low as you're willing to go.
* **Strong Justification:** You're highlighting the significant price reduction, emphasizing the value Bob is receiving.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $875,000 is a strong position:
    * It's above your guaranteed price from John, maximizing your potential profit.
    * It's still a favorable deal for Bob considering his perceived value of $1,000,000. 

This counteroffer balances firmness with a willingness to close the deal, increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome for both parties."
