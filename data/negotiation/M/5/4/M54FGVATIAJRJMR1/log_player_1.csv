Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a discounted price of $10,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $12,000, there's a chance to get a better price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $10,000 is a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still represents a ""deal"" for him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is phrased to encourage a response from Bob. If he counters, I have room to negotiate down slightly while still exceeding my minimum price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
