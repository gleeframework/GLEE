```

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work.

Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
