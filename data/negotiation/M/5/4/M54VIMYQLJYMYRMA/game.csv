"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still provides a good return on my investment, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to you. Let's find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my comfort zone. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
