"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,075,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he's still trying to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice may be willing to go a little lower, and Bob has the option of buying from John if he can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still looking for a better deal.  I'm willing to go to $1,025,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not budging from there. I think we can find a mutually beneficial price, but I need you to meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been stubborn and is sticking to her $1,075,000 offer.  Bob has already made several counteroffers and is getting closer to his ideal price, but it's likely Alice will not go lower. Since Bob has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to take that option rather than continue negotiating with Alice. There's no guarantee that Alice will budge, and Bob risks wasting time and possibly running out of rounds without reaching a deal."
