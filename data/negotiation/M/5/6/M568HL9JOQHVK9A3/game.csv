"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is certainly a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000.  This reflects its potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I still think $1,225,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your perspective on the value, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to agree to $1,187,500. This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1187500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the negotiations so far, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
