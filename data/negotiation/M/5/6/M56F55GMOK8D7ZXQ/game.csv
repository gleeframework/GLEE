"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $125 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $132.50. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $132.50 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $128. I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's see if we can close this deal.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $128 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $131. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",131.0,Alice,5,
