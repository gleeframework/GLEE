"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $9,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can definitely do better than $9,000.  He should reject the offer and try to get a lower price.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $8,750. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already negotiated Alice down from $9,000 to $8,750. While he could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and forcing him to buy from John at $12,000 is too high. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it saves him $3,250 compared to buying from John."
