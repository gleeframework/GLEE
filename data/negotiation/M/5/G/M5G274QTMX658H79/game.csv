"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $9,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get us closer to a deal.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $8,750. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you place on the product.",8750.0,Alice,3,
