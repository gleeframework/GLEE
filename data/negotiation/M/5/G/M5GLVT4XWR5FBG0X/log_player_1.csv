Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000) allows you to gauge Bob's level of interest and potentially secure a much higher profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, it opens up a negotiation where you can gradually lower the price, still aiming to secure a deal significantly above your minimum.

**Important:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer. If Bob knew about John, he'd have no incentive to offer more than $1,000,000."
