Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I believe it's a worthwhile investment, but I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or concerns."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to start with a price higher than that to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and exclusivity (""unique value,"" ""initially proposing""). This can make a higher price more palatable.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** While starting high, I don't want to completely deter Bob. Leaving room for discussion shows flexibility and might lead to a mutually agreeable price within Bob's possible valuation.

**Important Considerations:**

* I don't want to go too high with my initial offer. While Bob values the product at $8,000, he's unlikely to accept anything significantly exceeding that amount.  
* My tone is polite and professional to foster a positive negotiation environment."
