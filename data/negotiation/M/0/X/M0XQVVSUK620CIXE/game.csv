"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant. I could come down slightly to $1,325,000. This offer reflects its real worth while still leaving room for a beneficial deal.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,325,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
