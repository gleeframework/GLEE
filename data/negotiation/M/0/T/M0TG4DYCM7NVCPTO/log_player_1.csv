Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, while still leaving a significant profit margin. 

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm prepared to negotiate with him or sell to John for my minimum acceptable price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer, hoping to land somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves me a significant profit margin. 

I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's latest offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing a sale completely.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $1,750,000. This secures me a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations or having to sell to John for a lower price."
