"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $15,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation with Alice.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit high for me. How about $13,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is a little too low for me, but I'm open to meeting in the middle. How about $13,500?  I believe this is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. He can get the product for $13,500 from Alice, which is less than the $15,000 he would pay to John. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ending up with John's higher price isn't worth it."
