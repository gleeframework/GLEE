{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $14,000 is lower than Bob's value of $15,000, giving him potential for a good deal.
* **It allows room for negotiation:** You have space to negotiate down if Bob counters, but you're still starting with a strong offer. 

This strategy balances your desire for a high price with the need to be flexible and potentially secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit high for me. How about $13,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $13,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still lower than your desired price point. It's worth pushing for a slightly higher price, especially since Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is a little too low for me, but I'm open to meeting in the middle. How about $13,500?  I believe this is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
