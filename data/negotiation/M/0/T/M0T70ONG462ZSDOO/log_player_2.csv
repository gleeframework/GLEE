"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it to be worth the price of $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, I'm sure she's making a profit by selling it to me for $110. I can get the same product from John for $120, which is still within my budget of $120. I'd rather save $10 and buy it from John.
