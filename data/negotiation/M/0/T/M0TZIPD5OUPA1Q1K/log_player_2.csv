{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to start by trying to negotiate a better price. $900,000 is a good starting point, but we can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $750,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal and hopefully encourages her to come down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

$850,000 is still a bit high, but it's closer to my target price. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 
I'm going to offer $800,000.  This is a compromise between our last offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows I'm willing to meet halfway, but still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, which is good.  We can probably still squeeze a bit more out of her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 810000}
```

I'm going to offer $810,000.  This is a small increase from my last offer but shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and hoping Alice will accept to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to keep negotiating, we're getting close to the end of the rounds and $820,000 is a good price. It's a substantial savings compared to John's price and likely a fair deal for both of us."
