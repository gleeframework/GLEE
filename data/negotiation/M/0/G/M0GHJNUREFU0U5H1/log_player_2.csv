"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  You'd save $50,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **You're still getting a good deal:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and you're getting it for $950,000. 

Even though the product is worth less to Alice ($800,000), it's in her best interest to make a sale and get some profit rather than nothing."
