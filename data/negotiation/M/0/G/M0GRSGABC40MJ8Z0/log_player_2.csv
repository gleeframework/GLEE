"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and Alice's offer is $1,000,000.  This indicates that there is room for negotiation.  It is better to try to get a lower price from Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product for $925,000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for improvement.  It's worth seeing if you can get her down further before going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable paying $875,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $875,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm now willing to sell the product for $900,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You're only $50,000 away from John's offer, so it's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to go up to $890,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close the deal.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now willing to sell the product for $920,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope it's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high. You've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to get you a significantly better price.  It's time to secure the product from John at $800,000 to ensure you get the best deal."
