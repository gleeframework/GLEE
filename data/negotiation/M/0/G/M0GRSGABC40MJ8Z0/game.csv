"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product for $925,000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable paying $875,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
