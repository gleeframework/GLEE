"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is an exceptional value considering its worth of $10,000 to you. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500. This would still be a good deal for you, given your own valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of this, I am willing to consider $9,000 as a fair price for the product, given its value to you and my desire to reach an agreement. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $8,500.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,750. This would be a win-win for both of us, and I believe we can finalize the deal at this price.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I've considered your proposal and am willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $8,875 for the product? This reflects a compromise between our respective positions and could lead to a satisfying conclusion for both parties.",8875.0,Alice,5,
