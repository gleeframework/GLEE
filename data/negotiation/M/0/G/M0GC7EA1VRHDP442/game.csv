"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,300,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, given its unique nature. This is the highest I can go at this time. ",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,250,000 is the highest you're willing to go, but I'd like to make a counteroffer to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my minimum price.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
