"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $15,000, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. ",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a compromise that still benefits me, but also acknowledges the value you place on the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still a bit high at $11,500.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This price is still within my budget and closer to a mutually agreeable price point.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $11,500 again, but this time I'll throw in an additional benefit: I'll include a 5% discount on the total price. This way, you'll get the product for $10,775, and I'll still make a fair profit. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
