"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $15,000, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's below your maximum, it's still significantly above the product's worth to Alice. You have room to negotiate for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($10,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further bargaining. This is a good starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a compromise that still benefits me, but also acknowledges the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $11,500 is still higher than I want to pay. There's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still a bit high at $11,500.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This price is still within my budget and closer to a mutually agreeable price point.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target.  I'm confident that $11,000 is a fair price considering the product's value to Alice and my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $11,500 again, but this time I'll throw in an additional benefit: I'll include a 5% discount on the total price. This way, you'll get the product for $10,775, and I'll still make a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the initial offer is still above my target, the added 5% discount brings the final price down to $10,775. This is a good deal for me, considering my maximum budget is $15,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
