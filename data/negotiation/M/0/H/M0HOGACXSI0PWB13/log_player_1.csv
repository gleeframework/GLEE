Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to haggle. 
* **Strong but Fair:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still potentially appealing compared to losing out on the product entirely."
