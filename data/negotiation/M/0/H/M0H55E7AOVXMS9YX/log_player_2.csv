"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. This product holds significant potential and is worth at least $1500000 to me.  I'm confident it could be even more valuable to the right buyer.  I'm willing to let it go for $1800000. This is a price that reflects both its inherent value and the potential upside it offers.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm not sure I want to pay $1,800,000 for the product, considering it's only worth $1,200,000 to me. I'll reject Alice's offer.
