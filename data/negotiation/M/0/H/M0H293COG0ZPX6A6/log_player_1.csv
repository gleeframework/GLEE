Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully secures a sale without resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can come to a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the first offer, hoping to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  $120 is still a good price for me, but it gives Bob some room to maneuver and hopefully reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm making one final counteroffer to Bob.  $110 is a reasonable compromise, and if he rejects it, I'll be willing to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $105 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not quite there.  I'm going to sell to John for $150 to guarantee a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements."
