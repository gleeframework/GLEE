Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. However,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product. I can do $11000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still a bit above my budget. Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $10,500. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $10500. Let's try to find a sweet spot in between. How about $11250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $11,250 is closer to your target, you can still try to push for a lower price. There's still room to negotiate."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $11,250 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in the game, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $10750. Let's try to find a sweet spot in between. How about $11375? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where the negotiation is taking longer, and while Alice is getting closer to your desired price, she's not quite there yet.  You have a guaranteed deal with John for $15,000. It's probably more efficient to move on and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting your offer again."
