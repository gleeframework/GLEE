"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. However,  $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to offer $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product. I can do $11000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11000 is closer, I'm still a bit above my budget. Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $10500. It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $10500. Let's try to find a sweet spot in between. How about $11250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $11250 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10750. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this agreement.",10750.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're still in the game, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $10750. Let's try to find a sweet spot in between. How about $11375?",11375.0,Alice,7,
