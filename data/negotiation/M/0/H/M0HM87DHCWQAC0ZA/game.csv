"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the product's exceptional qualities, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
