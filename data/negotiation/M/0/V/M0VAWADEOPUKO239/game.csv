"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and offer a significant return on your investment.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a much lower price. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my best offer and reflects the real worth of this product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $2,000,000 is still too far out for me.  I can go up to $1,050,000 if you're willing to negotiate further. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from its true value. I'm willing to consider $1,800,000 as my final offer. This is a substantial reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big jump.  $1,800,000 is too much, but to show I'm serious, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  Would you consider $1,425,000?",1425000.0,Bob,6,
