"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a fair starting point, considering its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe it's a great value, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work. This is a fair compromise, and I truly believe the product will be worth more than this to you in the long run.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider my revised offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,
