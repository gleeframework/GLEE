"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $650,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $650,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $650,000 is tempting, it's simply not enough for me to part with this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  I'm still looking for something closer to $1,000,000.  How about $900,000?  This would allow me to get a decent return on my investment, while still providing you with a fair price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $725,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. It's important to remember that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, and I have a limited number of rounds. I need to push for a better deal with Bob, or move on to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 still leaves me quite a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway again,  let's aim for $800,000. This represents a significant discount from my original price, and it would allow you to acquire the product within your budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
