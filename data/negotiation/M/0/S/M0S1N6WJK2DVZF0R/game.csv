"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $650,000 is tempting, it's simply not enough for me to part with this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  I'm still looking for something closer to $1,000,000.  How about $900,000?  This would allow me to get a decent return on my investment, while still providing you with a fair price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 still leaves me quite a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway again,  let's aim for $800,000. This represents a significant discount from my original price, and it would allow you to acquire the product within your budget. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
