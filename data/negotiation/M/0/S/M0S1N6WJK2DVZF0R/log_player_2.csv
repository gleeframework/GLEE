Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $650,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $650,000 is tempting, it's simply not enough for me to part with this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  I'm still looking for something closer to $1,000,000.  How about $900,000?  This would allow me to get a decent return on my investment, while still providing you with a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 725000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 still leaves me quite a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway again,  let's aim for $800,000. This represents a significant discount from my original price, and it would allow you to acquire the product within your budget. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John since you'll get the same price."
