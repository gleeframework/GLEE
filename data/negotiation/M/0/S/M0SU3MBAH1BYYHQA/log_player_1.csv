{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $90 for it, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that.  I can come down to $98.  That's only a small difference from your last offer, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $98 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $96?  That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $96 is tempting, I'm starting to get frustrated with the negotiations and it's taking longer than I anticipated.  At this point, it's simply more profitable to sell the product to John for $120. I'll thank Bob for his time and move on to the sale with John."
