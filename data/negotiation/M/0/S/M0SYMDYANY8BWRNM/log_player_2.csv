"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum asking price and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,200,000.
