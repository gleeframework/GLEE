Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can secure the product elsewhere for $1,200,000.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
