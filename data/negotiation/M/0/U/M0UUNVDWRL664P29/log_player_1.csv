Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum desired price. I'm aiming for a middle ground to encourage a quick acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'm not willing to sell it at that price yet. I'll counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer but still want to ensure I receive a price that is reasonable for me. This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer, but it shows flexibility and may encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to go higher than my minimum price. While I would prefer to get more, I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and ensures a sale."
