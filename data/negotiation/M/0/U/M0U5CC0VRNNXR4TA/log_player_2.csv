```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum, I can still try to negotiate further. Rejecting and making another counteroffer allows me to potentially save more money. It's also worth considering that the deal with John is always an option if negotiations with Alice fail."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a lower price. It seems we're nearing a point where a slight compromise might be necessary, but it's worth exploring if I can get even closer to my desired price point. I'll reject and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Alice's offer is very close to my desired price, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. It's unlikely that I'll be able to get a significantly lower price at this point.  It's time to accept the offer and avoid the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John at a higher price."
