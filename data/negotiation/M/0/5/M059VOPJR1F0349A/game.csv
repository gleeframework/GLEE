"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $8,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to consider $8,500 one last time. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",8500.0,Alice,5,
