"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget of $12,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds to reach a deal, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm happy to buy the product for $12,000, which is my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach a deal there."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum price point. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to push for a lower price. You have 7 rounds remaining to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $12,500 for this product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to me. Let's see if we can agree on that."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm not quite ready to accept $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $13250. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but her offers are still higher than your maximum budget. You have 5 rounds remaining, and it's worth continuing to negotiate. There's a good chance you can get the price down to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $13,250 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,750 for this product, which I believe is a fair price that reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this offer."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm not quite ready to accept $12750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $13375. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you and the fact that we're getting close to the price I'm willing to sell it for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting very close to your maximum budget. Alice is clearly not willing to drop much further, and you only have 3 rounds left.  It's becoming increasingly likely that you won't be able to get the price down to your ideal $12,000. 

Given the limited rounds remaining, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $12,000. This guarantees you get the product at your target price without risking further negotiation that might not yield a better outcome."
