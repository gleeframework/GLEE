"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm happy to buy the product for $12000, which is my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach a deal there.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $12500 for this product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to me. Let's see if we can agree on that.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm not quite ready to accept $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $13250. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $13250 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12750 for this product, which I believe is a fair price that reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this offer.",12750.0,Bob,6,
