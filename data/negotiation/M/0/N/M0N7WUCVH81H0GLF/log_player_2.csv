"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  $1,600,000 is above your maximum price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,450,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and gives us room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,580,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as I have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1520000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $1,520,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but it's still below her price point.  This should hopefully keep the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,570,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,570,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still being stubborn, but I'm not giving up yet. Her price is still too high, and it's worth trying to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1540000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly again to $1,540,000. This shows Alice I'm serious and willing to compromise, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  We're getting closer, and hopefully she'll accept this time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,555,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,555,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget.  I've already rejected her offer several times, and the risk of losing the product is high. I'm willing to accept her offer of $1,555,000 to secure the deal, even if it means I don't get the absolute best price."
