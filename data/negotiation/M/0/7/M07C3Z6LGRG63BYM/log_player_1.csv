Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1300000} 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,300,000. This leaves some room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit.  I'm confident Bob will find the value of the product worth paying a little extra for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, I'm not convinced he'll go any higher. I'm willing to walk away with a profit of $1,200,000 from John, which is a solid outcome. I'll take the guaranteed deal with John."
