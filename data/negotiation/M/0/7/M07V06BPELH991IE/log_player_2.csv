{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, but $9,000 is still too close to your upper limit. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** You're not desperate to buy from Alice, so you have the option to buy from John if the negotiation fails."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer below Alice's offer:** This shows you're serious about negotiating and willing to compromise.
* **Significant reduction:** A $1,500 drop from Alice's offer is a substantial reduction, demonstrating your commitment to saving money.
* **Still within your budget:** $7,500 is comfortably within your $12,000 limit. 

By making this counteroffer, you aim to push Alice towards a more favorable price while also indicating that you are willing to walk away if she doesn't meet you halfway."

* **Backup option is still available:** Buying from John is a safety net if negotiations fall through.

By rejecting this offer, you show Alice that you're determined to get a better deal. This might encourage her to make a more favorable counteroffer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  Even though it's lower than her previous offer, $9,800 is still close to your upper limit. 
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** You've already used 5 rounds, leaving only 5 more. This means there's less room for back-and-forth negotiation, and you need to be more assertive.
* **John is a viable alternative:** If you can't get a better price, buying from John is a reasonable option. 

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you are serious about finding a more attractive price. This might encourage her to make a more significant concession in the next round, or you can consider buying from John if her offer remains unfavorable."

* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, this counteroffer needs to be a strong compromise. 
* **Potential for Acceptance:**  Alice has been reducing her price, and this offer might be within her acceptable range.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting worse:** Alice is increasing her price instead of lowering it, indicating a lack of willingness to compromise.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** We are approaching the end of the negotiations. This means time is running out and there is a high chance of not reaching an agreement.
* **John's offer is a safe haven:** With John's offer, you are guaranteed to purchase the product for a price within your budget.

It's better to purchase from John than to risk continuing negotiations with Alice. This ensures you get the product within your budget while avoiding further potential loss of time and effort in negotiations."
