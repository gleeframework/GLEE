Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $80, as that's the value I see in it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.
