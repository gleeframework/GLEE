Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the product's ""value"" subtly implies it's worth the higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is friendly and phrases like ""What do you think?"" invite Bob to counter-offer, keeping the conversation going.
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secured with John's $10,000 offer, ensuring I don't lose out."
