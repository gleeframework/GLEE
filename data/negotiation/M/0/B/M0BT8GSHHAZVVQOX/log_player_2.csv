Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I go down to $12,000? This still gives you a great deal and leaves some room for me to make a profit. What do you say?

Alice is getting closer to a price I like, but I think there's still a little wiggle room. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
