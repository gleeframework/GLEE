"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $10,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows you to make a decent profit.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I can cover my costs. How about we meet at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",13000.0,Alice,7,
