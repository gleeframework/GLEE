"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe holds immense value for you. This product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and I am excited to extend this exclusive offer to you at a price that reflects its true worth while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Considering the exceptional quality and the significance of the product to your needs, I propose to sell it to you for $1,150,000. This price not only ensures a fair transaction but also leaves room for negotiation should you find it within your budget constraints.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer or if you require further information about the product. I am here to assist you throughout the process and ensure a seamless purchase experience.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* However, you know John will sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
* There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's first offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. She might come back with a lower offer closer to her own valuation of $1,000,000. 

Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
