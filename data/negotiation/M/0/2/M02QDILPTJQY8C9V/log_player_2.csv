"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product. We're excited to offer it to you at a price of $12000. We believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $12,000 is still too high, and there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further if you buy from John.  Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is closer to my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Alice is coming down, but $10,500 is still higher than my maximum. Let's see if we can get closer to my target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in buying your product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9000. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but $10,000 is still too much. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more, but I'm also considering the possibility of buying from John at this point."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10,000 is still just a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe this is a fair price considering we've both moved from our initial positions. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to make a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9500. I'm willing to meet you at $10250, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Alice is being very stubborn, and the price is still above my maximum. While I'd like to continue negotiating, it's getting close to the end of the rounds. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $8,000. This will save me money in the long run and ensure I get the product."
