"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to feel confident that I'm getting a good deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still believe $900,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I think this price is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",850000.0,Bob,4,
