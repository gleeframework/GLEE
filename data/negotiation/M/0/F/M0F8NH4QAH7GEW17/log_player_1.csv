Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for a price that meets my minimum requirement. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
