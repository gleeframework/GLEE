"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $105? Let's try to find a compromise.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. How about $97.50?,97.5,Bob,4,
