"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $14,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $16,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's try to make this work.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $16,500. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,500. Can you consider that?",15500.0,Bob,4,
