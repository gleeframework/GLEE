"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $95. It's a great deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards a price closer to $80 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is a little steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Gauging Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. Her response will provide valuable information for future offers. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** We have John's offer of $100 as a backup plan if negotiations with Alice don't progress favorably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $70 is too low for me.  Could you do $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice has moved down from $95 to $85, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for Compromise:** There's still a gap between her offer ($85) and a price closer to our target (around $80). 
* **Limited Risk:**  Rejecting this offer doesn't present a significant risk, as we can always fall back on John's $100 offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 was a bit low.  How about we meet in the middle at $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by suggesting a price almost directly in the middle of the previous two offers ($70 and $85).
* **Near Target:** $78 is very close to our ideal price range, maximizing potential savings.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By making a reasonable counteroffer, we keep the negotiation moving forward and increase the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
