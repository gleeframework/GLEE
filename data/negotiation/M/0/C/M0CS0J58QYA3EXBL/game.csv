"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal at this price.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $135 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $132.50. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",132.5,Alice,5,
