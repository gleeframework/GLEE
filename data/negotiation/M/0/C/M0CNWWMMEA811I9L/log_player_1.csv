Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($100) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $95 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate or for me to come down slightly while still staying well above my minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  While I aim for the best price, appearing overly greedy could make Bob walk away. This offer balances profit with the risk of losing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $85. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $85 is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my initial ask, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down by $5 from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help me gauge Bob's price sensitivity. If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects it, I'll have a better sense of his lower limit and can decide whether to negotiate further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still a bit above my budget, how about $87? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Enough Deal:** $87 is a solid profit, exceeding my minimum price by $7. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher amount, the difference is now relatively small.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort.  Accepting this offer brings a good return and avoids prolonging the process. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance Bob might walk away if I push further, leaving me to settle for John's offer of $80. Accepting $87 now secures a good profit and eliminates that risk."
