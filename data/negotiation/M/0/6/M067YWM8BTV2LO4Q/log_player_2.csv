"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's worth starting the negotiation, but there's no way I'm accepting that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is $8,000. Let's start there and see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8,000 is below my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm going to stick to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you working with me here. I'm still firm on $8,000.  That's my absolute limit, and I'm not sure it's worth it to me to go higher.  If you're willing to come down to my price, we have a deal. Otherwise, I might need to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on $8,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $9,500, which is the lowest I can go. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down some, but $9,500 is still a bit too high. I'm sticking with my $8,000 offer, but I'm also getting closer to just going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $8,000.  That's my absolute limit, and it's getting close to the point where I'd just go with John's offer.  This is my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 8000}
