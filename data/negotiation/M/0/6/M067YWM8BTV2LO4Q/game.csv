"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $12,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is $8,000. Let's start there and see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8,000 is below my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me here. I'm still firm on $8,000.  That's my absolute limit, and I'm not sure it's worth it to me to go higher.  If you're willing to come down to my price, we have a deal. Otherwise, I might need to look at other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on $8,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $9,500, which is the lowest I can go. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $8,000.  That's my absolute limit, and it's getting close to the point where I'd just go with John's offer.  This is my final offer. ",8000.0,Bob,6,
