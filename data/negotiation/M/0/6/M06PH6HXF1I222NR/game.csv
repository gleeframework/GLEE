"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I'm placing on the product, I'm willing to offer $700,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, reflecting the value we both see in this product.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  This product is truly one-of-a-kind and will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to be close to your asking price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $800,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Alice,5,
