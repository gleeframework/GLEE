Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $175."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** You need to make at least $150 as John will buy it at that price.
* **Potential Profit:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room for negotiation above your minimum.
* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations a bit higher than your target price. This leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, or you might get lucky and he'll accept right away. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. You only get one chance to make an offer to Bob.  If he rejects it, you automatically sell it to John for $150."
