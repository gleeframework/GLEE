Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  This allows for some wiggle room while still securing a significant profit. 

**Why not start higher?**

While a higher starting price might seem appealing, it could immediately scare Bob away.  Starting with a more reasonable price increases the chances of Bob engaging in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I believe there's still potential to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with a price of $975,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping it closer to my desired price point. This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving while maintaining my leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  The negotiations have reached a point where I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob, and the risk of further negotiation falling apart is high.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, ensuring I get my minimum desired price and guaranteeing the deal."
