"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. He can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make sure I get a decent profit for this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still potentially get a better price by counteroffering again.  He's already shown willingness to negotiate, and Alice has demonstrated flexibility.  There's still room for a deal that's beneficial to both parties."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I get a decent profit for this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $890,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could continue to negotiate, the price is now very close to his ideal price point.  There's a good chance further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price, and he risks losing the deal altogether.  It's a good compromise, and he saves $110,000 compared to buying from John."
