"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but $1,900,000 represents a significant discount on its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still significantly more than I'm looking to spend.  If you're willing to consider $1,100,000, I think we could make a deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some urgency on your end, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  My bottom line is $1,400,000.  This is a firm offer, as it represents a significant compromise from my initial asking price.  Let me know if this works for you.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  I can offer a maximum of $1,150,000.  This is my final offer - I need to make a decision soon. ",1150000.0,Bob,6,
