"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** Even though you value the product at $10,000, Alice's offer of $9,000 saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **It's in your best interest to accept the offer.** While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
