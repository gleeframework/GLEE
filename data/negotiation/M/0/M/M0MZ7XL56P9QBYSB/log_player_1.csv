I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.
