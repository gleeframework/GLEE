"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still not quite in my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product.  I think this price reflects the value to both of us and gives us both a fair deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to let go of the product at $900,000. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",925000.0,Alice,5,
