"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a good bargaining position because you have an alternative seller (John) who is willing to sell for your maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you have John as a backup, you can start with your maximum price. This will make it clear that you're serious about getting the product but are also pushing for the best possible deal. Alice might accept, or she might counter. Either way, you've set a strong starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You are still better off rejecting her offer and trying to negotiate a lower price.  You have a strong bargaining position with John as an alternative seller."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but her offer is still too high.  A counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's above your maximum price with John, but it gives Alice some room to lower her price and still make a profit. It also shows that you're serious about buying the product but won't be taken advantage of."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's risky to accept as she might drop her price even further if you reject. Continue to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your target price. You have John as a backup, so you don't need to rush into a deal that's not in your best interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but her offer is still slightly above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. By offering $1,200,000 you are trying to meet her halfway, indicating your seriousness about buying the product while also testing her willingness to make a further concession. If she rejects, you can still walk away and buy from John."
