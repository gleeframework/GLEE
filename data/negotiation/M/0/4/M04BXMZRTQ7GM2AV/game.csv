"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value and market conditions.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,800,000 is a strong offer, I believe the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $2,100,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the product's value and potential, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to move forward with the purchase.",1950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I see the value you place in this product, and I want to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $2,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its true worth.",2025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and potential, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
