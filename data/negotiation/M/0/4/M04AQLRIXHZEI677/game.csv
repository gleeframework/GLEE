"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm only able to go up to $1,200,000 at this time. This is a great product, but it's important that we find a price that works for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. This is a competitive price that still allows you to make a profit while also being fair to me. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which would allow you a good return on your investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
