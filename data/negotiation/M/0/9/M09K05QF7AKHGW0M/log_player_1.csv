Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated. However,  $1,450,000 is still a significant stretch. To be frank, I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other options available if we can't reach an agreement.

Bob's final offer is still significantly below my minimum, and his tone suggests he won't budge much further. John's offer guarantees my desired outcome, so it's the most logical choice at this point."
