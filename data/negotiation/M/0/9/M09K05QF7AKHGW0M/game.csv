"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I do see value in the product, the price point you've presented is significantly above what I've budgeted. I'd be willing to consider purchasing the product for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than the value I place on this product.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a number closer to my initial ask.  Would you consider $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget. I could potentially stretch to $1,150,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my strong interest in acquiring the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget.  To meet you closer to the middle, I'd be willing to accept $1,450,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated. However,  $1,450,000 is still a significant stretch. To be frank, I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other options available if we can't reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
