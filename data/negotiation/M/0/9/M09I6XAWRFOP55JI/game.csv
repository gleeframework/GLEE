,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. Can you consider that?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your counteroffer, but $20,000 is already a competitive price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to counteroffer at $16,000. Can you consider that?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your negotiations, but $16,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I could do $16,750, but that's my absolute best offer.",16750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd like to counteroffer at $16,000 again. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay under $16,000. Can you reconsider?",16000.0,Bob,6,
