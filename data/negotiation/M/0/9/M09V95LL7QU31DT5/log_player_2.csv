"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product. We're excited to discuss the details with you. As a starting point, we're willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your flexibility, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm happy to proceed with negotiations but I'd like to offer you $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. We believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above what he's willing to pay at this moment.  Bob has a safety net with John's offer, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000 for the product. This price is a good compromise, and it allows for both of us to walk away with a successful deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We appreciate your persistence. After careful consideration, we're willing to reduce our price to $1,075,500. This is a small concession, but we believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his goal of $1,000,000.  He can potentially save a significant amount by continuing to negotiate.  While Alice is likely unwilling to go much lower, it's worth a few more rounds to see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit further.  I understand we are close to a deal, but I'm going to propose $1,055,000.  This price is still a good value for you, and it gets me closer to my target.  Let's see if we can find a happy medium here."", ""product_price"": 1055000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're not willing to go any lower than $1,070,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and we believe it's a fair compromise considering the negotiations so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been pushing hard to get the price down, but Alice's counter-offer of $1,070,000 is still outside of Bob's ideal range.  With only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a significantly lower price.  The guaranteed deal with John at $1,000,000 provides a known and better outcome, so Bob should take advantage of that."
