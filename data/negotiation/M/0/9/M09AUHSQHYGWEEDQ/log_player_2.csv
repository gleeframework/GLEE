Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering our respective valuations. I'm hopeful we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad to hear that we're making progress, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I would like to suggest a price of $1,125,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value you see in it and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is within my budget and closer to my target price than what John is offering. Accepting this offer saves me $375,000 compared to buying from John. While I could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal, and there's a risk of Alice walking away or me running out of rounds. It's better to secure the product now at a reasonable price."
