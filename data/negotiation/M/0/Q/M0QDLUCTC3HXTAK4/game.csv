"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget considerations, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. Would you consider $12,500?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring you a significant return on your investment.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $11,250. I'm confident that this product will be valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints.",11250.0,Bob,4,
