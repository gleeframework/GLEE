"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit tight for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you place on it. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get the price down.  There's still a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and I don't want to miss out on potentially saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I believe this is a fair price, considering your own valuation of the product and my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $10,500. I can offer you a slight compromise at $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While I'm close to agreeing, I don't want to risk pushing further and potentially losing the deal entirely. It's better to accept John's offer and get the product at my desired price point."
