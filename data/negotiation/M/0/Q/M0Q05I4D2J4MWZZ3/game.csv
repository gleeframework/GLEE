"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit tight for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you place on it. Let me know if this works for you!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I believe this is a fair price, considering your own valuation of the product and my budget constraints.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $10,500. I can offer you a slight compromise at $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if this works for you!",11250.0,Alice,5,
