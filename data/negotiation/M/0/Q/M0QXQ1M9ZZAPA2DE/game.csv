"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value, I'm not quite ready to come down that much. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,350,000.  This price reflects the value you've mentioned, while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
