I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my desired price as possible, but I'm also willing to accept John's offer of $8,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
