Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially secure a good price.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not yet satisfied. I believe I can potentially get a better price by counter-offering. I'll aim for a price between $900,000 and my initial offer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $950,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
