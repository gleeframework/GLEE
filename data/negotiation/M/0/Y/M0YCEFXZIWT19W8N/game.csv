"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and your budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference at $1,075,000.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
