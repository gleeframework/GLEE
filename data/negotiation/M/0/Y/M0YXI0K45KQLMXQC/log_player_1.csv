Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the asking price of $2,300,000."", ""product_price"": 2300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** I'm beginning with a significantly higher price than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception that the product is highly sought after.
* **Gauge the Waters:** This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.  His response will give me valuable information about his willingness to pay. 
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,500,000 gives me a strong fallback position and allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counter-offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he's expressing interest, accepting $1,200,000 would be a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially knowing John provides a safety net at $1,500,000.  It's time to counter and steer the negotiation closer to a price that benefits me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $2,300,000 reflects that accurately. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering the product's unique advantages. "", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** I'm making a substantial drop in price to demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, the new offer remains comfortably above my $1,500,000 minimum and positions me closer to the initial ask.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique advantages"" of the product, I'm reinforcing its value and justifying the price, even with the reduction.
* **Pressure:**  This counter-offer puts some pressure on Bob.  He's aware I'm willing to negotiate, but the significant drop also suggests I'm serious about obtaining a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,400,000 is now above my safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000. While I could likely push for a slightly higher price in further rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away.  Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
