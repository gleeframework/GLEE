"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $2,300,000 reflects that accurately. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering the product's unique advantages. ",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
