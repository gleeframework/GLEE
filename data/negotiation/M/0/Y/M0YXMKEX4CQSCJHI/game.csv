"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $11000? This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than its value to you. Let's try to find a middle ground!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10750 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about $10900? This is a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. Let me know what you think!",10900.0,Alice,5,
