"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10000? This would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
