This investment could potentially yield substantial returns based on its market value and the benefits it offers. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if there's any way I can assist you in understanding how this product could meet your specific needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's price.  As Bob, my goal is to save money. Since there's no advantage to buying from Alice, I'll reject her offer and move forward with John."
