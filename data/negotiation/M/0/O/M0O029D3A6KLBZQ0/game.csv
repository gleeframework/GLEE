"Bob, I believe this product offers exceptional value, and I'm happy to discuss it further with you. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  That price is a bit high for me, so I'm proposing $800,000. This offer represents a significant saving for you compared to finding another buyer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still a ways off from that price. To keep this moving, how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  To be frank,  $950,000 is too low for me to consider.  I can go as low as $1,200,000. I believe that's my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  I can do $1,050,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering the value and will allow us to close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting close. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is really pushing my limit.  My final offer is $1,125,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
