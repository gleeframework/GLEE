# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product offers exceptional value, and I'm happy to discuss it further with you. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.

Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  To be frank,  $950,000 is too low for me to consider.  I can go as low as $1,200,000. I believe that's my final offer.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting close. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is really pushing my limit.  My final offer is $1,125,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is firmly set above $1,100,000. While there's a chance she could be bluffing, it's a risky gamble with only a few rounds left. Accepting her ""final"" offer at $1,125,000 eats into our savings significantly.  Buying from John guarantees the product at our target price and eliminates further negotiation risk."
