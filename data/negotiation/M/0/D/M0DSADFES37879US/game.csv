,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to take it for $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $107.50.  What do you say?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but $107.50 is still too low.  How about we meet at $109?  I think we're both getting closer to a deal here.",109.0,Alice,5,
