Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the product's true value is closer to my initial price. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I think I can do better than that. How about $1,150,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While I could push for more, accepting at $1,150,000 is a strong return and avoids the risk of Bob dropping out of the negotiation.  It's a significant profit above my minimum."
