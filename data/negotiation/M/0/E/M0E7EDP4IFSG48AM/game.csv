"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm keen to buy this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Could we work around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, that's closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $800,000? It's a fair price and we can both walk away happy.",800000.0,Bob,4,
