Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a bit of a discount while still allowing you to make a decent profit. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This makes it more likely Bob will accept the offer, avoiding the need for counteroffers.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly in a counteroffer. 

By keeping your minimum in mind, you can make calculated offers that give you the best chance of a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum value of $12,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if you can reach a more profitable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
