Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to take $10,200, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try to counteroffer again and see if we can find a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to do the same. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,750. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is the same as what John is offering. Since we're running out of rounds, it's not worth risking a lower price. I'm going to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $10,000."
