Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aim for a price that gives you the most profit while still being enticing to Bob. Offering it slightly below his perceived value increases your chance of a successful sale.

The offer of $925,000 leaves room for Bob to still gain a significant $75,000 in value while netting you a $125,000 profit over your alternative deal."
