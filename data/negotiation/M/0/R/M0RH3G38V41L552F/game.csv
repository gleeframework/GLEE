"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10800.0,Alice,3,
