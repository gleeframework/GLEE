"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.

Bob should reject the offer. While it's better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to save even more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This price is lower than John's and is only $300 more than Bob's counteroffer. It's a good deal, and further negotiation might not lead to a significantly better price."
