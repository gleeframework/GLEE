"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is my maximum, there's no reason to immediately accept Alice's offer. By rejecting, I can try to negotiate a lower price. It's possible Alice is willing to sell for less than my maximum, and I have 9 rounds left to find out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and helps gauge her willingness to compromise. If she rejects, I have room to adjust my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still too high. I can try to get closer to my target price by counter-offering again. I have 7 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $10,500.  This shows Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm still aiming for a good deal.  It's a smaller increment than my first counteroffer, suggesting I'm getting closer to my limit. If she rejects, I can still adjust my offer in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still hesitant to accept. I have 5 rounds left, and there's still potential to get a lower price.  I want to see if Alice is willing to drop further before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but this time by a smaller margin. This shows Alice I'm getting closer to my limit, but still holding out for a better price.  At this point, I'm hoping Alice will recognize that I'm unlikely to go much higher and accept my offer. If she rejects, I can still adjust my offer in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is only $250 above my previous offer.  This is a significant concession from her side, and I'm confident I won't be able to negotiate a much lower price.  With only 3 rounds left, it's time to accept the offer and avoid risking the deal falling through. This secures the product at a price within my budget and saves me from having to buy from John."
