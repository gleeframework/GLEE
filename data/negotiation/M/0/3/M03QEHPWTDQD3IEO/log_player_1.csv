"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that my product is worth more to me than to Bob. I'm hoping to leverage my bargaining power and see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, we'll see where the negotiation goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm still not at my minimum price point. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more with Bob and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to stick with my minimum price point. I'm confident that the product is worth this much to me, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in it. If he doesn't, I can always fall back on John's offer."
