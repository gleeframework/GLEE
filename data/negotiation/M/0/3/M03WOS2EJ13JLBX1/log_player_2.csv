"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a tough one.  Alice's offer is way too high.  The best move is to reject and see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get it for $100,  $125 is still within my budget and a better deal than going with John. It's time to accept the offer."
