{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150), but it's still a good profit margin for me. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more than $80, which is what he thinks it's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to give the product away. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $100 is just too low for me. How about $115? That's still a great price for the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the reduction, but I would like to propose $105 as my maximum offer for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum price than Bob's previous offer, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially get a lower price. John is a guaranteed sale for $150, which is a much better deal for me."
