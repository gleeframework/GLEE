"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $10,000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I can't go all the way down to $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This gives you a good deal, and still allows me to recoup some of my investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,
