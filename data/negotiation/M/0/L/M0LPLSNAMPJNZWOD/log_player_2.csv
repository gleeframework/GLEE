"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, taking into account the worth of the product and your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $700,000. Considering the value it holds, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, taking into account the worth of the product and your previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below your backup price of $800,000. It's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John."
