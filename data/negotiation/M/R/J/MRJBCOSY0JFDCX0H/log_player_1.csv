"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Knowing its value, I'm initially setting the price at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a significantly higher price than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the ""incredible"" nature of the product and its ""true worth and potential,"" I aim to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.  
* **Leaving John as Leverage:**  The option to sell to John for my minimum price acts as a safety net. I won't accept any offer significantly below what John guarantees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than my initial ask and well below what I believe I can get. Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Demonstrate Firmness:** Showing I'm not going to immediately fold when my initial price is rejected.
* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:**  His counteroffer was a substantial jump from his perceived value, suggesting he's quite interested.  I want to see how much further he's willing to move. 
* **Keep John as Leverage:** I'm still comfortably above my ""walk-away"" price, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  While $2,300,000 represents my initial assessment, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise and recognizes the product's unique capabilities."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've lowered my price by $200,000, which is a significant amount designed to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still holding firm above the $2 million mark.
* **Justification:**  I'm framing the price reduction as a ""compromise"" rather than a reflection of an inflated initial price. I'm continuing to emphasize the product's unique qualities to justify the high value. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** I want to keep the negotiation moving and encourage Bob to respond with another offer.  I'm hoping he'll make a significant move towards my price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Walk-Away:** While $1,900,000 is getting closer, it's still a significant amount away from my target and above my safety net with John. 
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** Bob's increments are getting smaller ($100,000 this time). I need to see if he's truly committed or getting ready to concede. 
* **Maintaining Control:** I want to avoid appearing overly eager. By rejecting, I signal I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a price that reflects the value I place on the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're getting closer.  To find middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This feels like a fair offer considering the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm now at a clean $2,000,000, a psychological price point that might be more appealing to Bob.
* **Smaller Concession:** My price drop is now only $100,000.  This shows I'm serious but also getting closer to my limit.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm reiterating the product's value while emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the offer to encourage Bob to agree. 
* **Time Consideration:** With half the rounds gone, I need to start nudging Bob towards a decision while still leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I'm getting closer to accepting, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Point:**  We're getting into the later rounds, and Bob is still holding back. I need to apply some pressure to see if he's willing to move closer to $2 million.
* **Minimal Movement:** His offer only increased by $50,000. This suggests he might be nearing his limit but also testing my resolve. 
* **Calculated Risk:** While I risk him walking away, I'm betting he wants the product enough to make a more substantial offer in the next round or two. I'm still above my walk-away price with John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but to be completely transparent,  $2,000,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go on this.  This product is truly one-of-a-kind, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  What do you say we close this deal now?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm drawing a line in the sand.  By stating this is my absolute lowest, I signal the end of the negotiation is near.
* **Creating Urgency:**  I'm using phrases like ""close this deal now"" to encourage a decision without being overly aggressive.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm giving a final reminder of the product's unique value and potential to sweeten the deal for Bob.
* **Time Factor:**  With only three rounds left, I need Bob to understand the seriousness of my position and make a move. I'm still prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's uniqueness, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has gone back down to his offer from Round 4 and declared it his ""final offer."" This suggests he's not willing to meet me closer to my $2,000,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob walking away completely.  Even if I could get him slightly higher, it's unlikely to be a significant jump at this point.
* **Guaranteed Value:** John's offer of $1,500,000 represents a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement. 
* **Time Saved:**  Selling to John avoids the potential for further stalemates and allows me to move forward without wasting more time on a negotiation that's unlikely to yield a significantly better result."
