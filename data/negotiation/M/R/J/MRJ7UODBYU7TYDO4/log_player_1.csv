Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know you'll find great value in it."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a strong fallback position. This allows Alice to be more confident in her offer to Bob."
