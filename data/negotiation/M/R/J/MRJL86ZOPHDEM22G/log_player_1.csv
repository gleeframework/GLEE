"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $11,500. This is a fair price that's closer to my budget and hopefully works for you as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it's going to be a slow climb to reach even $12,000.  John offers a guaranteed $12,000 with no further negotiation. It makes the most business sense to take the guaranteed offer at this point."
