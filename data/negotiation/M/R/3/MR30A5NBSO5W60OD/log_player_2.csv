"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll really love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its unique features and benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Since you are willing to pay $12,000 for the product from John, there is no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price. You can try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, or wait to see if she lowers the price."
