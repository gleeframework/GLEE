Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but my initial price reflects the true value and potential of this product.  Let's find a middle ground: I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer takes into account the unique benefits it offers and ensures a fair deal for both of us.

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still too high. You should reject the offer and counter with a lower price again.  You're trying to get as close to your $800,000 budget as possible."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a workable figure.  To be completely transparent,  $1,500,000 is the very lowest I can go while still honoring the value of this product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?

Alice's final offer is still above your budget. While the product might be worth more to her, you're not willing to pay that much.  It's better to go with John and get the product at your target price."
