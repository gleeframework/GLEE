"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. Would you be willing to go up to $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.
