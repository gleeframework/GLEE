"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. Would you be willing to go up to $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $10,250. Would you be willing to consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
