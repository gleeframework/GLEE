``` 

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $875,000 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has repeated the same offer twice, suggesting he might not be willing to go higher. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of losing Bob altogether and having to settle for John's offer.  

While there's a slim chance of pushing Bob a little higher, the risk of losing him and getting a lower price outweighs the potential reward at this point."
