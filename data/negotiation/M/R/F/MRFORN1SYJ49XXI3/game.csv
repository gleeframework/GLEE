"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad you think the product is valuable. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000 is my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. How about we compromise at $875,000? This is as low as I can go.",875000.0,Alice,5,
