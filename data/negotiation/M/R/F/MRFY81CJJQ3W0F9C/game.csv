"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $1,250,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to your business.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay at $1,240,000.  Let's get this deal done.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1240000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,225,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1,235,000 is the maximum I can go. Can you consider this price?",1235000.0,Bob,6,
