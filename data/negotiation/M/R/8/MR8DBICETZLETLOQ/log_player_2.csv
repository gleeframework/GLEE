"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you might be interested in. It's a high-quality item that I'm looking to sell. I'm willing to let it go for $120. Would you like to take a look? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice is offering the product at your maximum price point of $120, it makes sense to accept her offer. You're not losing any money compared to buying from John, and you might be getting a better deal if Alice's valuation of the product is lower."
