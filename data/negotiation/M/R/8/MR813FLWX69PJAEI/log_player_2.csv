Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows you to make a significant profit, and it's closer to what the product is worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
