"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a strong opening offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiating, but I believe this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider coming down to $1,100,000? I think that would be a fair price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,300,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is already a significant discount from my original price, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
