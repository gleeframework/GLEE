"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more.  I'm hoping Bob will either accept or counter with a price closer to my target. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and gradually lower my price if necessary. However, I'll keep in mind the value of the product to me and the possibility of selling to John for $12,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through.  I'll also be paying close attention to Bob's counteroffers to try and gauge his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations in hopes of getting a better offer.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation. My goal is to find a middle ground between my value and what Bob is willing to pay.  I'll also consider how many rounds I have left before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counter-offering with $15,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum value of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise given Bob's low counteroffer, and I'm hoping he sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me halfway.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to gradually lower my price while still staying above my minimum value. I'm trying to find a balance between getting the best possible price and avoiding a stalemate that would force me to sell to John. I'll carefully monitor Bob's reactions to my offers and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly my minimum value.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's a fair price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  

**Strategy:**

I've managed to get to my minimum value in only 4 rounds.  Continuing to negotiate could risk a stalemate or a lower offer. Accepting this offer ensures I get a reasonable price without the potential for further losses."
