{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems stuck on offers above $9,000 and has even regressed in her negotiations. With her stating this is her final offer, it's unlikely she'll move closer to your desired price range. It's better to cut your losses and secure the product from John for $12,000 than risk a stalemate with Alice and potentially miss out on the product entirely."
