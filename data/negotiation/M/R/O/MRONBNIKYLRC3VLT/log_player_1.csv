Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it valuable, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures a significant profit for you.
* **Create Urgency:**  By implying the price is competitive, it might nudge Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $149. He might try to negotiate lower, or simply reject the offer knowing his own valuation is $100. However, this strategy maximizes your chances of a high sale price."
