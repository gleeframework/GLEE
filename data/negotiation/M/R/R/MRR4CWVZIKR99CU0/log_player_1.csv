I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a good compromise as it's less than my minimum acceptable price but still higher than Bob's maximum value.  This gives Bob a chance to get a good deal, while I still earn a significant amount. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000."
