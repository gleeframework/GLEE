"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,200,000 is below Bob's maximum, it's still higher than Alice's minimum. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above Alice's minimum. This shows Bob's willingness to negotiate but also sets a strong starting point.  It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it establishes a lower price range for future negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still too high. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can secure a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and Bob can use his remaining negotiation power to try and get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still remaining below Alice's offer. This is a strategic move to close the gap and hopefully get Alice to accept. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price, but it's getting closer.  It's a good sign that Alice is willing to negotiate further. Bob should continue to negotiate to try and secure a lower price. He has several rounds remaining, and there's a good chance he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,110,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing a willingness to compromise while still remaining below Alice's offer. This is a strategic move to close the gap and hopefully get Alice to accept.  The offer is close to Alice's latest offer and increases the chances of a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,120,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer and is well within his budget. It's likely that further negotiations won't result in a significantly lower price, and there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away. With only a few rounds left, it's more beneficial for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
