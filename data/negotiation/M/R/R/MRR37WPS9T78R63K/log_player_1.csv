Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $119. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really keen, potentially earning you even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting high but not ridiculously so (e.g., $200) makes the offer seem more serious and the product more desirable. 

It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer knowing his own valuation is much lower. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of either:

1. **Bob Surprisingly Accepts:** You get the highest possible price.
2. **You Move to John:** You sell at your guaranteed price without wasting time on low offers."
