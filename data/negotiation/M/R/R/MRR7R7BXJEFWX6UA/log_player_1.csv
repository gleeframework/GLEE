Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something you've had your eye on and it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below Bob's perceived value ($800,000) creates a sense of urgency and a good deal for him. 
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly pressures Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
