"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested but $60 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This still gives you a great deal on a product that's worth a lot more.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer but $90 is still a bit much for my budget. How about $70? That's a fair price.",70.0,Bob,4,
