"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given its value to me, I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This represents a significant saving for you and keeps the deal within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. While $950,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value this product brings.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which is a significant savings for you and keeps us both in a good position.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
