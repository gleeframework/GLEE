Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible, while still exceeding her minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum gives him the impression of a deal and leaves room for potential counter-offers. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
