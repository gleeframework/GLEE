Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize the product's value to make Bob more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message is open to negotiation, indicating I'm willing to work with Bob to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

This approach balances maximizing my profit with keeping the negotiation open and engaging."
