"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate the negotiation. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $150? I'm sure we can work something out.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $150 is just a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $165? That way we both get a good deal.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $165 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $160, which is a fair compromise. Let's close the deal at that price.",160.0,Bob,4,
