{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's advantageous for me, but still leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer if he wants. This allows me to potentially earn more than the $8,000 I'd get from John, while also keeping the negotiation open and flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $8,500? That's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's becoming clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  It's time to move on and secure the sale with John for $8,000."
