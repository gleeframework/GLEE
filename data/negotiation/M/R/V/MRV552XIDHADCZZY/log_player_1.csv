Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $7,000? That would work much better for me.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $10,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $8,500? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and while $8,500 is a decent price, I have a guaranteed offer for $12,000 from John. It makes more financial sense to take the sure thing and maximize my profit."
