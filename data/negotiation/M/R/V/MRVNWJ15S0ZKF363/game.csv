"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
