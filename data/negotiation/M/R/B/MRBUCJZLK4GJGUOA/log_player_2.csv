# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is closer to his target price, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to lower the price further."
