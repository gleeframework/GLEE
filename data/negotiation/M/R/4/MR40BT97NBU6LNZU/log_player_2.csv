"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120. Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $120."
