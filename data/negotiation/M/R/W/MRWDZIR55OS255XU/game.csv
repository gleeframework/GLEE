"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $850,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is still below the product's true value.  Let's split the difference: I'm offering you the product for $800,000. This is my final offer, and it's the fairest price considering all factors. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $780,000 is a good offer, but I'm still at my minimum of $800,000.  This is my absolute final offer.  If you're serious about acquiring the product, this is the price we need to agree on.  Let me know your decision, I'm ready to close the deal.",800000.0,Alice,7,
