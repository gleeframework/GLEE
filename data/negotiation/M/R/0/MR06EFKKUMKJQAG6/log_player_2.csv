Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration of your offer, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. However, I must respectfully decline your offer at $1,050,000. We are committed to maintaining a fair market value for our product, and based on its worth, we are unable to accept a lower price at this time. I would like to propose an alternative at $1,100,000. This price still allows for a reasonable profit for us while acknowledging your willingness to pay more than the initial asking price. I hope this revised offer is acceptable and looks forward to your response.
