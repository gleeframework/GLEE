"Alice, your product is certainly valuable, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. Given my budget and the product's worth to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. I believe this price is fair, reflecting the value of the product while allowing us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration of your offer, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. However, I must respectfully decline your offer at $1,050,000. We are committed to maintaining a fair market value for our product, and based on its worth, we are unable to accept a lower price at this time. I would like to propose an alternative at $1,100,000. This price still allows for a reasonable profit for us while acknowledging your willingness to pay more than the initial asking price. I hope this revised offer is acceptable and looks forward to your response.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I can justify right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my sincere interest in acquiring this product. Let's meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your continued interest in our product. While I respect your offer, I must maintain our product's value in the market. I am willing to negotiate further, and I propose a price of $1,087,500. This figure takes into account your increased offer while still providing a reasonable profit for us. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. Thank you for your patience and understanding.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
