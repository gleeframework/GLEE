"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I know it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and also less than what John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000."
