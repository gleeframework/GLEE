"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, there's still room to negotiate. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $13,500? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
