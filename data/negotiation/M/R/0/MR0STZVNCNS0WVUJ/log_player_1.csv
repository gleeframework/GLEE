Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $8,500, I think I can get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. Can you do $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I want to see if Bob is willing to go a bit higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $8,900?  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good value for you given the product's worth. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8900}
