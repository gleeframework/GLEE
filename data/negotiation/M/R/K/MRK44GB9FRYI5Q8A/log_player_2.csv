"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're proposing a price of $100 for it. We understand its worth to you might be higher, but we hope this offer presents an attractive opportunity. Looking forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $100.** This is within your budget of $120.
* **Buying from John would cost you $120.**  This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, it makes more sense to accept Alice's offer and save $20."
