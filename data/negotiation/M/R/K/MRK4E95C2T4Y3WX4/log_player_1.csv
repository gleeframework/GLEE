I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000.  This gives me a healthy margin over my minimum acceptable price, while still potentially being attractive to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll counter with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000. This is still a good price for me, and it might be more attractive to Bob.  If he's serious about buying, he'll need to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product at such a significant discount. I'm going to make another counteroffer.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, so I may need to consider selling to him if Bob doesn't come up in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $900,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it will be enough to get Bob to accept.  If he rejects this offer, I'm seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to keep going back and forth.  I'm going to sell to John, as his offer is much more favorable."
