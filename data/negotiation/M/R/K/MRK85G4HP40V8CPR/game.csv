"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but $10,250 is still a bit below my minimum. How about we compromise one last time at $10,400? This is a fair offer that gets us both closer to what we want. Let me know if you're willing to go for it.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit short on budget, and $10,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,200, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll consider it a good deal.",10200.0,Bob,6,
