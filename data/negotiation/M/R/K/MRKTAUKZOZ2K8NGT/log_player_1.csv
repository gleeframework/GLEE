"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,500,000. I believe it's a steal for what it can do. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum value to leave room for negotiation and potentially get closer to my ideal sale price.
* **Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for a good deal. 
* **First Round:** In the first round, I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the negotiation game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, his message indicates a genuine interest in the product. This means there is room for negotiation.
* **More Rounds:**  We have 10 rounds total, and I have no guarantee that selling to John will yield a better price. There's value in continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand $1,500,000 might be a stretch. However, considering the value and potential of this product, I can't go lower than $1,350,000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I provide a rationale for my counteroffer, highlighting the value and potential of the product. 
* **Middle Ground:** I frame it as a compromise, suggesting we meet halfway, increasing the chances of Bob accepting. 
* **Time Management:**  With limited rounds, I want to quickly move towards a deal if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. While there's a chance he'll move closer with further negotiation, it's too risky to accept this offer.
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John at $1,200,000 is a guaranteed profit that meets my minimum requirements. However, I still have rounds left to negotiate with Bob.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I want to see if I can push Bob higher. If his counteroffers continue to be low, I can always switch to John.

**Next Step:** I will counter Bob's offer with a higher price, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but $950,000 is still a bit too far from what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $1,150,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the potential value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway Again:**  This emphasizes flexibility and a willingness to compromise, even if it's a small step.
* **Fair Price Argument:**  Reiterating the value of the product and framing my offer as ""fair"" increases the chance of acceptance.
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, I need to push for a deal that is closer to my minimum acceptable value.

**Outcome:** My goal is to push Bob towards a price closer to my desired range. If he continues to offer prices far below, I'll start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has value, but $1150000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  While it's closer than previous offers, it's not yet a deal I'm willing to accept.
* **Selling to John:**  I'm getting close to the point where selling to John for $1,200,000 becomes a more attractive option. However, I still have a few rounds to see if I can push Bob higher.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob has shown a willingness to raise his offer, and there's a chance I can get him closer to my desired price with another counteroffer. 

**Next Step:**  I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's still above my minimum but reflects a willingness to move closer to his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  While I can't go as low as $1,000,000, I'm willing to drop the price to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Agreement:**  My counteroffer is a compromise that signals my willingness to negotiate. It's still above my minimum but demonstrates flexibility.
* **Emphasis on Discount:**  I highlight the discount offered to make the price more appealing to Bob.
* **Urgency:**  With only a few rounds left, I emphasize the need to finalize the deal.

**Outcome:**  If Bob accepts, I'll secure a good deal. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to push further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but $1100000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is high. 
* **Offer Too Low:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit that meets my minimum requirements.  While I would prefer a higher price, the certainty of a sale outweighs the potential of further negotiation with Bob.  

**Conclusion:**  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
