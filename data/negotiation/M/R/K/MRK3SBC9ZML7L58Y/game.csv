"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a rare and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll be impressed with its features and benefits. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $900000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Can you meet me at that price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad to hear that you're enthusiastic about it. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $850000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit higher than $850000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $775000. Can you meet me at that price?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit higher than my previous offer, Bob, and I'm willing to continue the negotiation. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I can offer it to you for $825000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to give you a bit more flexibility.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $820000, which is just $25000 above your last offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I don't leave money on the table.",820000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $790000, Bob. I think we've already compromised significantly, and I need to prioritize getting a good price for the product. I can offer it to you for $815000, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still a reasonable compromise. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options.",815000.0,Alice,9,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to make one final offer of $795000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",795000.0,Bob,10,
