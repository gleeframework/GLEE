""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. What do you think?"",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice's goal is to maximize profit. While she has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * **For Bob:** He gets the product for $150,000 less than its worth to him.
    * **For Alice:** She earns $150,000 more than her guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, still leaving Alice with the potential to earn more than $1,200,000."
