"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000, which is still a good value for this product. I'm confident you won't regret it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $10,500 is still a bit short of what I need to make this worthwhile. How about $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to go down to $11,200, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",11200.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $11,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,900 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",10900.0,Bob,8,
