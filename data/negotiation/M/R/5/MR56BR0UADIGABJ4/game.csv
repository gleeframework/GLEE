"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",105.0,Alice,3,
