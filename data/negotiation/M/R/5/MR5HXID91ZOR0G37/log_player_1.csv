Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he wouldn't rationally pay more.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The range where a deal can happen is between $1,200,001 (one dollar more than Bob values it) and $1,499,999 (one dollar less than your guaranteed offer).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, but there are a few things to consider:

* **Bob's Information:** Does Bob know you have another buyer? If so, he's less likely to negotiate up. 
* **Relationship:** Is a future relationship with Bob valuable? A more aggressive offer might sour that.

**The Offer**

Given the information, here's a balanced approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Justifiable:**  This offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests you're open to discussing the price, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** If you believe Bob is unaware of your other offer and prioritize maximizing your profit above a potential relationship, you could start higher (closer to $1,499,999). However, this increases the risk of Bob rejecting outright."
