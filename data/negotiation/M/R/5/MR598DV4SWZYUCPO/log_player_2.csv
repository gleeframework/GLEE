"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point. You can likely get a better price than $130, especially since you're willing to pay up to $150.  Rejecting the offer will allow you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  $120 is a good deal for you, especially since you're willing to go up to $150. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price."
