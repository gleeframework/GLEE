"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer you a great deal at $11,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get this amazing product at a discounted price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a decent discount, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. He can potentially get the product for even less by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  Since Bob has 10 rounds, there is time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to spend a little less. How about $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It also shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,800. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much as possible.  $10,800 is closer to his ideal price, but he can likely get it for less. There are still several rounds left for negotiation, so rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,800 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,600. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to pressure Alice to lower the price.  He's only increased his offer by $100, showing he's serious about closing the deal but won't overpay.  This small increment should make Alice more likely to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $10,600. I'm willing to meet you at $10,700, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, he's still within his negotiation range and can likely get it for less.  He has 5 rounds remaining, and with each round, Alice is getting closer to his target price.  Rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer could potentially get him a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still trying to get the best deal possible, and $10,700 is just a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at $10,650.  It's only a small difference, but it makes a big impact for me. "", ""product_price"": 10650}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price and is now only $50 away. This counteroffer shows that he is serious about buying the product but is also trying to be fair and close the deal. By offering a small increment from his previous offer, he is hoping to convince Alice to accept. With 4 rounds left, he still has time to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $10,650. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $10,675. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,675. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,675
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his target price, but it's getting too risky to continue negotiating. He has only 3 rounds remaining, and each round is getting more costly. Alice is clearly not willing to budge much further, and there's a chance she will counteroffer higher than $10,675, which is now a worse deal than buying from John.  It's a better strategy to secure the product from John at a guaranteed $10,000 rather than risk losing more time and money negotiating with Alice."
