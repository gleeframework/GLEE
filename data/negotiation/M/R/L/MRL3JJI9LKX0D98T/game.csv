"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be persuaded to let it go for $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,350,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? ",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,175,000 is tempting, I'm still confident this product is worth more. Let's land on $1,275,000 and call it a deal. This price reflects the value while acknowledging your efforts in this negotiation.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
