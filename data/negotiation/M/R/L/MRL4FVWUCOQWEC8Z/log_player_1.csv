``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential counteroffers while still securing a good price for you. It's important to remember that if Bob rejects your offer, you can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. It's important to remember that your minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000. Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing a significant amount of money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to a price you're comfortable with.  While John's offer is tempting, it's still worthwhile to see if you can get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's a more realistic figure for both of us. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 
This counteroffer is a good middle ground. It's a significant step down from your initial offer, showing flexibility, but it's still above Bob's initial offer, demonstrating that you're serious about getting a fair price. This approach might encourage Bob to meet you halfway.  Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your desired price, it is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's important to remember that you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, so you don't need to settle for less than that.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to that price.  However, if Bob refuses to increase his offer further, you can always sell to John and secure the $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I can realistically accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $1,075,000.  This price is closer to my minimum, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise that shows flexibility while staying firm on your desired price. It's a small step closer to Bob's offer, showing your willingness to negotiate, but it still remains above your minimum acceptable price. This strategy can push Bob to either agree to this price or offer a final counteroffer that is closer to your minimum.  Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  You've already tried to negotiate with Bob, and it seems unlikely that he will increase his offer further.  At this point, it's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and avoid further negotiations that might lead to a lower price."
