"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $900,000. This is above Bob's maximum budget, so it's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate, and this offer should give her some room to move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to my target price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm not desperate to buy the product and have the option of buying from John for a better price.  Therefore, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm now offering Alice my maximum price, $800,000. This is the same price I could get from John, so it's a win-win situation.  Alice might still reject the offer, but I'm hoping she realizes that she's unlikely to get a better deal, especially with limited rounds left."
