Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation if he makes a counteroffer. It also keeps the offer attractive enough to avoid going straight to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is better than Bob's initial perceived value and closer to my minimum, I can likely get more. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially achieve a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer, but it shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm willing to continue negotiating to potentially reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one. It signals a willingness to reach an agreement while still pushing for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is essentially the same as his previous offer, indicating that he's unlikely to budge further. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk of continued negotiation leading to a lower price or an even longer process outweighs the potential gains. Selling to John at $15,000 guarantees a satisfying profit and avoids further uncertainty."
