"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, but I believe this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,100,000. I think this reflects the product's worth while still being a good deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
