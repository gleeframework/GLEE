"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll really benefit from it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product.  While I see the value it offers, $900,000 is still a bit high for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to come to an agreement.  Let's find a way to make this work.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $912,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a reasonable price for both of us.",912500.0,Alice,5,
