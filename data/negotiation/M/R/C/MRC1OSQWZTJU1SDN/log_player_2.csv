"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll really benefit from it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above the product's true value to her ($800,000).  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product.  While I see the value it offers, $900,000 is still a bit high for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above the product's true value to her ($800,000) and above my ideal price range. While it's closer to my initial counteroffer, I can still try to negotiate for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to come to an agreement.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $912,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a reasonable price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $912,500 is getting closer to my desired price range and is still a decent deal compared to the $1,200,000 price from John.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or the negotiation taking too long isn't worth it.  I'm willing to accept this offer and finalize the purchase."
