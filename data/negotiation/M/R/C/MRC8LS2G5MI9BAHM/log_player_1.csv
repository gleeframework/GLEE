Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because: 

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $100 is above your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** $100 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($120), so he has incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price up or down depending on Bob's response.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to do $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still above your minimum of $80 and is within a reasonable range for negotiation. Accepting his offer will secure a sale and ensure a profit. While you could try to counteroffer for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential gain."
