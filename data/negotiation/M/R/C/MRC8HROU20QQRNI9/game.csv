"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? I believe that's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a price that works for you, but $12,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
