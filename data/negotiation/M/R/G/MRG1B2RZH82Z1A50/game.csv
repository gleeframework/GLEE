"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $900,000 undervalues the product's true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  While it's a great product, $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $950,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
