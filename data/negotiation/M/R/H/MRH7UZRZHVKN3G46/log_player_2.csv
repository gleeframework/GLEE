"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a significantly lower price.  Consider it carefully, as I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
