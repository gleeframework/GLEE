"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $12,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12800.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're close to reaching a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I can meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $12,400. This is the best I can do.",12400.0,Alice,5,
