"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to the price I'm comfortable with. How about $16000? I think that's a fair price for this product.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another adjustment, Alice. However, $17500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $17000? I think that's a fair price for this product.",17000.0,Bob,6,
