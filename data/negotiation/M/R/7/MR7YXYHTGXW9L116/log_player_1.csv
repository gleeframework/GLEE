Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm confident it can really benefit you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

Reasoning:

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and appear flexible.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer is intentionally high to gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects it, we know he's price-sensitive. If he counters, we have a starting point for negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** We have the safety net of John's offer ($15,000), so we're not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, we started high for a reason. There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, we signal to Bob that we value the product higher and are willing to walk away. This might prompt him to increase his offer, even if it's just slightly above John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob.  However, the value of this product is quite significant. I could meet you halfway at $17,500. This is a fair offer considering the benefits it provides."", 
""product_price"": 17500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This approach suggests a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong position. 
* **Highlighting Value:** By reiterating the product's benefits, we reinforce its worth in Bob's mind, potentially justifying the higher price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  We are still above John's offer, giving us room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below John's Offer:** Bob's latest offer is now lower than what John is willing to pay.  
* **Limited Potential for Higher Offers:** Bob has consistently tried to bring the price down. It's unlikely he'll suddenly jump significantly higher.
* **Secure a Guaranteed Sale:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $15,000, which is a reasonable outcome and avoids further negotiation risks."
