"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a better deal than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible and 10 rounds give him leverage to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal. This should encourage Alice to consider a counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has only moved up $300 from her initial offer. This indicates she is willing to negotiate, but Bob can still push for a lower price. He's not going to get to $8,000 but might get closer with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, but still staying below his $8,000 limit. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is also trying to find a price that works for both of them.  By moving the price up, Bob might incentivize Alice to accept his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing some flexibility, lowering her offer slightly. While $9,700 is still above Bob's desired price, he has several rounds left and can likely negotiate a lower price.  Bob is willing to take a risk and continue negotiating, hoping for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to Alice's offer, but still keeping his offer below her most recent price.  This shows Alice he's willing to compromise but still aims for a price closer to his limit.  If Alice wants to close the deal, she'll likely need to lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer to $9,600, which is only $600 above Bob's maximum budget. With only three rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high. If Alice rejects Bob's next offer, she might make a counteroffer that's even higher, or she could refuse to negotiate further.  While it's not ideal, accepting this offer secures the product for Bob at a price he can afford."
