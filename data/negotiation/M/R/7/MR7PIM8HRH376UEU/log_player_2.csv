"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, we believe it's worth $14000. We're confident this price reflects the quality and utility of the product, while also ensuring you receive a fair deal. We look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the $12,000 he could get from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, my budget is limited, and I'm only able to offer $12,500 at this time.  This price reflects the value I place on the product and is the maximum I can afford.  I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. In light of that, I would like to propose an offer of $13000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the product's true value. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Since Bob has a guaranteed deal with John for $12,000, it's in his best interest to take that option and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
