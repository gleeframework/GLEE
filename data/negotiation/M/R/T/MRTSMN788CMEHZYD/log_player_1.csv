Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price significantly above your minimum ($15,000).
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The offer is high enough to potentially discourage Bob if he's not serious, saving you negotiation time.
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower the price, but never go below your $15,000 threshold."
