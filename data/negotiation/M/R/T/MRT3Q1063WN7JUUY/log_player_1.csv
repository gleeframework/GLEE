"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is still too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get a better offer in the next round. It's also important to note that selling to John for $15,000 is still a viable option. This gives me leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $9,800 is still not enough.  I'm willing to risk losing some money and continue negotiating to see if I can push for a better price.  I have three rounds left, and it's worth exploring if I can get closer to my goal of $15,000.  It's also worth noting that I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000, giving me some leverage in the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $9,800 is getting closer, I need to at least make $10,000 on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,150. This is a final offer from me."", ""product_price"": 10150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $10,000, and I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to pay $9,900 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, I'm running out of time. I only have two rounds left, and Bob's offer of $9,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I could continue to negotiate and risk getting nothing, I'm better off taking the guaranteed $15,000 from John.  This ensures I maximize my profit and avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
