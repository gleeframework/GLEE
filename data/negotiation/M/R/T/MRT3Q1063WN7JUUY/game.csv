,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. Let's find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $9,800 is getting closer, I need to at least make $10,000 on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,150. This is a final offer from me.",10150.0,Alice,7,
