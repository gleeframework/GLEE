Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground.  While $950,000 is still below what I value the product at, I'm willing to accept that price if we can agree on a shorter payment timeframe. Would you be open to making the full payment within [insert specific, shorter timeframe here, e.g., 30 days]?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We're getting closer to Bob's offer, showing we're willing to negotiate. 
* **Value Trade-Off:** Instead of lowering the price further, we're introducing a more appealing payment term (faster payment). This could be beneficial for us. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps us understand if Bob is truly limited by budget (and thus a faster payment might not be feasible) or if there's room for a deal with the right terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm open to discussing a shorter payment timeframe, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable committing to a 30-day payment period. I'm willing to make a payment within 60 days, but I'm still looking to get the price down to $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $900,000 with a 60-day payment plan?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob seems firmly set on $900,000. His willingness to negotiate on payment terms suggests his primary driver is price, not flexibility.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Further negotiation rounds with an uncertain outcome carry an opportunity cost. We have a guaranteed offer for $1,200,000 from John.
* **Stronger Position:** By walking away, we signal the value of the product and our willingness to accept nothing less. There's a small chance Bob might reconsider and improve his offer, but it's not worth the risk."
