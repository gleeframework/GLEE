{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm concerned that if I continue to reject his offers, he may walk away from the deal entirely.  $17,000 is still a decent profit and I don't want to risk getting stuck with the product and having to sell it to John for the lower price."
