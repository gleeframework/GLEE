"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This would be a good middle ground and allow us to both benefit from this transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is a fair price that balances our needs, and I believe we can finalize the deal.  Let's aim for a quick resolution.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
