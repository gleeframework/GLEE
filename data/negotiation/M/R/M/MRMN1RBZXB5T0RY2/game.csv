"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm offering it to you for $20000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $18000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15000, which is a fair compromise. I'm eager to get this product, but it needs to fit within my budget. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to go up to $15000, but I'm still not sure if that's enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $16500? It's a compromise that should work for both of us, don't you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While $16500 is tempting, I'm still a bit stretched. I'm prepared to offer $14000.  It's a fair price that reflects our compromise and allows both of us to get what we want.  Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $14000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $17000? It's a compromise that should work for both of us, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my previous offer.",17000.0,Alice,7,
