"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is my maximum budget for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects a significant discount from my original asking price and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,225,000. This is my best and final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's not ideal, accepting this offer is better than risking further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price.  Additionally, if I reject this offer, there is no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and I could end up with a lower final price. It's a good compromise considering the limited number of rounds remaining."
