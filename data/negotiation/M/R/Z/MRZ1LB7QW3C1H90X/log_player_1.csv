"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth much more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to me, while also being open to negotiation. This suggests flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer. 
* **First Round Strategy:**  I'm not yet concerned with immediately closing a deal in the first round.  My goal is to gauge Bob's interest and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Option:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I still have 9 rounds left. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  In the next round, I will counter with a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,400,000 is below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to accept $1,700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it offers. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm countering with a price that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Flexibility:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to be flexible, suggesting a possible compromise.
* **Fair Price:**  I'm justifying my counteroffer by mentioning the value the product offers.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** I'm ending with a statement that encourages further negotiation and finding a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **No Further Upside:**  There's no guarantee I can get a higher price from Bob in the remaining rounds.
* **John's Option:**  Selling to John would yield the same price as Bob's offer.
* **Time is of the Essence:**  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and it's better to secure the deal at my minimum price than risk further negotiation that might not result in a higher offer."
