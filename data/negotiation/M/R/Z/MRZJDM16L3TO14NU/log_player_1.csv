This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price, but leaves room for negotiation and potential for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While $110 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $115 by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while still leaving some room for potential profit."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price. While I prefer to sell it for more, accepting his offer is better than selling to John for $100."
