"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to my business.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1050000. This price still reflects the product's value and potential benefits, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to my business. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not willing to pay $1025000. I'm willing to meet you at $975000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to my business. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000 is too low, so I'm going to go for the next higher number. I'm offering the product to you for $1075000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Alice. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm making a final offer of $950000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1000000.",950000.0,Bob,10,
