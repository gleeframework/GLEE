"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000, which still gives you a great value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
