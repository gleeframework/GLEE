"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I'm currently looking to spend no more than $1,200,000.  I believe this price is still fair given the potential of the product. I'm open to discussing further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position on the budget, but I need to be fair to the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,250,000.  This price is fair and reflects the product's value while remaining within my budget.  I'm confident this price works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
