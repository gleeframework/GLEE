"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is too high, and Bob can likely get a better deal.  There are 9 more rounds to negotiate with Alice, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the most strategic move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I'm currently looking to spend no more than $1,200,000.  I believe this price is still fair given the potential of the product. I'm open to discussing further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob a chance to get a better price. There are still 7 rounds left, so Bob has time to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position on the budget, but I need to be fair to the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There are still 5 rounds left, so Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the most strategic move."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,250,000.  This price is fair and reflects the product's value while remaining within my budget.  I'm confident this price works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
