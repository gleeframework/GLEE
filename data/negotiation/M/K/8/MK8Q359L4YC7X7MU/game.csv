"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's the closest we can get to a fair price for both of us.,90.0,Bob,4,
