Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $19,000. This is a substantial reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $10,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's still a $2,500 profit over my absolute minimum ($10,000 - $7,500 = $2,500).
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the money in hand and can potentially reinvest it. Waiting for a better offer from Bob or going with John delays this.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to haggle could sour the deal, and there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. 

Accepting $10,000 secures a reasonable profit and avoids potential risks of continued negotiation."
