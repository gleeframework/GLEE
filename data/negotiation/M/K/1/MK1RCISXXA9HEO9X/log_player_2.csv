"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You want to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $120 is too high for you.  You are willing to pay up to $150, but you should try to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice $100 for the product. This is a significant discount from her initial offer of $120, and it's still within my budget. Hopefully, Alice will accept this offer, as it's still a profit for her. If not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to my target price, it's still higher than I want to pay.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating. I can potentially get a lower price if I keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice $110 for the product. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $100 and Alice's counteroffer of $130. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to meet halfway and encourages Alice to accept. It's still a good deal for me, and a profit for Alice.  If she rejects it, I'm still open to further negotiations, but I'm getting closer to my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to my limit.  $140 is still too high for me.  I'll reject the offer and continue to negotiate.  I'm hoping to get a better deal than this. If I can't reach a mutually agreeable price with Alice, I may consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice $120 for the product. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $110 and Alice's counteroffer of $140.  I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer as it's still a significant profit for her. 

If Alice rejects this offer, I'm very close to buying from John.  I'm hoping to avoid that, as it's a better deal for me to buy from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $145 is getting dangerously close to my limit. I've already rejected her previous offer of $140, and while $145 is slightly better, it's still not a great deal for me.  At this point, I'm better off buying from John. 

I've already spent a significant amount of time negotiating with Alice, and it's clear that she's not willing to budge much further. It's likely that any further negotiations with Alice will just waste more time and not result in a better price. 

Therefore, it's in my best interest to buy from John for $150, as it's a guaranteed transaction and doesn't involve any further negotiation."
