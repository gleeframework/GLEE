"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1100000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. This price reflects the value I believe the product brings to you, while also ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I understand your position, $1100000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000,  which is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product and my own financial constraints. I believe this price reflects a mutually beneficial agreement and I'm confident it will be a good investment for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price below $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value the product brings to you. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1050000 is still above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to offer $975000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my commitment to finding an agreement, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our desire to reach a mutually beneficial outcome.  What are your thoughts?",975000.0,Bob,6,
