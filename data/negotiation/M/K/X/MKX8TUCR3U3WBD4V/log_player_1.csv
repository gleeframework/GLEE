Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe my initial offer was already quite competitive.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer takes into account the significant value this product brings."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1,275,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and is moving closer to my initial offer. He's also indicated this is his ""lowest"" but that might be a negotiation tactic.  I'll push a little further while I still have room above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the immense value this product holds. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  How about we settle at $1,312,500? This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a fair deal."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, but I think I can do even better than that. How about we meet at $1,250,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is trying to regain control of the negotiation by jumping backwards in price after I countered his ""lowest offer"". It's a common tactic, but I still believe he's willing to go higher. I'll hold firm to see if he's serious about that being his best offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a significant investment, and I want to ensure we reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I feel your previous offer doesn't accurately reflect the value of this product. I'm open to meeting you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you consider $1,281,250?"",
""product_price"": 1281250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  By suggesting a price exactly between the last two offers, I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise without significantly lowering my asking price. This keeps the negotiation moving forward and maintains a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000, but I'd like to propose an additional concession. How about we meet at $1,262,500? I believe this is the best price we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,262,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,262,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I could potentially push for a bit more, Bob has steadily increased his offer and is now very close to my previous offer. Accepting now guarantees a good deal without risking the uncertainty of further negotiation.  It's always better to close a deal when both parties feel positive about the outcome."
