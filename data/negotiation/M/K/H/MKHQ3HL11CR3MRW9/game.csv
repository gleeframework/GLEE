"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $8,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,200. This is a fair price considering my budget and your need to sell the product. Let's make a deal.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,200. I can meet you halfway at $8,400, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",8400.0,Alice,5,
