Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $150 asking price represents a significant 50% markup, which is a common starting point in negotiations. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle that's still profitable for you. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't know Bob's financial situation or how much he might be willing to pay. If you had more information, you could tailor your offer more precisely."
