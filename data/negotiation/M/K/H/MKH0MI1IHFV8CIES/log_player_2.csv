"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is less than the $150 from John, you can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  You have room to negotiate as your maximum price is $150 and Alice's minimum is $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $115?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the offer, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $122? That's a very competitive price for this kind of value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $122 is a good price, you can still do better. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is closer to your bottom line.  By rejecting, you have more opportunity to negotiate and potentially get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit high at $122 though. Would you be willing to go to $118? That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 118}
