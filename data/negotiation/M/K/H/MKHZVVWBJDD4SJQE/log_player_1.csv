"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good price. I'm also aware that I have the safety net of selling to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to risk losing this deal if the price isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm aware that $15,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can potentially get a higher price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $18,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's more than what John is offering, and it's closer to my initial asking price. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since I only have 6 rounds left."
