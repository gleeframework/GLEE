,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  I think that's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $1,075,000? That's a significant step closer to my initial offer and puts us halfway between our last positions.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,090,000?  This is a compromise that shows I'm serious about making this deal work.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $1,090,000 is closer, but I'm still just a bit over my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $1,085,000. This is a final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement here, I'll have to consider my other options.",1085000.0,Bob,6,
