"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a price that's fair for both of us. I'm asking $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a better price can be reached before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  I think that's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a lower price before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $1,075,000? That's a significant step closer to my initial offer and puts us halfway between our last positions.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,090,000?  This is a compromise that shows I'm serious about making this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,090,000 is closer to Bob's target and shows Alice is serious about making a deal, it's still above his maximum. There's only one round left before he has to consider buying from John.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if they can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $1,090,000 is closer, but I'm still just a bit over my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $1,085,000. This is a final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement here, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 1085000}
