I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to make a deal, I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,250,000. This is still a fair profit for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer and might make him more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure we'll reach an agreement that's profitable for me. Rather than risk further negotiations, I'll accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,200,000."
