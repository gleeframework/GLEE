Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $95. While this is a decent price, I can do better. Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $85 for the product, which is $10 less than Alice's initial offer and $15 less than what it's worth to me. This is a reasonable counteroffer, as it still gives Alice a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $90 is a better price than John's offer of $100. While I would prefer to get it for $85, I'm happy to accept this offer as it's still within my budget and a good deal."
