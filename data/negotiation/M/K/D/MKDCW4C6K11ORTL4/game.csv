"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $130. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's see if we can find a solution.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'm offering the product to you for $125. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",125.0,Alice,5,
