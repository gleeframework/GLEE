"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to counteroffer at $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to counteroffer at $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $800000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $800000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $800000, which would be $775000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to counteroffer at $790000. This is my final offer, considering the product's value to me is $800000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",790000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $790000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $785000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",785000.0,Bob,8,

"Alice, I understand you're making one last concession, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $785000. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet at this price. I'm considering buying the product from John for $1500000, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",785000.0,Bob,10,
