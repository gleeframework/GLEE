Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $1,200,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While his offer is my minimum acceptable price, I can likely get closer to my original asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering its value."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I still need to stay within my budget. Could you consider reducing the price further? I'm hoping for something closer to $1,150,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not yet ready to accept it. There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get a higher price.  I will counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, but $1,150,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is my minimum. It's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
