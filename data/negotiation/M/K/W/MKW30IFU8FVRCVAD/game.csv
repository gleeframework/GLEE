"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a great deal, but it's also the best I can do. If you're truly serious, this is our last chance to make this work.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000, but I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you can accept this price, I'll make the deal. If not, I'll have to walk away and buy from John.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
