{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $1,200,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's less than his estimated value of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It gives you space to potentially negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's significantly less than your minimum:** This ensures you're not immediately losing out on your minimum desired value.

It's important to be prepared for a counteroffer from Bob, and be ready to negotiate based on his response. Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount of money, it's far below my minimum desired value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate, but not at a price that's too low for you. 
* **It's lower than your original offer:** This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to consider it seriously.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  This ensures you're not making a bad deal. 

By being firm but flexible, you increase the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum desired value.  I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can get Bob to come up a little more.  I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a great deal, but it's also the best I can do. If you're truly serious, this is our last chance to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

This counteroffer is a calculated risk:

* **It's a significant compromise:**  It's much closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **It's still above my minimum:**  I'm holding out for a bit more, but not jeopardizing my minimum.
* **It's a final offer:**  This creates urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision. 

This approach aims to pressure Bob into accepting the offer, as he might not be willing to walk away from the deal completely. It's a delicate balance, but if Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000, but I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you can accept this price, I'll make the deal. If not, I'll have to walk away and buy from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,000,000 is close to my minimum desired value, it's still a significant loss compared to what John is offering. I've already made several concessions, and further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a better outcome. It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and avoid the risk of potentially getting a worse deal with Bob."
