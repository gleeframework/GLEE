"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice's offer is above that. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. I'm offering $700,000, which is $200,000 less than her initial offer. This should hopefully get the negotiation going in the right direction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price.  I'll reject and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

Alice has come down in price, but it's still too high. I'm increasing my counteroffer to $750,000, which is halfway between her last offer and my previous offer. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also determined to get a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, her offer is still too high. I'll reject and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to offer Alice my absolute maximum, $800,000. This is the point where I'm willing to walk away and buy from John. Hopefully, Alice recognizes that this is my final offer and accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $812,500, which is still above my maximum price. With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'll buy the product from John at $800,000 to ensure I get the best deal possible."
