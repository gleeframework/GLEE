"Bob, I have a product I think would be incredibly valuable to you. It's something that I believe is worth at least $1,000,000, and I know it would be a great asset to your operations. I'm willing to offer it to you for a price of $1,050,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.  Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
