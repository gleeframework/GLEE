"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This still reflects the exceptional quality and potential of what I'm offering.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a bit below what I consider fair. How about we settle at $1,380,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",1380000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $1,380,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000. Can you consider this offer?",1320000.0,Bob,6,
