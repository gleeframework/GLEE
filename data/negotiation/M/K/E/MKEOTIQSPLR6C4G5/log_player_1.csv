"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  It holds immense value, and I believe it can greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both our perceived values. This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, implying a reason for the high price without revealing my true minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room to adjust in subsequent rounds based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both his own perceived value and my minimum. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  While I want to maximize profit, I'm prepared to negotiate. Rejecting this low offer signals that I'm serious and pushes Bob to make a more reasonable proposal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but your offer is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm lowering my price substantially to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate and move towards a deal.
* **Still Strong:** However, the new price is still significantly above both his offer and my minimum. This keeps the pressure on him to raise his bid. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""true value"" reinforces that my price isn't arbitrary and encourages a more serious counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I can offer you $600,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Bob's offer is increasing, the increments are small and still far below both his perceived value and my minimum.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting this offer would likely result in a significantly lower final price.
* **John Option:** I have the security of selling to John for my minimum.  This gives me leverage to continue pushing Bob.

I'll reject this offer but need to adjust my strategy. In the next round, I'll offer a smaller decrease to signal that my price is firming up but still leave room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price. However, $600,000 still undervalues this product and its potential for your business. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects fairness while acknowledging its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  I've reduced my price by $150,000, a smaller amount than before. This signals that I'm nearing my bottom line.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's worth, both intrinsically and to Bob's specific business. This aims to shift his focus from the price itself to the value he'd be gaining.
* **Time Pressure:** With only five rounds left, this offer adds a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to make a more significant move if he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be frank, I have a budget I need to stick to.  I can offer you $750,000.  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Budget Claim:** Bob mentioning a budget could be a negotiation tactic. Even if true, it doesn't obligate me to compromise significantly.
* **Insufficient Increase:** His offer increased by $150,000, matching my previous reduction. This suggests he's not mirroring my concessions, making a favorable deal less likely.
* **Alternative Option:**  I still have the security of selling to John at my minimum. 

The risk of accepting Bob's offer at this point outweighs the potential gain. I'll reject and prepare for a more aggressive counteroffer or consider selling to John soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have budget considerations, but I need to be realistic about this product's value. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this deal closed. However, I'm prepared to walk away and pursue other options if this doesn't work."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  Directly stating this is my ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and limits further back-and-forth.
* **Firm but Fair:** The price is a substantial reduction, demonstrating willingness to compromise, but still significantly above both Bob's offers and my minimum.
* **Alternative Emphasized:** Explicitly mentioning other options (John) reinforces that I have alternatives and am not desperate to close with Bob at any cost. 

This strategy aims to push Bob towards a final decision while maintaining a strong position. If he rejects this offer, selling to John becomes the more attractive option."
