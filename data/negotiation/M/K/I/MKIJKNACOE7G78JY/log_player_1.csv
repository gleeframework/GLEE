Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room for negotiation and hopefully allows me to get a price closer to my minimum.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to adjust my price, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take it, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value. Hopefully, Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise and accepts."

Bob's offer is still lower than I'd like, but I'm getting closer to my minimum.  I'll reject this offer and make one last counteroffer. If he rejects this one, I'll sell to John."

This is my final offer. It's a bit of a compromise, but I'm still making a profit and it's closer to my minimum than Bob's last offer.  If he rejects, I'll be happy to sell to John."

Bob's offer is still lower than I want.  I've reached my limit with negotiation, and I don't want to risk another rejection. I'll sell to John and guarantee myself the $150."
