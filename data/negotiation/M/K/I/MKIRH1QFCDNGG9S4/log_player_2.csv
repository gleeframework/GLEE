"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe you'll find extremely valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price, considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $10,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might:

* **Prompt a counter-offer:** Alice might be willing to lower the price to secure the sale. 
* **Get a better deal from John:**  While John's initial offer is $15,000, there might be room for negotiation there as well. 

You have more to gain by exploring other options before accepting Alice's first offer."
