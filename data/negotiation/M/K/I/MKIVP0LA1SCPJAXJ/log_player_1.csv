{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. By expressing openness to negotiation, I hope to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially arrive at a price we're both happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $85? Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll counteroffer to try and reach a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you offering $85, but I'm unable to go that low.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, how about $110?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down, but $110 is still a little too high for my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, so how about we split the difference and go with $95?  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's previous offer, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. Rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob, I'll take the guaranteed $120 offer from John."
