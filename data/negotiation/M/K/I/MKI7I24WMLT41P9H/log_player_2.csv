"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which is valued at $10,000 by you. I am offering this exceptional item to you for $9,500. This is an exclusive opportunity to own a product that offers unparalleled benefits and value. Don't miss out on this chance to secure it at a competitive price. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is below your maximum budget of $10,000, it's still higher than John's offer of $10,000. You can save $500 by going with John. 

**Important Note:** Alice's message is a bit manipulative. She claims the product is valued at $10,000 *by you*, trying to inflate the perceived value.  Always focus on your own valuation and available alternatives."
