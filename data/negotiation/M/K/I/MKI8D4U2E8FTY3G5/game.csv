"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is not quite as high as you've stated. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth and the potential benefits it will bring to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  I'm open to finding a compromise, so I'm proposing $1,100,000. This price better reflects the true value and the returns you can expect.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still believe $1,100,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we find a compromise at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I value reaching an agreement. Let's settle this at $1,050,000.  This acknowledges your budget considerations while reflecting the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can we meet at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
