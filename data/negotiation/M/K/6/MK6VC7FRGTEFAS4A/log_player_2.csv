Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You should reject Alice's offer. You are willing to pay up to $120 and Alice is asking for $100, so there is room to negotiate.  You can try to get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about $95? That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are trying to buy the product as cheaply as possible, and $95 is still more than you want to pay.  You can likely get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $95 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $92. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
