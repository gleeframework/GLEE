"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from what the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum. This should encourage him to negotiate further, leading to a better outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than $80, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $100. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about $95? That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $95 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $92. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my desired price of $95. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a good profit, as it's well above my minimum of $80 and within a reasonable range. It's also wise to consider the time constraint and the potential of further negotiation rounds potentially leading to a stalemate or even a lower price."
