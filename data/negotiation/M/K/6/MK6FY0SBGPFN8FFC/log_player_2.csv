{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is offering $1,400,000. There is room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for counter-offers.**  By rejecting, you can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting low:** I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows my intent to negotiate and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Room for compromise:** $1,200,000 is still above Alice's minimum value, leaving room for her to counter without losing too much. 
* **Strategic first move:** This counteroffer sets the stage for the negotiation.  Alice's response will reveal her willingness to compromise and help me gauge how much more I can push for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price, but closer.**  You're aiming for a price below $1,300,000.
* **Further negotiation is possible.** By rejecting, you continue the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price. You still have 7 rounds left, so there's time for more negotiation. 
* **Buying from John is still too expensive.** While John offers a guaranteed price, it's higher than Alice's current offer and higher than your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Incremental increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying within my budget:** $1,250,000 is still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer aims to see how much Alice is willing to budge. If she rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer again in the next round."
