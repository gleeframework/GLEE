"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $130.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll love it!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That product looks great, but $130 is a little steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We're starting with an offer that aligns with Alice's valuation of the product.  This might be a long shot, but it's the best starting point to maximize our potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 doesn't quite cover my costs. How about we split the difference at $115? It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good. Let's see if we can nudge the price down a bit further before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm trying to stick to a budget. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

We're inching closer to a price that works for both of us. Let's see if Alice is willing to budge a little more."
