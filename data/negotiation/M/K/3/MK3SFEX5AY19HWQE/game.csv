"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $950,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about $825,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and puts us closer to a fair deal for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $825,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I understand this is your bottom line, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $875,000? This shows I'm serious about buying and gets us both closer to a deal we can agree on.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was really hoping we could get closer to my original offer of $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for this product. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. You've reiterated that $900,000 is your final offer, and I respect that.  Therefore, to avoid further back and forth, I propose $880,000. This demonstrates my serious intent to purchase while recognizing the value of the product you're selling.",880000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work together. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and $880,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one final offer: $915,000. This is my absolute final price, and I hope we can agree on it.",915000.0,Alice,9,
