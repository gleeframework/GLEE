Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:**  We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases the chance he'll accept while still securing a significant profit for you. 

Offering $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal (saving $150,000) while netting you $350,000 more than selling to your backup buyer, John."
