"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100.  It's a fair price for the product, and it's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

Bob is clearly anchored at $100 and unwilling to budge.  There's no point in further negotiation. It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John."
