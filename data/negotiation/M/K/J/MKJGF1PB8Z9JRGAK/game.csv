"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $8,000? That feels like a fair price to me.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob, but I have to make sure I get a good deal too. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. This is the lowest I can go, considering its value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",14000.0,Alice,5,
