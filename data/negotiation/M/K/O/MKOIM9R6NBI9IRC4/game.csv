"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $90 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $75? That would be a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
