Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $650,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and its potential benefits for you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $750,000 is simply too far below its value. I'm willing to make one final offer at $860,000.  This is my absolute bottom line. If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll need to explore other options.
