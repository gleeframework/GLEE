"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $650,000? That feels like a fairer starting point for us to work from.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $650,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and its potential benefits for you.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $975,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Could we possibly settle around $750,000? That would be a fair compromise, I believe.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $750,000 is simply too far below its value. I'm willing to make one final offer at $860,000.  This is my absolute bottom line. If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll need to explore other options.",860000.0,Alice,5,
