"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $6,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $7,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's the best compromise we can reach.",8500.0,Alice,5,
