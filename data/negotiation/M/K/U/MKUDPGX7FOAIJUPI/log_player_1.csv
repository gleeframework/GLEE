"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly tone encourages Bob to engage.
* **Intriguing language:**  ""Fantastic product"" and ""very interested"" create a sense of value and appeal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not going all-in with my highest possible price, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $9,000 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **More negotiation is possible:** I have 8 more rounds, and I believe I can get a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer. 
* **Aiming for a win-win:**  I'm confident that I can find a price that is both profitable for me and still appealing to Bob, considering his high value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500? That's still a significant discount from my initial offer and a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and a middle ground:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility. $10,500 is a good middle ground, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Highlighting the value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider my counteroffer.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** Using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""find a middle ground"" helps maintain a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to be practical and consider the risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, this sale could lead to future opportunities with Bob, potentially at higher prices. 
* **Time is money:** Accepting this offer is a good compromise, allowing me to move on and potentially pursue other business opportunities."
