"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still too high, and he can potentially get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500? That's still a significant discount from my initial offer and a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is a better price than the initial offer, Bob should still try to negotiate further. He has room to go lower, and he's still within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 9500}
