"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $16,000 for it. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept.  This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet halfway between our offers at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is valuable, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,500 is close, but I need to get a bit more for it to make sense for me. Would you consider $11,500?  This would be my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
