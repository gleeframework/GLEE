"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1450000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product, which is still a good price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $1250000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This is still a great price considering the value to you, and it gives us both room to make a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1350000. However, I'm still not quite there. Considering the value to me, I can offer $1300000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1300000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer you the product for $1325000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let's finalize this.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1325000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more room.  I can offer $1310000, which is a fair price and gets us very close to a deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to come up.  $1310000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll offer the product to you for $1315000.  This is a small increase from your last offer, and it gets us very close to a deal.  Let's finalize this.",1315000.0,Alice,7,
