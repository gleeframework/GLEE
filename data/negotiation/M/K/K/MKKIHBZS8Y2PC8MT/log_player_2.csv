"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $15,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's a chance Alice might accept a lower price to avoid losing the sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going below $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. How about $11250? This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but her counteroffer is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  At this point, Bob is likely to get a better deal by going with John, who is offering the product for his maximum price.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks going back and forth without reaching a mutually agreeable price, and Bob might end up losing the opportunity to buy from John."
