"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1400000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $1200000? That's my absolute maximum, and it would be a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, $1200000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I need to know that this is a serious offer. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I need to know you're committed to it.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
