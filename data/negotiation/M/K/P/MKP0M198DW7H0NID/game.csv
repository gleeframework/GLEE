"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $150 to you.",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $130 is a bit high for me.  How about $125?  That's still a good deal for you and within my budget.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let's meet in the middle.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $130.  I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to budge from my previous offer of $135. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to $136. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell the product to you.",136.0,Alice,5,
