"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be open to discussing that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $17,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000?  I'm really interested in this product and think we can find a way to make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
