"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $150. Since I know the product is worth at least $120 to me, I want to maximize my profit.  Bob might reject this offer, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I still have 9 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, hopefully making him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to $120 by continuing to negotiate. I'm only down to 6 rounds, so I have time to see if I can squeeze out a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still gives me a good profit margin. With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to start making concessions, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This time, I'm going to sell the product to John. While $115 is pretty close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm down to only 4 rounds left.  Given the time pressure and the fact that John is willing to pay my minimum, it's best to cut my losses and move on."
