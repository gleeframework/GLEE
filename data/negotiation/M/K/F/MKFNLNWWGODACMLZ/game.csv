"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $155. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",155.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about $130?  That's a fair compromise between our positions.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $145. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
