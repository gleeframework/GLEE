# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
