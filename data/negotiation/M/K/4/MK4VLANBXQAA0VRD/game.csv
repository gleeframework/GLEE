"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and a great value for you. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it would be a fair deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $700,000 is still quite a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $850,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.  Let's make this happen!",850000.0,Alice,5,
