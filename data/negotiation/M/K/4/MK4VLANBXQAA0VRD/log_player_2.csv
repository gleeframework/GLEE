Alice's offer:

I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $700,000 is still quite a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $850,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.  Let's make this happen!

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $800,000, it makes more sense to take that deal and save the extra $50,000."
