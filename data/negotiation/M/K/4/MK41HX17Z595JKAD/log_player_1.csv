Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $800,000 (Your fallback offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Zone:** $400,000 (The difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that captures a significant portion of that potential profit zone without being so high that Bob is discouraged.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob. 
* **Price:** $1,050,000 is a strong opening offer. It allows for some negotiation room while still securing you a substantial profit above your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. 
* **Relationship:** If building a long-term relationship is important, a slightly less aggressive offer might be favored.
* **Market Factors:**  Are there other potential buyers besides John?  A stronger market might give you more leverage.
