"I understand that you think $750000 is a fair price, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe the product's value to you is even higher than that, considering your initial estimate of $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so $850000 is my next offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
