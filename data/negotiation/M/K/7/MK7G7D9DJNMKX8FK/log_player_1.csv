Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $12,000.  I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly mention why the price is so high, it hints at the product's ""significant value"" to pique Bob's interest and potentially justify the price in his mind.
* **Alternative:** Having John as a backup buyer gives Alice leverage. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out completely.

**Important Considerations:**

This strategy is aggressive. Bob might:

* **Accept immediately:**  Great outcome for Alice!
* **Counter-offer:** Opens the door for negotiation.
* **Reject outright:** Alice can still sell to John for her minimum price. 

It's a calculated risk based on maximizing potential profit."
