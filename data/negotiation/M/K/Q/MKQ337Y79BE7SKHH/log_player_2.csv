"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While $110 is less than Alice's value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John. You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your alternative."
