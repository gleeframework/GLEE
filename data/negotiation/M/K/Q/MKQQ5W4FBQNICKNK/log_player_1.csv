Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **50% Markup:** The offer of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from your minimum acceptable price. While this is ambitious, it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price without revealing your hand about having another buyer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you have no prior information about Bob's negotiation style. If you know he's extremely price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be wiser. 
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have a backup buyer,  a long-term business relationship with Bob might be valuable. Consider if a slightly smaller profit margin is acceptable to secure that."
