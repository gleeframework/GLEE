"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more to you. Let me know your thoughts!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1750000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in your product but my budget is closer to $1000000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, how about we meet in the middle at $1375000? This price still reflects the value this product offers, while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1375000 is still outside my range. I'm comfortable offering $1200000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase your product while still staying within my budget. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is closer, it's still a bit low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This price reflects the value of the product while also offering you a substantial discount. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I see we're getting closer.  While $1400000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go to $1250000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1250000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  However, I want to make this work. How about we meet in the middle again at $1325000? This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1325000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to go to $1275000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe this price fairly reflects the value we're both placing on the product. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  $1275000 is closer to my desired price, but I still need to make a bit more to justify selling. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's close this deal!",1300000.0,Alice,9,
