"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get a better price.  While buying from John is always an option, there's a chance you can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in your product but my budget is closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, how about we meet in the middle at $1375000? This price still reflects the value this product offers, while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  It's worth rejecting and sending a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further.  There's still a chance to get a better deal, and the option to buy from John remains."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,375,000 is still outside my range. I'm comfortable offering $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase your product while still staying within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is closer, it's still a bit low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This price reflects the value of the product while also offering you a substantial discount. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, but it's closer to his target. There's still potential to negotiate a better price by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer. While buying from John is an option, it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I see we're getting closer.  While $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go to $1,250,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1250000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  However, I want to make this work. How about we meet in the middle again at $1325000? This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer to see if Alice will come down further.  There are still rounds left, and it's possible to get a better deal. The option to buy from John is always present, but there's potential for a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to go to $1,275,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe this price fairly reflects the value we're both placing on the product. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  $1275000 is closer to my desired price, but I still need to make a bit more to justify selling. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at the 9th round, and Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's target price of $1,000,000. While there's a chance of getting a better deal by making another counteroffer, it's risky. There's only one round left, and Alice might not budge further.  

Given that John is offering the product for $1,000,000, it's the most sensible option.  This ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price and avoids the potential of losing out in the final round with Alice."
