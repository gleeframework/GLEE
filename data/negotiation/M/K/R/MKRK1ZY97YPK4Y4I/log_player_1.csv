Round 4

I'm going to try to squeeze out a bit more from Bob.  He's already shown he's willing to go higher than $8,500, so I'll see if I can get him to budge further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700.

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $8,700.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a better deal than selling to John for $8,000.  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by continuing to counteroffer."
