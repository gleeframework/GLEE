"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you consider $10,000?  I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is still a good deal for Bob. He's willing to pay up to $15,000, so getting the product for $11,500 saves him $3,500.  While he could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go much lower, and the risk of her rejecting another offer and ending the negotiation is too high. Accepting the offer guarantees a good price and avoids the risk of getting stuck with John's higher price."
