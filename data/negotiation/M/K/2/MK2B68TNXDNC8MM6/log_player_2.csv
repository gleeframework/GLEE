"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. Given the product's value to me, I'm offering $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product, and it's closer to a figure that works for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, especially since you still have rounds to go. You could also consider buying from John at this point, as his price is closer to your target, but it's still possible to secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
