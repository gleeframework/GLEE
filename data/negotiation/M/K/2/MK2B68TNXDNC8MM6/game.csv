"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. Given the product's value to me, I'm offering $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product, and it's closer to a figure that works for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
