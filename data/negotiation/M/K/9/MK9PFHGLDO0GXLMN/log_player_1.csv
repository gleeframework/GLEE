Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110, which is a bit lower than my minimum but leaves some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is too low for me, and I'm willing to risk losing the sale to John rather than accepting such a low offer. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $100,  hoping to find a middle ground with Bob.  I'm still above my minimum and believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $95 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum, and I risk losing the sale to John if I keep negotiating.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
