"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,500. I'm confident that you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  He has 10 rounds to work with, and he knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, giving him room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than $11,500, Bob can still potentially negotiate further.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so there is room for him to get a price closer to his target. He has 7 rounds left, so there is time to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? This would be a mutually beneficial deal and ensure a swift transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,250. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll see its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. While $11,250 is closer to his target, he still has 5 rounds left and knows that Alice is willing to negotiate further. He can try to get the price down even lower by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,000? This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not willing to back down on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,250 is too high, so I'll go to $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is the same price as Alice's initial offer, Bob knows that Alice is willing to negotiate further and that her minimum price is likely closer to $11,000.  He has three rounds left and can try to get the price down further.  He can also consider that if he rejects this offer, he can buy from John for $12,000, so he has some leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm ready to close the deal today at $11,250.  This price is fair and reflects the value of the product.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,750. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has one round left and Alice's offer of $11,750 is too high. While it is tempting to continue negotiating, Bob is getting close to his maximum budget.  He can get the product for a guaranteed $12,000 from John.  This is a better outcome than continuing with Alice and risking not getting a deal at all or having to accept a price closer to $12,000.  By buying from John, Bob ensures he gets the product while staying within his budget."
