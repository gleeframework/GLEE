Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable offer of $1,500,000.  I'm confident that I can secure a good deal, and I'm willing to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me at a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's below my minimum acceptable offer.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, considering he offered $1,400,000. I'm hoping to meet in the middle, but I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still a bit below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable offer. Accepting this deal ensures I sell the product and get a price that's significantly higher than what I would receive from John. I'm also factoring in the risk of further negotiation, as Bob might reject my next offer and I might end up selling to John after all."
