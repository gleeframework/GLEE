"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm hoping to secure a better deal. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to pay $750,000. This represents a significant savings for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $750,000 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $850,000. This is a significant discount from the initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's split the difference and I'll offer you $800,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the $800,000 price point. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
