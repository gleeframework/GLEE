Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we could offer it at $120 (our guaranteed sale price), aiming slightly lower increases the chance of Bob accepting and getting a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $110 is a price that still nets us a good profit above our minimum. It's also significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, making it seem like a good deal if he's convinced by the ""special price"" framing.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We have the safety net of John, ensuring we won't be pressured into lowballing the price."
