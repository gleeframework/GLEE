"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $10,500, which is still a fair price considering my budget. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your perspective. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me considering the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $11,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within budget while giving you a fair price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
