Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Offering it at $170 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  The initial offer helps gauge how interested Bob is and whether further negotiation is worthwhile. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could also test different pricing strategies to see how Bob responds."
