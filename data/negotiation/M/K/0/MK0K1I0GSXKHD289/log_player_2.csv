"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this [product name] and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While $120 is less than Alice's value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your alternative."
