"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price ($12,000 > $15,000).**  You want to save as much money as possible.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.** 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option, but it's not the most favorable choice.** You're aiming to get a better deal than $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be open to that?  I think we can work out a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $11000? It's a fair compromise that I think we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your acceptable price range ($11,000 <= $15,000).**
* **You've already made one counteroffer, and it's likely that further negotiation would be time-consuming.** 
* **You're saving $4,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant amount.**

While you could try to negotiate further, accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a price that's good for you and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or you needing to go to John."
