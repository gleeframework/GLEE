"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. I could consider coming down to $1,100,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  $1,100,000 is lower than John's $1,200,000, so buying from Alice saves Bob money.
* **Further negotiation is risky.** While Bob could try to get a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will agree.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, and Bob might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice as it provides a good price and minimizes the risk of losing out on the product altogether."
