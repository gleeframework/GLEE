"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I need to be flexible, $800,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm going to try to bring him up to a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a fair offer considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer and see if I can convince him to meet me halfway.  If he doesn't, I'll be happy to sell to John for $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still confident in the value of this product, but I'm willing to make a final concession. Let's split the difference.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. How about we meet right in the middle at $937,500? This seems like a fair deal for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $937,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I'm still within my range for selling to John. I have a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. This product is truly exceptional, and I believe it's worth more than $937,500.  How about we compromise at $956,250? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your needs. It's a small step closer to your last offer, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 956250}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting down to the wire here. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $946,875. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm hoping you'll see its value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $946,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $946,875

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I've only got two rounds left, and I'm not sure I can get a much higher price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a solid profit, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price or running out of time."
