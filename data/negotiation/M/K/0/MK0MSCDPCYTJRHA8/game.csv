"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a price that I believe reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a fair offer considering its value to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still confident in the value of this product, but I'm willing to make a final concession. Let's split the difference. I'm offering you the product for $975,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while allowing me to receive a fair return. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. How about we meet right in the middle at $937,500? This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",937500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. This product is truly exceptional, and I believe it's worth more than $937,500.  How about we compromise at $956,250? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your needs. It's a small step closer to your last offer, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.",956250.0,Alice,7,
