Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob has a strong incentive to accept as he'll save $20.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still increase the price a bit without losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

The reason for accepting Bob's offer is:

* **Profit:**  Selling for $95 is still significantly better than your minimum of $80 and leaves some room for profit.
* **Negotiation cost:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely if Bob gets frustrated or changes his mind. 
* **Opportunity cost:** By selling now, you can avoid the time and effort of further negotiation."
