"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I understand its value, my budget is more limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for coming back with a proposal.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value this product brings is substantial. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,400,000 is still a significant gap from what I have in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
