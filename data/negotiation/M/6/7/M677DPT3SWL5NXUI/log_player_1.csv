Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price of $130, which is slightly above the value Bob places on the product. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. It's also higher than my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the value I place on the product. It's worth exploring further negotiation to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125. This is a compromise,  halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still lower than what I'm comfortable with.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob. I'll take the guaranteed $120 from John and move on."
