"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? This price still reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,750? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,750 is still a bit too far off from what I need.  Would you consider $10,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to try to get as close to my target of $8,000 as possible. How about $9,200? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I understand your budget constraints, but $9,200 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about $9,600? This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get what we want out of this deal.  Let's close this! ",9600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $9,600 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer. How about $9,400? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to be confident that I'm getting the best deal possible.",9400.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, this is my final offer. I'm willing to come down to $9,500 for this product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to finalize this deal. I understand you have a budget, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return for my product. Let's make this happen!",9500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and effort, but I'm afraid I need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I don't get a better price. I'm willing to pay $8,500, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",8500.0,Bob,10,
