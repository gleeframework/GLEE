Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get closer to my target price. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? This price still reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,750? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is a better offer than Bob's previous one, it's still not close to what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,750 is still a bit too far off from what I need.  Would you consider $10,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to try to get as close to my target of $8,000 as possible. How about $9,200? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,200 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not meeting my minimum needs. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I have a few more rounds to work with, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $10,000 at this point.  I believe that with some further negotiation, we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I understand your budget constraints, but $9,200 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about $9,600? This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get what we want out of this deal.  Let's close this! "", ""product_price"": 9600}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $9,600 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer. How about $9,400? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to be confident that I'm getting the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm running out of rounds, I'm still not ready to accept $9,400. It's close to my desired price, but I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and try one more time to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident that I can reach a mutually beneficial agreement in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. I'm willing to come down to $9,500 for this product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to finalize this deal. I understand you have a budget, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return for my product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, but I'm afraid I need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I don't get a better price. I'm willing to pay $8,500, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge much further, and I've exhausted all my negotiation options. I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000, and with only one round left, John offers a much better deal."
