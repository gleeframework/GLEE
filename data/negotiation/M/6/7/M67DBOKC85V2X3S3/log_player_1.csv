Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone, emphasizing the value of the product and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  Starting high gives me more leverage in the negotiation.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** A positive message makes him more likely to continue the conversation. 
* **Be prepared to counteroffer:** I'm ready to negotiate if Bob rejects my initial offer. 

Remember, I can always walk away and sell to John for $100 if I'm not satisfied with Bob's counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($100).**  I cannot afford to sell for less than $100, as it's below my own valuation of the product.
* **Selling to John is still a viable option.** John is willing to pay my minimum price, so rejecting Bob's offer doesn't leave me in a worse position.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain my negotiation position:**  It shows I'm not desperate and willing to settle for less.
* **Potentially get a better offer from Bob:**  He may be willing to go higher if he's truly interested in the product. 

I'll now proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This still represents a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is close to Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get as close to my minimum price as possible. 
* **Positive and encouraging message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints and emphasize the value proposition of the product to keep the negotiation going.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  I'm leaving some room to potentially negotiate further if Bob is unwilling to meet my counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain my negotiation power:** By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I show that I'm in control of the negotiation.
* **Get closer to my desired price:**  A counteroffer is a step in the right direction.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** By remaining friendly and open to negotiation, I increase the chances of a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($100).** I'm not willing to sell for less than what I believe the product is worth.
* **John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price.**  Since John is willing to pay my desired price, there's no reason to risk continuing the negotiation with Bob.

While I would like to get a higher price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or no sale at all.  Selling to John guarantees a successful transaction at my minimum acceptable price."
