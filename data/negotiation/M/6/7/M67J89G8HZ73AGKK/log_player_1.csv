I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is the price I'd get from John, so it's my minimum acceptable offer. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay that much, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if he isn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $900,000, as that's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than his offer.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop my price that much.  It's better to sell to John for $1,200,000 and ensure I get a good deal."
