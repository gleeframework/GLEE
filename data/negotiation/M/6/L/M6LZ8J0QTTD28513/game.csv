"Alice, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's try to work this out.",12000.0,Alice,3,
