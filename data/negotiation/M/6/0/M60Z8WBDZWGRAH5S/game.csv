"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product,  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my final offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $102. This is my best offer. Let me know if it's something you'd be interested in.",102.0,Alice,5,
