"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with an offer significantly higher than both Bob's valuation ($800,000) and our minimum ($1,000,000).  This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a high level.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains amicable, emphasizing this is an initial proposal, and we are open to further discussion. 

This strategy sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation while leaving us the option to walk away and accept John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. We have ample room for negotiation and rounds left.  We'll aim to gently steer him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the true market potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,150,000. This reflects its unique value while offering you a competitive advantage."",
""product_price"": 1150000
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and make a significant concession from our initial price, but not too much. We still anchor the value by stating it ""undervalues the true market potential.""
* **Stronger Value Statement:** We reiterate the ""unique value"" and now add ""competitive advantage"" to further bolster Bob's perceived value.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer still allows for further negotiation while moving closer to a potentially agreeable price point above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still committed to finding a fair price for this product. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle -  I'm offering $950,000. This allows for a healthy profit for you while remaining within my price range.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now nearing our minimum acceptable price, but we're not quite there yet. He's also showing strong signs of wanting to close the deal. By rejecting this offer and proposing a counteroffer slightly above our minimum, we might be able to secure a more favorable outcome than John's offer.  The risk of Bob walking away is calculated, but the potential reward for one more round of negotiation is worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution. I'm willing to make a final adjustment to close this deal quickly. Let's settle on $1,025,000. This recognizes the product's value while offering you a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1025000
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sense of Urgency and Finality:** By introducing this as a ""final adjustment"" and aiming to ""close the deal quickly,"" we signal to Bob that our offer is serious and time-sensitive. 
* **Slight Margin Above Minimum:** We're strategically positioning our offer slightly above our minimum ($1,000,000) to allow for a small buffer while still aiming for a more profitable outcome than John's offer.
* **Balance of Value and Deal:** We reiterate the product's value while emphasizing the ""fair deal"" aspect, appealing to both our need for a good price and Bob's desire for a reasonable purchase.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between securing a favorable price and mitigating the risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  we're getting closer! While I appreciate your latest offer,  $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's close this deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly unwilling to meet our minimum price of $1,000,000.  While he keeps inching closer, the incremental increases are unlikely to reach our target within the remaining rounds. 

* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him walking away and us losing out on John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer.
* **Time Value:** Each round spent negotiating with Bob is an opportunity cost, as time spent here could be used to potentially find other buyers willing to meet our valuation.

It's more profitable to take John's guaranteed offer at this stage than to continue a negotiation with diminishing returns."
