Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,250 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $12,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $12,750.  It's not worth risking missing out on the guaranteed $12,000 price from John."
