Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product.  I'm asking $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $100 gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes flexibility, making Bob feel like he can get a good deal.
* **Value Proposition:**  While the message doesn't go into specifics, it suggests the product is ""fantastic,"" hinting at its potential value.

This strategy aims to get a good starting point while keeping the negotiation open."
