"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,000. This is a great deal, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of it.",7000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $5,500?",5500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",6500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $6,500 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to come down a little more?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the price down, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $6,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",6250.0,Alice,5,
