"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $15,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is a bold move, but Bob is willing to risk it in hopes of securing a better deal.  It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the chance to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price from Alice.  He's still considering buying from John, but wants to exhaust all options with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but still wants to save as much as possible.  He's offering $12,500, which is a compromise between his initial offer and Alice's latest one.  This counteroffer shows that he's serious about buying the product but is still looking for a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer of $13,000 is still too high for Bob.  While he could continue negotiating, the risk of getting a worse deal is increasing, especially since John is offering the product for $12,000.  To ensure he gets the best deal possible, Bob decides to buy the product from John."
