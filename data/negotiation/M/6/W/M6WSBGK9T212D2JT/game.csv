"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's split the difference - how about $8,750? That's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me get this great product without breaking the bank.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can come to an agreement.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to get the product within my budget while giving you a good price.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go back to $9,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $9,150. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",9150.0,Alice,7,
