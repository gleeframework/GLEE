"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to establish a high starting point to see if Bob is truly interested and to potentially leave room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves some room for negotiation while also demonstrating that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  It's worth pushing for a few more rounds to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $900,000. This is a middle ground between our previous offers and hopefully will be more appealing to Bob. We're getting closer to a deal, and I want to make sure we don't miss this opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We've reached a point where the price is getting very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing a deal and ending up with only $800,000 from John.  It's time to take the sure thing."
