"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",82.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $82.50 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $80? That's my absolute limit, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $84. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $83.50. It's a great price for a product that I'm confident you'll love.",83.5,Alice,5,
