"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to you, I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. This is my best offer for now.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is my final offer. This is a fair price, given the product's value to me.  Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking to finalize the deal, but I'm not willing to sell at $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,5,
