"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the value of the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand you're working within a budget. While I'm happy to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to accept. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe you'll still be getting a fantastic product at a competitive price.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

This price still allows me to cover my costs and ensures you get a valuable product at a competitive price. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
