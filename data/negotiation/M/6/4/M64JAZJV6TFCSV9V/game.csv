"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer on this product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I think this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
