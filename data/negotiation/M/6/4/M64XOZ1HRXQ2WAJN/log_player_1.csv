Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but not too far from John's offer. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also makes it clear that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and John's offer.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140 as a compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price and reflects the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, it's likely that we won't reach a price that satisfies both of us.  Selling to John for $150 ensures that I get a fair price for the product."
