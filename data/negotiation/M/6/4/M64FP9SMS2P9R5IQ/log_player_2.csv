"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice. Since you have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position. However, the value of this product to you is significant, and I need to ensure a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my desired price, but $13,000 is still a bit high. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not desperate to buy from Alice. I'll keep trying to drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $13,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's work this out."", ""product_price"": 12500}
