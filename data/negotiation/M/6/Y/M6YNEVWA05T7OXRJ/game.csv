"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. This is a competitive offer, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price? I'm thinking closer to $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $820,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $820,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I feel that would be a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm counteroffering at $790,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your budget constraints.",790000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $770,000?",770000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $770,000. I'm counteroffering at $785,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",785000.0,Alice,7,
