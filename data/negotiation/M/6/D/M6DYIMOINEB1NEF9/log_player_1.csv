Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate, but also lower than your minimum price, leaving you room to potentially compromise. This strategy allows for a back-and-forth negotiation while keeping the option to sell to John for your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'm not willing to go above $900000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum price, it's still below your ideal profit margin. It's worth exploring further negotiation rounds to see if you can reach a more favorable agreement. You can try to counter with a price closer to your original offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I can't go all the way down to $900,000, but I'm open to meeting in the middle. How about $950,000? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $920000? That's the best I can do. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $920,000 is still below your ideal price, it's only a small difference and further negotiation may not be worth the risk.  Bob's offer is closer to your minimum price and a guaranteed sale. It's better to secure the sale at a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal altogether."
