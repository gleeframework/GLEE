"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm hoping to get the price down a bit further.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your intent to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $850,000 is still a good deal for Alice, considering her minimum value is $1,200,000. 
* **Motivating Message:**  The message emphasizes your interest in the product while clearly stating your price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get the price down, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer.  $875,000 is a good price, and accepting now saves you time and potential further negotiation. You've already saved a significant amount from the initial price, and it's likely that continued negotiation will only result in small incremental changes."
