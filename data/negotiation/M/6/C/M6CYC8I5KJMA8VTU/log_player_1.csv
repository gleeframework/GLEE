Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $15,000, Alice aims to secure a price as close to that as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 leaves a small buffer for potential negotiation while still staying significantly above Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Option:** Alice has the security of John's offer ($10,000) if Bob declines. This allows her to confidently aim higher with Bob."
