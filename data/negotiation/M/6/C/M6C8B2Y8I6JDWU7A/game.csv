"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  I think that's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $975,000. I think this is a fair price that still allows for a good profit for both of us. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit high at $975,000, but I'm willing to go to $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a good profit for both of us. Let's try to close this deal!",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000.
