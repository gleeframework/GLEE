"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still too high.  Since I have 10 rounds, I can try to negotiate a lower price.  It's likely Alice will be willing to come down a bit, and I don't want to risk missing out on a better deal by accepting this early on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  I think that's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $975,000. I think this is a fair price that still allows for a good profit for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $975,000 is still above my target. I'm confident I can get it lower, as she's already shown a willingness to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer again to try and close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit high at $975,000, but I'm willing to go to $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a good profit for both of us. Let's try to close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a good profit for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $950,000, which is getting closer to my desired price point. We've both shown flexibility in the negotiation, and I'm confident I can't squeeze much more out of Alice.  Considering I have a backup option with John at $1,500,000, accepting this deal saves me $550,000.  It's time to close and lock in this price."
