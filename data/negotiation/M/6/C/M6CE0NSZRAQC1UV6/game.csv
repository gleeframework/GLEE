,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and the potential it holds for your business.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,025,000.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which reflects the value I see in this product while remaining within my financial constraints. I believe this represents a fair compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  To demonstrate my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $975,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which represents a substantial commitment from my side.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm proposing a final offer of $960,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us given the value this product brings.",960000.0,Alice,7,
