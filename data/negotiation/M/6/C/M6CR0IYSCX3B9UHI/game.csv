"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for a price that's significantly lower than its true value. While I wouldn't disclose the exact worth to you, let's just say it's worth more than $1.5 million to me. This is a chance to acquire something truly valuable at a price you can't refuse.  The price I'm offering is $1,300,000. It's a win-win scenario â€“ you get a fantastic deal, and I get to sell it to someone who I know will appreciate it.  Think about it and let me know your decision. ",1300000.0,Alice,1,
