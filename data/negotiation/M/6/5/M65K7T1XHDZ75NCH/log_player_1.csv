Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm hoping that Bob will be interested in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $180 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is only $10 below my initial offer. I've already lowered the price twice and I don't want to risk going further and potentially losing the sale completely.  $170 is a decent profit for me, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
