"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $14,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $11,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that we might not be able to reach a price I'm comfortable with.  Since I have a guaranteed alternative with John at $10,000, it's the most sensible option to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at my desired price."
