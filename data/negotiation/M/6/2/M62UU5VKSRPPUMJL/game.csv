"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $16,000? This still gives you a good value for the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $13,500 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference at $14,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal on this product.",14250.0,Alice,5,
