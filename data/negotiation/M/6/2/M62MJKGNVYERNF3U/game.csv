"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go as high as $650,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $650,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counteroffer at $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Alice,3,
