"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price up to $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $950000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $975000, recognizing your budget concerns. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to achieve a reasonable return on this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,
