Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll likely see."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving us a strong negotiating position.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence can make Bob more likely to accept the offer. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, leading you to accept the $800,000 from John.  If you want to guarantee a sale, a lower initial offer closer to $1,000,000 might be safer, though less profitable if Bob is willing to pay more."
