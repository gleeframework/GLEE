Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting at $1,350,000, I'm aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value while staying significantly above my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Leaving Room:** It's unlikely Bob will accept my first offer, but it sets a strong anchor.  I'm prepared to negotiate down, but I want to gauge his willingness to pay.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 gives me a strong bottom line. I won't accept anything less from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a substantial sum, it's still $150,000 below my initial asking price and leaves a significant amount of potential profit on the table. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter to see if I can nudge him closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $1,275,000 is more reflective of that. It's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down from my initial offer, signaling flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price above the midpoint between our previous positions. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to subtly remind Bob of its worth.
* **Confidence:** I'm projecting confidence that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000 for the product. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly committed to staying below $1,250,000. While I could push further, his offer of $1,225,000 is a strong price and a good compromise. It exceeds my minimum sale price by a significant amount and represents a successful negotiation. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiation stalling or losing Bob entirely."
