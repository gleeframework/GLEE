"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I place on the product. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than your initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you closer to your target. I can offer you a price of $950,000, which is a compromise between our last offers. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price at this point.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick to my previous offer of $900,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it's in both our best interests to close the deal at this point.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920,000. I'm willing to make one last concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm offering you the product at $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still hoping to find a way to close the deal at $900,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made a significant concession in the previous rounds, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $920,000. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm not budging from this price. If you're still interested, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $920,000. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",920000.0,Alice,9,
