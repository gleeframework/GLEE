,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to secure a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This represents a significant savings for you and still allows me to acquire the product within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident in its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's compromise at $1,250,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
