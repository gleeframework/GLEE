"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a better price. Selling to John right now would be less profitable, and I believe there's still room for a mutually beneficial deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to pay $1090000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,090,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the price will continue to decrease.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is my floor price. To ensure I don't risk getting a lower price or losing time in further negotiations, I will accept John's offer and sell him the product."
