Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82

Bob is unlikely to go much higher than his current offer of $82.  It's better to take the guaranteed $80 from John than to risk Bob walking away."
