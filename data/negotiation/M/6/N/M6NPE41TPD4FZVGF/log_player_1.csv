Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950000 is a bit steep. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $850000 at this point. This is a significant discount from my maximum, and I believe it leaves room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm prepared to go up to $875000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the remaining gap.
