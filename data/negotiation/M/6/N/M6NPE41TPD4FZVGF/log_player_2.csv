"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties. Let me start with a price of $950000. This is slightly above my cost but well below market value considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice is asking for $950,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so rejecting the offer allows for potential savings. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** You have this option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000 at this point. This is a significant discount from my maximum, and I believe it leaves room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $900000. This is a compromise between our previous positions, aiming to find a fair solution for both of us. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point.
* **You have room to negotiate further.** You've already established a lower price range, and Alice is clearly willing to compromise.
* **Buying from John remains a viable alternative.**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you can still purchase the product from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm prepared to go up to $875,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the remaining gap."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. Based on our negotiations so far, I would like to propose a price of $890000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you and the costs involved. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your target price.**  $890,000 is only $20,000 away from your ideal price of $875,000.
* **There's a risk of continuing.**  If you reject the offer, you're not guaranteed a better price from Alice. You also risk running out of rounds.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  At this point, accepting Alice's offer is a better financial decision than buying from John.

**It's important to consider that you're not always going to get the absolute best deal. Sometimes, it's better to secure a good deal rather than risk losing out on the product entirely.**"
