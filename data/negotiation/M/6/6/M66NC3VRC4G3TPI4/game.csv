"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's in excellent condition and worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's still a good deal for a product that's worth $100 to you.  Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $97.50 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and do $101.25?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $101.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $99, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",99.0,Bob,6,
