"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $75 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  Let me know what you think.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $80?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
