"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit.  I believe this is a reasonable starting point considering my product's worth to me and Bob's potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm countering with $160. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $145 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to go even higher. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $155.  This is a significant concession, but still above my minimum. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway to close the deal.  If he rejects, I will seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum, but I've already invested time and effort in this negotiation.  With only four rounds remaining, I'm not sure if I can get a higher price. Since I have a guaranteed sale to John at $150, I'm going to take that option and avoid any further risk."
