Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible, but I'm also aware that John is a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hopeful I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is still below Bob's perceived value, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm not sure if another counteroffer will be successful. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
