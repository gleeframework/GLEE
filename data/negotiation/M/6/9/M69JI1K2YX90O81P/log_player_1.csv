{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us - a good price for you, and still a significant profit for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for both of us, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hardline, leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer. 

**Next steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider:

* **Lowering my price slightly:** Depending on his counteroffer, I might be willing to drop the price a bit further to secure a sale.
* **Sticking to my initial offer:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I might stick to my initial price or even increase it slightly, as I can always sell to John for $1,000,000.
* **Ending the negotiation:** If I feel like I'm not getting a fair price and Bob is not being reasonable, I will move on and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $900000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial situation. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum:** While closer to my desired price, $850,000 is still below my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Opportunity to increase the price:**  I believe I can potentially secure a better price. 
* **John as a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept a below-par offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his offer but still lower than my initial price. I'll aim for a compromise between our two positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is unfortunately still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  This gives you a good deal on the product, and allows me to secure a fair price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows I'm taking his offer seriously.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive and encouraging language to keep the negotiation friendly and productive.
* **Focusing on benefits:** I'm highlighting the benefits of the offer for both of us, emphasizing that it's a fair deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects, I might consider:

* **Lowering my price slightly:** I might be willing to drop the price a little further, depending on his counteroffer and how close we are to reaching a deal. 
* **Sticking to my offer:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I may maintain my current price and continue to negotiate.
* **Selling to John:**  If I believe we won't reach a fair price with Bob, I'll move on and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued patience and understanding, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to increase my counteroffer to $860000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product and my financial capacity. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $860,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, we're still too far apart.
* **Room for improvement:** There's still some wiggle room to increase the price, and I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly below my target.
* **John is a safe option:**  I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer again, but this time I'll aim for a smaller increase. I'll propose a price slightly higher than his offer, perhaps $865,000, to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I value your business, $860,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm confident this product is worth more to you than that, considering its potential.  Would you consider a price of $865,000? This small increase will allow me to accept your offer, and I believe it's still a fair price for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 865000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm raising the price only slightly, by $5,000,  to show that I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to accept. 
* **Focus on Closing:** I'm using language like ""close the deal"" to signal that I'm ready to wrap up negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts this offer, I'll finalize the sale.
* **Rejection & Final Offer:** If Bob rejects, I'll make one final counteroffer of $870,000. If he rejects again, I'll move on and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts in reaching a mutual agreement. Based on my calculations and the value I place on the product, I am willing to pay $855000 for it. I believe this price strikes a balance between the product's worth and my budget constraints. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations and we can conclude our negotiations successfully. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $855,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $855,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too far apart:** Bob's offer of $855,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It seems like we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John is a better option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation. I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll politely inform Bob that I'm going to sell to another buyer but thank him for his time and consideration."
