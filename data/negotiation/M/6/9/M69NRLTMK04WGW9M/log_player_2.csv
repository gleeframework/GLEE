Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its worth.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is getting closer to the mark. However, to be completely transparent, $1,200,000 is the absolute lowest I can go for this product. It's a fair and final offer considering its true value and potential return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice has made it clear that $1,200,000 is her bottom line. Since you can buy the product for the same price from John, there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice. You won't be able to save any money."
