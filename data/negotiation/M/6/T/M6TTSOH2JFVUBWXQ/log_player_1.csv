Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me ($120).  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $115 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $120.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a price of $125, which is halfway between my minimum price and Bob's offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $118 is still below my minimum price of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident I'll be able to get a higher price from Bob. It's better to sell to John for $120 and guarantee my minimum profit."
