Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price you're happy with.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give Alice valuable information. If he accepts immediately, she knows she could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, it opens the door for negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice is secure knowing she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000. This knowledge allows her to be more confident in her negotiation with Bob."
