"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm a bit of a savvy buyer and I've done my research, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $12,500? This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,250? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,250 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be at least at $12,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is a fantastic deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $12,000. How about we meet at $11,750? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.",11750.0,Bob,6,
