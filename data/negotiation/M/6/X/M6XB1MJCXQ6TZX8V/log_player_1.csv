Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Friendly Approach:** Using a friendly tone and emphasizing the product's value can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy balances getting a good price with keeping the negotiation open and potentially getting closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** While $110 is more than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I believe there's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $130.
* **Testing Bob's Interest:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to hold out for a better price. This might prompt Bob to reconsider his offer or make a counter-counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $110 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer offers a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($110). This shows a willingness to be flexible while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the benefit he'd receive at the offered price.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone can help keep the negotiation going and prevent it from becoming adversarial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I don't want to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $115 is still slightly below my ideal price of $130, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and keeps the door open for future interactions with Bob. It's possible he might be more willing to pay a higher price for future products.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of a breakdown in negotiations or having to sell to John at a lower price.  

This strategy balances maximizing profit with minimizing risk and preserving a potentially valuable customer relationship."
