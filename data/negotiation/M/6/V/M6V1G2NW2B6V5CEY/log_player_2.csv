"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what you're willing to pay and significantly higher than what I'd sell it for elsewhere. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get the price down further.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  This still gives you a good profit and keeps me within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is tempting, it's still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $13,750. This still leaves you with a good deal and gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,750 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price, and it's only $250 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in small incremental savings, so accepting is the most logical choice to secure the product at a reasonable price."
