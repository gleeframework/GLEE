You have three options:

It's not a good deal for Bob since the product is worth $12,000 to him.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum value for the product.  By rejecting, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to his target."
