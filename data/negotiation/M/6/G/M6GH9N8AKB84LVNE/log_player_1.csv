Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, based on my current budget and financial planning, I am unable to meet the asking price of $950000. I would like to propose an alternative that might be more in line with what I can afford at this time. How about we aim for $875000? I believe this could still be a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
