{""product_price"": 10000}

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate and hopefully leads to a deal close to his valuation of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer and try to close the gap."

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price."
