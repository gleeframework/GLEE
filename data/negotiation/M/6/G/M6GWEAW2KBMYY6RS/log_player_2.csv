"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further.  He has a clear upper limit of $12,000, so there's room to counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to his ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but he doesn't want to risk losing the deal completely. Offering $9,000 is a compromise: it's a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  If Alice rejects, Bob can still consider another counteroffer or go to John, knowing he has a good starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is within Bob's budget and a good price compared to John's offer.  There's always the chance of getting it even lower, but at this point, the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal to John outweighs the potential gains.  Bob is likely to be happy with this deal."
