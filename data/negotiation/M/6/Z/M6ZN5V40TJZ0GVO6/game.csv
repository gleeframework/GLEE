"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product, and I think it's worth discussing a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you showing me the product. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do something closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I acknowledge the value of the product at $12,000, my absolute top limit is $9,000.  Would that be agreeable to you?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is a compromise I think we can both live with. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm afraid $11,000 is still pushing my budget. My final offer is $9,500. I understand if that's not workable for you, and I appreciate your time.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to $10,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
