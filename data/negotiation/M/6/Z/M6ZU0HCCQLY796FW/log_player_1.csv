Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This price is fair considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still lower than my minimum target of $800,000.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, especially since he acknowledged the value of the product to him.  I want to explore if I can bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirement.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $987,500.  This price is a good compromise that allows us both to make a profit. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $987,500 is getting closer to my minimum target, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I believe there's room for further negotiation.  I'm confident I can secure a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
