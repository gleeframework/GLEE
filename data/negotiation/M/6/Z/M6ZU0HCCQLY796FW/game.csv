"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This price is fair considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirement.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $987,500.  This price is a good compromise that allows us both to make a profit. What do you say?",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $987,500 still falls short of my expectations. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to come down to $1,006,250. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1006250.0,Alice,5,
