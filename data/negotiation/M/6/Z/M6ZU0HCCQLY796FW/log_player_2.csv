"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can aim for a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This price is fair considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirement.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He's already shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice has also moved closer to his desired price. There's still room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $987,500.  This price is a good compromise that allows us both to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 987500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $987,500 still falls short of my expectations. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to come down to $1,006,250. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,006,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,006,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could continue to negotiate, the price is now very close to his desired range, and there's a risk that Alice might become more firm or even walk away from the deal. Accepting the offer for $1,006,250 saves him a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
