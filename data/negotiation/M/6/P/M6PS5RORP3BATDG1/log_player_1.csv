Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $15,000.  Offering it slightly below his perceived value maximizes the chance of acceptance while securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Backup Option:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't need to desperately lowball the price.
* **Psychology:**  The message aims to be persuasive without being overly aggressive. Highlighting ""value"" and ""investment"" resonates with potential buyers."
