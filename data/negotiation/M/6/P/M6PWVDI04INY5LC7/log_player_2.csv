Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $7,200. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```
Reasoning:

At this point, Alice is moving in smaller increments, suggesting she's getting closer to her bottom line. While we might be able to push her down a little further, the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting at $7,200 secures a decent discount without risking the deal by pushing too hard.
