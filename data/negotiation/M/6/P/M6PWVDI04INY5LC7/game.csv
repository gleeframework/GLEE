"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $7,200. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",7200.0,Alice,5,
