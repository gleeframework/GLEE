"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer and for your counter-proposal.

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, there's still a substantial gap between our valuations. To be frank, $2,000,000 is not a price point I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go at this point.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, to be completely transparent, my absolute ceiling for this product is $1,200,000.  If you can meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll have to seriously consider my other options.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
