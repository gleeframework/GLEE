Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to your target, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. My next counteroffer is $1,280,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $1,280,000, which is only $30,000 more than Bob's target of $1,250,000. 
* It's a good compromise and within Bob's budget. 
* Continuing to negotiate might take more time and risk Alice walking away from the deal.
* Buying from John would be significantly more expensive."
