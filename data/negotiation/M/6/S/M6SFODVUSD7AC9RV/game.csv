"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd love to hear if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  While I'm very motivated to sell, that price point is a little too low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $1,275,000? This offer reflects the significant value this product brings.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but I'm afraid $1,275,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to meet you at the midpoint, which would be $1,225,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
