Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,000? This is a great price for the value you'll be getting."", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I still have 6 rounds left and I believe I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about $14,250? This is a fair price for the value you'll be getting, and it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 14250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to be at $13500 or lower. How about $13750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, we're down to 4 rounds left and I'm not sure I can get a higher offer from Bob.  $13,750 is still a good profit for me and it's better than selling to John for $12,000."
