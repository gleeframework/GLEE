{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're serious about selling, but you're also confident in the value of your product.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value.  I believe I can still reach a mutually acceptable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $8,500 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $9,000? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $8,750? It's the highest I can go 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject his offer and make one final counteroffer. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $9,250? This is my absolute final offer. If we can't agree, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 9250}
