Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I believe a price of $12,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll get a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Knowing Your Value:** You know John provides a safety net at $8,000, so you won't accept less. 
* **Bob's Value:** You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, giving you significant bargaining power.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (""given its value"") makes it seem less arbitrary and more palatable to Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that's beneficial for him compared to his perceived value."
