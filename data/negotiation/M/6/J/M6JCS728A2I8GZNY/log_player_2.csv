"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will meet your needs perfectly. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm sure you know its worth significantly more. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, Alice's message hints that she's willing to go lower. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a potential counter-offer closer to her $8,000 value."
