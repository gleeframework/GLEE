Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** This price gives me room to come down a bit if Bob counters, while still earning a decent profit.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a strong bargaining position.  If Bob rejects my offer, I can always fall back on John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a higher price:** There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.
* **John is a safety net:**  If I can't reach a suitable agreement with Bob, I have a guaranteed sale to John at $15,000.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,500.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  $11,500 is a reasonable middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I'm not losing out.

By offering a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm open to negotiation while still maintaining my desired profit margin."
