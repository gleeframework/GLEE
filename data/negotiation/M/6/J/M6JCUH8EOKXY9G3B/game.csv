"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15000.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $11250. Can you consider that?",11250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11000. This is as close as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $8000. I hope this is acceptable to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
