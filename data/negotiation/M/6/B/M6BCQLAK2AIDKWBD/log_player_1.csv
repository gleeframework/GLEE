"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial value of $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I have 9 rounds left and John is willing to pay my minimum, so I can afford to be more patient and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about $10,500? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far apart on the price. I was thinking more in the range of $9,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I still have 6 rounds left and John is waiting to buy the product for $15,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is still not quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? It's a fair price that allows me to make a profit and you to get a good value."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit short. Can you meet me at $9,800? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go all the way to $10,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,800 is the closest Bob has gotten to my desired price, it's still not enough. I have 4 rounds left and John is willing to pay my minimum. I believe I can still get a better price with some more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $10,200? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit and you to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,200. Can you meet me at $9,900? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,900 is tempting, I still have two rounds left and John is waiting to buy the product for $15,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob. It's risky, but the potential reward is worth it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here. You're getting closer, but $9,900 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to make one last concession. How about we settle at $10,100? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 10100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,900. I think that's a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me there. I'd like to close this deal, but I need to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I've reached the final round, and Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer of $9,900.  While this is close to my target, I'm still far from my minimum value of $15,000. It's a tough choice, but selling to John at $15,000 is the best option at this point. I can secure my minimum value and avoid potentially walking away with nothing."
