"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,300,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit, while also incentivizing Bob to seriously consider my offer.  I'm confident in the value of my product and believe it's worth more than $1,000,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,250,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping it's a sweet spot for Bob - enough to incentivize him to buy, but still below what I'd get from John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,225,000.  We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation, and I need to start seriously considering John's offer. This is a compromise that still allows me to profit, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, we're running out of time. John is a sure thing, and I'm confident that I can get the best deal with him."
