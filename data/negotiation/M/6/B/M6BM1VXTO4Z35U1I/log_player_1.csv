"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'll see if I can get a better deal by counteroffering."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,000,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
