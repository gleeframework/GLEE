"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob to make the offer more attractive.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($8,000).**  While it's tempting to sell immediately, I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* **I have 9 rounds left.** There's still time to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open.** This allows me to explore a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This price still gives you a significant saving compared to the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to compromise by offering a counteroffer.
* **Justified Price:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by highlighting the value Bob places on the product and the significant savings he would still enjoy.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue the discussion. 
* **Strategic Price:** $9,500 is a price that is closer to Bob's initial offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to counter with a price of $9,000. I hope this proposal is within your range and helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price range and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited Time:** We are only in round 4, meaning we have 6 rounds left to reach an agreement. Accepting now maximizes my earnings and minimizes the risk of further negotiation.
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:** While I could try to get a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee I'll be successful, and the risk of losing the deal is too high.

**Conclusion:** 
Accepting Bob's offer of $9,000 is the most strategic decision, maximizing my profits while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
