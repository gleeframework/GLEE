Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and your potential return on investment, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $1,000,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high ($950,000) leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency, making Bob more likely to act quickly. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""return on investment"" subtly justifies the high price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at the highest possible price and ensuring the product is sold for at least its minimum value."
