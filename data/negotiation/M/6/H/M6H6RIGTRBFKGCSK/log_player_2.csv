"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's within your budget, it's still more than you'd ideally like to pay. 
* **You have room to negotiate:** You have 10 rounds, and Alice likely wants to sell. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations go south, you can always buy from John.  

By rejecting, you initiate the negotiation and have the opportunity to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Testing the waters:** It's important to start with a strong counteroffer to see how flexible Alice is. 
* **Staying below your limit:**  $750,000 is well within your budget and provides a good starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down:**  This offer is lower than her initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still too high:**  While closer, $850,000 is still above what you're aiming for.
* **Negotiation room:**  You have 7 rounds left, so continuing to negotiate could potentially get a better price.
* **John is still an option:** If negotiations stall, you can always buy from John.

Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice has shown a willingness to lower her price, and this counteroffer is right in between her previous offer and your previous offer. 
* **Testing her bottom line:** This offer may be close to what Alice is willing to accept, especially given her stated value of $800,000.
* **Maintaining flexibility:**  If Alice rejects, you still have room to increase your offer slightly in the next round.

This counteroffer is a strategic move to try and reach an agreement quickly, while still maintaining the possibility of further negotiation if needed."
