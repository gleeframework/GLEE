Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get a good price, while also seeing how interested Bob is in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'd like to try and get more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell at the minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. I'll take the guaranteed $150 from John."
