"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value while allowing us both to make a profit. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a deal, but I'm afraid $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and takes into account your budget constraints. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your efforts to negotiate, $950000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm prepared to pay $925000, which is my final offer. This reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $925000 is the highest price you're willing to pay, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $975000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925000 and $1000000, which is a price that I think is still reasonable considering the product's value. I'll make one last offer of $987500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",987500.0,Alice,7,
