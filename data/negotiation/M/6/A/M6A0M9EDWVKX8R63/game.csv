"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a good deal, but $105 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $110? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $108.75? This is my final offer.",108.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $108.75. I'm willing to go up to $106.25, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",106.25,Bob,6,
