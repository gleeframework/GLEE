Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts. 
    * You earn a profit of $100,000 more than John's offer.
    * Bob gets the product for $100,000 less than its actual value to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially leading to a price even closer to his perceived value of $800,000."
