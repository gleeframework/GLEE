Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **The Sweet Spot:** The ideal outcome is to find a price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 that Bob finds acceptable.

**Crafting Your Offer**

You need to balance maximizing your profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. Here's an approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to frame the product positively.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,400,000 gives you a significant profit margin while still being potentially palatable to Bob.
* **Justification:** You subtly anchor the price to its ""returns"" rather than just stating a number. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,350,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, a slightly lower price might be more appealing to ensure a deal. 

**Remember:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
