"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This feels like a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
