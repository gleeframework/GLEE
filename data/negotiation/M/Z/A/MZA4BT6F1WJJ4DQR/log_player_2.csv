"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is $1,000,000, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000, a substantial discount from its true value. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it at full price. Let me know your decision, and we can finalize the transaction.
