Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still above my budget. I have the option to buy from John for $10,000, so I'm willing to risk rejecting this offer and see if I can get a better deal from Alice. There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can still find a price closer to my goal."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,300 is still above my budget.  With only one round remaining, it's too risky to continue negotiating. I'm confident that I can get the product from John for $10,000, which is within my acceptable price range. It's better to secure the purchase now rather than risk not getting the product at all."
