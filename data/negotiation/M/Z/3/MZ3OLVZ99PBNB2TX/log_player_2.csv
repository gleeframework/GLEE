# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you than buying from John.**  You'd pay $120 from Alice versus $150 from John.
* **You still get a good deal.**  The product is worth $150 to you, and you're getting it for $120, so you're saving $30."
