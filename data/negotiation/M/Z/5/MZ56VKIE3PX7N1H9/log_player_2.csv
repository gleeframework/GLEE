Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think we're getting to the wire. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I'm starting to think you're not serious about making a deal. If I don't see a better offer from you, I'll have to consider other options.

```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her $11,000+ position. At this point, continuing the negotiation risks either overpaying or missing out on the product entirely. John's offer of $15,000 acts as a safety net, ensuring Bob can acquire the product."
