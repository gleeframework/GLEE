"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $75 is tempting, I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $78?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $78 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $82, which is a good compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit short on budget, and $82 is a bit above what I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to consider $79?",79.0,Bob,6,
