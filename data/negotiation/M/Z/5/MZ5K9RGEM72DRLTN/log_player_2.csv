"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's an exceptional value considering its quality and features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since your maximum budget is $120, and John is willing to sell it for that price, it's the most logical choice. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Alice."
