"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its high value and quality, I believe it's worth $95. Would you be interested in making an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're aiming to save as much as possible and are willing to pay up to $100, so $95 is not a good deal. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $95 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is still a fair price for Alice since she values the product at $80. This counteroffer is a significant drop from her original offer and shows that I'm serious about negotiating. I'm also keeping my message friendly to maintain a good relationship."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come up with a mutually beneficial solution. How about we meet in the middle at $90 for the product? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial $95, it's still above my target price. I want to save as much as possible and am willing to go as low as $85. Therefore, I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $90 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $87.50. This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer of $85 and Alice's current offer of $90. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good deal for myself. By stating that this is a ""fair deal for both of us,"" I'm reinforcing that I'm looking for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's aim for a price closer to $85, which I believe reflects the value you're getting from the product. How does $86 sound to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $86 is very close to my target price of $85 and is within my budget of $100. It's a good deal for me, considering the value of the product and the fact that I could always buy it from John for $100.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product and save some money."
