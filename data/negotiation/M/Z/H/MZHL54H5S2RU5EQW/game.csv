"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for your needs. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth a lot more than that. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,750 is a step in the right direction, but it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $10,250? It's a fair price that would allow me to make this deal work. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit away from my target, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm starting to think that we might not be able to come to an agreement.  I'm willing to make one final offer - $10,000.  This is my absolute bottom line.  If you're not able to meet me there, I'll need to consider selling to another buyer. ",10000.0,Alice,7,
