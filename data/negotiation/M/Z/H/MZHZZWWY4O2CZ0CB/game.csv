"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could we possibly settle around $7,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $8,500. This price still reflects the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm confident that you'll find it worth the investment.",8500.0,Alice,5,
