Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial to you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation or acceptance at a price exceeding your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $19,000 creates a perceived higher value while still leaving room for Bob to potentially negotiate if he's interested. 
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out. You have John as a reliable backup to purchase the product at your desired minimum price."
