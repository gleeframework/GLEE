"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is less than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering the product at a price of $9,000?

Alice has lowered her offer slightly, but it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. He should try to negotiate further and get closer to his target of $8,500."
