"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that? I'm serious about buying this product, so let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering the product at a price of $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase. Let me know what you think!",8750.0,Bob,4,
