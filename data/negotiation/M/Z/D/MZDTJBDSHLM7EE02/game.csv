"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I appreciate your perspective, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm open to negotiation but need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we consider $1,000,000? This demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",850000.0,Bob,4,
