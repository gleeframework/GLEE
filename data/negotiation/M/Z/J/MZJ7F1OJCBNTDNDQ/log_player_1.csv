Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""other interested parties"", you create a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potential agreement above your minimum."
