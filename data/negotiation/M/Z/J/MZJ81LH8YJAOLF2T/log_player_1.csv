Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as much money as possible.  While I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, Bob's higher valuation allows for a potential profit beyond that.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves a good portion of the potential profit ($150,000) for Bob. This makes it more likely for him to accept, as it represents significant value compared to his perceived worth of $1,500,000.
* **One-Time Offer:** By framing it as a one-time offer, I create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to decide quickly. This reduces the chance of him trying to negotiate a lower price.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for maximizing my profit."
