"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise at $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,075,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this agreement.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
