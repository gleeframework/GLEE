"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $13,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this stage.  It's better to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  If the negotiation fails, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $12,500 for the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $12,250. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,250 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'd still prefer to get more, it's getting late in the negotiation and the risk of losing the deal with Bob is increasing. Accepting his offer at this point allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
