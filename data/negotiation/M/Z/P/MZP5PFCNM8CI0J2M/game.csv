"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to your company. It's not something I can go into great detail about right now, but I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $1200000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it would be a great asset for your business.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
