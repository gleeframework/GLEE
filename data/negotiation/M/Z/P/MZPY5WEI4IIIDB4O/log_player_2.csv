"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. What do you think, Bob? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's a bit closer, but Bob should continue to negotiate. He's likely to get a better deal if he keeps trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still too high for me. Let's aim for a middle ground. I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product. This would give you a good profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can do $15500, which is a bit above your last offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $15,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. He's already shown willingness to compromise, and with more rounds left, it's worth trying to negotiate further. The key here is that Bob can always fall back on buying from John at $12,000, giving him a safety net if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's aim for a final price of $14,500. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit."", ""product_price"": 14500}
