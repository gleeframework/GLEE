"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you've mentioned you value it at $1,000,000.  Let me know if you're interested. I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You can get the product for your desired price from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and go with the cheaper option."
