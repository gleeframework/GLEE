"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the current market conditions.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,550,000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
