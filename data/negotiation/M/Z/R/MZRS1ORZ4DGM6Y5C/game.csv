"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you're interested in. I'm offering it to you for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's fair considering its value. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15,500? This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit. $15,500 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Could we settle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
