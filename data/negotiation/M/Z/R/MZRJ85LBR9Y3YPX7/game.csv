"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,500.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  That's a fair price, and I believe it's a great value for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",13500.0,Alice,3,
