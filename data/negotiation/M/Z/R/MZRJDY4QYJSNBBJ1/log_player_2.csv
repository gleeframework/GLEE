"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can definitely get it for less than $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is within my budget and a good deal for both of us.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action."
