Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential return on investment you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he can bring the price down a little. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:**  We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. By pricing it slightly below that, we increase the chances of him accepting while still securing a significant profit.
* **Justification:**  Offering a reason for the price, even if it's a general statement about value, can make the offer seem more reasonable and less arbitrary. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale with Bob, rather than resorting to John's guaranteed but lower offer."
