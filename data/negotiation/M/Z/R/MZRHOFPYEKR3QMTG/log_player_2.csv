Alice is now offering a price that's only $50,000 less than what John would sell you the product for.  While there's still potential for negotiation, the risk of continuing to reject offers and potentially ending up with no deal outweighs the potential savings.  

At this point, buying from John is the safer and more predictable option, guaranteeing you the product within your budget."
