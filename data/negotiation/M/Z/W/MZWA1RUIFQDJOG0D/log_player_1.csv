Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me the best chance of getting a high price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Offering $1,500,000 allows for a reasonable counteroffer from Bob while still maintaining a substantial profit.

This is just the first step in the negotiation. I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close but not ideal:** While $1,200,000 is higher than my minimum, it's still below my initial asking price. There's potential to get closer to my desired value.
* **Negotiation is key:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price. 

**Next steps:**

I'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. I'll consider his offer and my goal to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise but not surrender:** My counteroffer of $1,350,000  shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Reasonable expectation:** This price leaves room for further negotiation while ensuring a comfortable profit margin for myself. 
* **Staying firm:**  This counteroffer shows Bob that I am serious about getting a fair price for the product. 

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my desired price and significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with the lower price from John. Accepting his offer secures a good deal with minimal further risk.
* **Strategic decision:**  While I might be able to squeeze out a slightly higher price, the potential gain is not worth the risk of losing the deal completely.

By accepting Bob's offer, I am securing a profitable sale and achieving a good outcome in the negotiation."
