# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get a unique item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can likely get a better price than $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can sell the product to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You can still try to get a better price from Alice. It's worth seeing if you can get her down to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure $9,000 is enough to justify the value of the product, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can do $9,250. It's a bit more than your last offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Alice, $9,250 is a good price and you are getting the product for a significant discount compared to John. It's better to secure the deal now and avoid the risk of further negotiations potentially going sour."
