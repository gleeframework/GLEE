"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet halfway at $1,175,000? That's a significant step up from my previous offer.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,287,500? That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal.",1287500.0,Alice,5,
