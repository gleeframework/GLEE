Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify paying that much.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  It's the absolute maximum I can afford while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's acceptable. Accepting his current offer would mean a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer."
