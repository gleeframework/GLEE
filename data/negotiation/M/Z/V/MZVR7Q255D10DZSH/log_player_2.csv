**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still within the realm of possibility given her valuation of the product. This initial counteroffer demonstrates my seriousness in purchasing the product while also establishing a strong starting point for negotiation."

It's important to be decisive and avoid getting caught in a protracted negotiation that might not yield better results."
