"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  I'm initially offering it at $1,300,000. However, I'm open to discussing the price further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it and my current financial constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm firm on my offer of $850,000. This price reflects a fair value for the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
