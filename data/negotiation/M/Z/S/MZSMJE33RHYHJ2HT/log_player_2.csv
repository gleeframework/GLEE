# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment.
