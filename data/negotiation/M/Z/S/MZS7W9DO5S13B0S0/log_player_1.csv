"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high starting price, but I believe it's justified given the product's value to me. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and gauge his initial reaction to the price. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to test the waters and see how much Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm dropping the price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the product's value to me. I believe this counteroffer strikes a balance between being appealing to Bob while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a respectable offer, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to lower the price again to $1,300,000. This shows continued willingness to compromise, but also reinforces the fact that I'm not willing to go too low. We're getting closer to a possible agreement, and I want to keep the momentum going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 less than what I could get from John.  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob and having to settle for John's offer is too high. It's time to take the deal and secure a sale."
