It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $115 is closer to your target, but you can likely still get it down further."

Alice is not willing to go lower than $117, which is still more than you'd like to pay. At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for $120. You've already spent a significant amount of time negotiating and you're unlikely to get a better price from Alice."
