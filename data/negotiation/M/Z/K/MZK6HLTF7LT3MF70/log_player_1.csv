Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so $950,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  $950,000 is still significantly more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It's a clear signal of your intentions:** You're not giving the product away, but you're open to negotiation.

It's important to remember that you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering it's worth $1000000 to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm confident I can get a better price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer is strategic:

* **It's a compromise:**  You're showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **It's still within your range:**  $900,000 is closer to your ideal price than Bob's offer.
* **It creates a sense of urgency:**  By offering a ""final"" price, you're putting pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875000?  It's a fair middle ground and gets us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $875,000 is tempting, I'm still not convinced it's the best deal I can get. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push Bob a bit higher. It's getting late in the negotiation, and John is still waiting in the wings, so I need to be careful not to let this drag on too long."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. To make things clear,  $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we split the difference and settle on $887,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us and would hopefully bring this negotiation to a close. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```

This counteroffer is aimed at:

* **Finality:**  This is positioned as your final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:** It shows you are willing to meet halfway again, even if it's a small difference.
* **Potential closing:**  The offer is close to Bob's valuation, making it more likely he'll accept.

Remember, you can always choose to sell to John if this negotiation fails."
