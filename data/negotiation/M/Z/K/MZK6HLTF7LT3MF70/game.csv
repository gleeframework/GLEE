"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering it's worth $1000000 to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875000?  It's a fair middle ground and gets us closer to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. To make things clear,  $875000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we split the difference and settle on $887500? This would be a fair deal for both of us and would hopefully bring this negotiation to a close. Let me know your thoughts.",887500.0,Alice,5,
