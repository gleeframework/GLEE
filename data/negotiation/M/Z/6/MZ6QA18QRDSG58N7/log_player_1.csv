Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, I want to start by aiming higher. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value allows room for potential negotiation if he counters my initial offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm comfortable starting high because I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000 if Bob rejects my offer.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing my potential profit while acknowledging the information I have about Bob's valuation."
