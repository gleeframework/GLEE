# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You're willing to pay $8,000, so Alice's offer is too high. It's better to counter-offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
