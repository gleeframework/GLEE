"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you consider $8,500?  That's my absolute top offer. ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 is my absolute bottom line.  Let me know if you're interested in making a deal at that price.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute final offer. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
