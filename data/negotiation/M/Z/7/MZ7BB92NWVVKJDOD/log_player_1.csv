Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can get the product elsewhere for less. I am willing to pay $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  While $130 is a decent offer, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $135.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I appreciate the reduction in price. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $130 as the final price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up with his final offer, and it's only $5 less than my previous counteroffer.  I'm happy to accept, as it's still significantly more than what John would offer, and it's close to my desired price."
