"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $120 is better than buying from John for $150. 
* Although Alice's price is higher than the product's worth to her, it's still within your budget and a better deal than John's offer."
