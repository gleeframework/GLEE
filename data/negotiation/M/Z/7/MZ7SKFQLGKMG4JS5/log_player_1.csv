"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum value of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.  This should encourage Bob to consider the offer, but also allow for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than I'd like.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum of $11,000.  I want to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, I can't go any lower than $10,500.  It's a fair price, considering what the product is worth to you.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but $9,800 is my maximum. Let's see if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to secure a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're close! I understand you're firm on your price, but I need at least $10,200 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10200} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, Alice. How about we meet at $10,000? I'm willing to pay that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $10,000 is the highest we've reached so far. It's also the price he's consistently stuck to, indicating it's likely his limit.  This would leave me with a profit above my minimum, and we're nearing the end of our rounds.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
