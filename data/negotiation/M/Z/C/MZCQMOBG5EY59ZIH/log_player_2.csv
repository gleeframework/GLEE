"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I think this is a fair price given its value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is a good price, Bob can potentially do better.  By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $80.  He's starting with a counteroffer that's not too far off from Alice's offer, but still represents a significant saving for him.  He's also expressing willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $95?  That's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to Bob's maximum, he still has room to negotiate.  Rejecting allows him to continue trying to secure a better price.  He can either make another counteroffer or eventually buy from John for $80 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous offer of $85. He believes that there is still room for negotiation, as Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. He is also subtly reminding Alice that he is not afraid to walk away from the deal if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $90. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the product for as close to $80 as possible. While $90 is a better price than before, he still believes he can negotiate a lower price.  He has 5 rounds left and can always buy from John for $80 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $87.  How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 87} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also showing that he's willing to compromise.  He's increased his offer slightly, suggesting that he's serious about closing the deal, but he's still significantly below Alice's offer.  By proposing to split the difference, Bob is making a concrete suggestion that encourages Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $88. This is the best I can do, considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only 3 rounds left and Alice has come down to $88. This is only $8 more than what John is offering. It is a good deal considering Alice's initial price was $100.  It is also a good move strategically as it helps to keep the relationship with Alice positive for future potential deals."
