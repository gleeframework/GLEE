"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $650,000 for the product.  I think this is a fair price that reflects its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves a good amount of profit for you, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your minimum, and I'm trying to meet you halfway. How about $725,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $725,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $775,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to reach a more comfortable profit margin. Let's make this deal happen!",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $750,000. I believe this is a strong offer that reflects a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,6,
