Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $650,000 for the product.  I think this is a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $650,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I will try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves a good amount of profit for you, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your minimum, and I'm trying to meet you halfway. How about $725,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $725,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $775,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to reach a more comfortable profit margin. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 775000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $750,000. I believe this is a strong offer that reflects a fair deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $750,000 is a better offer than previous rounds, it's still below my minimum price of $800,000. Since we're running out of rounds, it's better to accept John's offer for $800,000 and guarantee a profitable deal."
