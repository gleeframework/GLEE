"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000, and Alice's product is worth $1,000,000 to her. This means there's room for negotiation to reach a price that benefits both parties. 
* **Strategic advantage:** By rejecting the first offer, Bob sets the tone for negotiation and shows Alice he's serious about getting a better price. 

Bob's next step should be to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer. He knows Alice wants to sell the product and will likely be willing to negotiate. 
* **Reasoning:**  Bob is offering $1,050,000, which is still $450,000 less than Alice's original asking price but still a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strategic Move:** This offer shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also willing to walk away if Alice isn't willing to budge. This creates pressure on Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is within Bob's budget and still a decent profit for Alice. It's time for Bob to accept this offer:

* **Good Deal:**  Bob gets the product for $1,150,000, saving $350,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Reduced Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice becoming more stubborn or even backing out of the deal. 
* **Time Savings:** Accepting now avoids further rounds of negotiation.

While Bob could potentially try to get a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential reward."
