"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal.  You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I see in the product, I'm open to finding a compromise. Would you consider $1,120,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  You're still better off trying to get a lower price than accepting her current offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm willing to come down slightly further, how about $1,100,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a chance she'll hold firm at that price. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $1,000,000. This guarantees you the product at the lowest price and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
