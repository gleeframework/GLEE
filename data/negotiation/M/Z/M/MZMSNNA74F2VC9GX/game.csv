"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I see in the product, I'm open to finding a compromise. Would you consider $1,120,000?",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,120,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000. If that works for you, we can finalize the deal.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm willing to come down slightly further, how about $1,100,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
