"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm open to negotiation, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my desired price and still well below the value of the product to you. Let's try to find common ground.",11250.0,Alice,5,
