"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth more than $12,000 to you. Considering its true worth and the benefits it offers, I am offering it to you for $10,000. This is a special offer tailored to recognize your appreciation for the product's potential impact on your needs. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly using sales tactics to inflate the product's value to you. She even states it's ""worth more than $12,000 to you,"" which contradicts your own valuation.
* While $10,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is motivated to sell, and you have the alternative option of John. 

By rejecting this offer, you can see if Alice will come down closer to her $8,000 value.  Even if she only drops the price slightly, you'll save money compared to John's offer."
