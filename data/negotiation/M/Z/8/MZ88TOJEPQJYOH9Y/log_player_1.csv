Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a better price than John's offer. 

While I wouldn't accept anything less than $15,000, I'm hoping to exploit Bob's potential desire for the product and get a price closer to $18,000.  

Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to risk losing Bob as a buyer and keep negotiating. I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from $18,000 to $16,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to secure a price closer to my desired $15,000 minimum. It's a fair compromise, considering Bob's initial offer of $12,000.  I hope this counteroffer will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's worth accepting his offer rather than risking another round of negotiation. I'm also considering that if I reject his offer, he might back out completely, leaving me with only John's offer of $15,000. It's better to secure a sale now at a slightly lower price than to risk losing the deal altogether."
