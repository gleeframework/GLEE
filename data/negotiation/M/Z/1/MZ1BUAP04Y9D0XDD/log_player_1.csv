"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value. However, my original price carefully considered the product's unique aspects and long-term potential, which justifies a premium. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal while ensuring a fair return on this valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns about the product's unique aspects and long-term potential. However, I still think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products and the value you're looking to get. I'm eager to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but we are still significantly above his perceived value of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, and selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I've considered your perspective carefully. Let's settle this at $1,012,500. This demonstrates a significant movement on my part while recognizing the inherent value of the product. I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1012500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are strategically making smaller concessions now, signaling that we're getting closer to our bottom line.  By meeting in the middle of the previous round's offers, we show flexibility while still aiming for a price above $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you've made a significant concession, but I still think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $987,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products and the value you're looking to get. I'm eager to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently sticking to his pattern of splitting the difference.  While his offer is getting closer to $1,000,000, we still have several rounds left to negotiate, and we have a guaranteed offer from John. It's worth pushing a bit further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I appreciate your understanding of this product's value.  To finalize this, I'm proposing $1,000,000. This offer reflects my strong desire to see you acquire this asset while ensuring a fair deal for both sides."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We've reached a psychologically significant number: $1,000,000.  This is a strong offer, significantly above Bob's perceived value, and positions us well for the remaining rounds. By presenting it as a final offer to ""finalize the deal,"" we add a sense of urgency and increase the chances of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $990,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products and the value you're looking to get. I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is signaling that he's nearing his maximum price by stating he's ""getting close to his limit."" However, his offer is still below our $1,000,000 mark.  We have two rounds left, and it's worth applying a bit more pressure to see if we can extract a slightly higher offer before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both eager to finalize this. Given the value this product represents, I'm prepared to accept $995,000. This is my final offer. It reflects a significant compromise on my end to ensure we reach an agreement today."",
""product_price"": 995000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We are applying pressure by stating this is our ""final offer."" We've split the difference again, moving only slightly from our $1,000,000 stance but leaving Bob with a difficult decision in the final round. He can either accept a price very close to his likely maximum or risk losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $982,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products and the value you're looking to get. I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $982,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $982,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has once again stuck to his pattern and split the difference.  This indicates he's unlikely to go any higher. While $982,500 is a good offer, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. Accepting Bob's offer at this point would mean losing out on a significant amount of potential profit."
