Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** By offering the product at $150, I am signaling that I'm open to negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price between $120 and $150.
* **Consider Bob's valuation:** I know the product is worth $120 to Bob, so offering it at $150 leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a deal if we negotiate down.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John at my minimum acceptable price."
