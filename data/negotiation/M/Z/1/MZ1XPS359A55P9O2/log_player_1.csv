Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since I don't know Bob's value, I'll gauge his interest and adjust my strategy based on his response.  If he rejects, I'll need to consider dropping the price, but I'll aim to stay above my $8,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is a good price, I want to try and squeeze a little more out of Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. It's a compromise, but it still gives me a decent profit, and it's closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping that Bob is motivated enough to close the deal, but I'll be prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is firm at $8,500. While I hoped for more, I've already rejected him once. If I reject again, it may deter him further. Selling to John for $8,000 would be a lower profit, so accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice."
