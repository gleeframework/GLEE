Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, moving the price closer to his $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties (John) creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Why not other prices?**

* **$1,200,000 or higher:** Bob will definitely reject this, as it's more than he values the product.
* **$1,000,000:** This is the absolute lowest Alice would accept, but it leaves no room for negotiation and might make Bob undervalue the product.
* **Between $1,000,001 and $1,100,000:** While these prices could be tempting, they give up a significant portion of Alice's potential profit. 

By starting at $1,150,000, Alice strikes a balance between maximizing her potential profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
