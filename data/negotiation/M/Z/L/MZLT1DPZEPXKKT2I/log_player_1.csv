Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher based on market research and its potential ROI for your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $950,000?"", 
""product_price"": 950000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle at $800,000? This would be a fair price and allow me to make the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has now reached his maximum valuation of the product. It's unlikely he'll go higher. Continuing to negotiate might yield a small increase, but the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from on the price. Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product and its potential benefits for you."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is a strategic move to push Bob towards his maximum while signaling a firm stance. By stating it's the final offer, we increase the perceived value and urgency.  We're still leaving room to accept John's offer if Bob doesn't take this deal."
