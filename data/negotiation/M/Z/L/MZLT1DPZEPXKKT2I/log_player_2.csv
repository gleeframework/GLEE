Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher based on market research and its potential ROI for your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $950,000?

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways away from our ideal price and John's offer. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle at $800,000? This would be a fair price and allow me to make the purchase."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

We're now at the price we can get from John. This offer lets Alice know our maximum, but also gives her a chance to make a final offer if she's willing to come down a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from on the price. Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product and its potential benefits for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is unlikely to go lower and we have a sure thing with John at our target price. It's time to walk away and take the guaranteed deal."
