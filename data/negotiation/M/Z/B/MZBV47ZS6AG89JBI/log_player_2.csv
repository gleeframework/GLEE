"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $13,500? It's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I have to consider my minimum price. I can do $13,900 for you, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,900 is lower than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. 
* This price is also closer to Bob's desired price than Alice's previous offer. 
* It's likely Alice will not go lower, making this a good opportunity to secure the product at a reasonable price."
