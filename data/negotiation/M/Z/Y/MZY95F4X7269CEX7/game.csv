"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget. This product holds value for me, but not at that price. How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation. While $600,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move significantly from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm trying to find a price point that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is the lowest I can go, as I believe it accurately reflects the product's true worth.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
