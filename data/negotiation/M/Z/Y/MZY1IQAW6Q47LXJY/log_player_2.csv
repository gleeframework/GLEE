"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to give you a discount. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  There's potential to negotiate a better price. You can use John's offer as leverage to push Alice down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,025,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, but it's closer to the value you place on the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. However, it's getting closer.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  If not, I'll go with John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'll meet you at $1,015,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can understand my position.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,015,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already made my final offer and Alice is unwilling to budge.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John at my budget limit.  I'm confident that I can find a similar product in the future if needed."
