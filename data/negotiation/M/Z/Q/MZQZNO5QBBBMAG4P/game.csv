"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,300,000?  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and I think it's a reasonable price considering the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
