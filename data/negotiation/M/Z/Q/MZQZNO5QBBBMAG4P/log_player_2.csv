"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,300,000?  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and I think it's a reasonable price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John. It's also a good compromise that allows Alice to make a fair profit. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
