"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to you and allows me to earn a substantial profit.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** Buying from Alice saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You still get a good deal.** Even though you're paying more than the product is worth to Alice, it's still below your maximum budget of $1,500,000."
