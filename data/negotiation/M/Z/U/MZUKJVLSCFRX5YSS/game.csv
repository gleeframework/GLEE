"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $20,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground. How about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still unable to meet you at $16,000. Could we consider $12,000 as a compromise?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is still a bit low for me. What if we settled on $14,000? That's a significant price reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to make a deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for considering my situation. I've reviewed my budget again and I'm willing to go up to $13,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still making a reasonable investment.",13000.0,Bob,6,
