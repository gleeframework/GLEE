Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always beneficial to start negotiations with a strong offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you understand the product's worth. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering the product at $950,000 positions you significantly closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Open Communication:** The message encourages a dialogue and invites Bob to share his perspective, setting the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is above our minimum, it's still significantly below his perceived value and our initial asking price.  There's room for negotiation. We'll reject this offer to signal we're looking for a better deal while still leaving the door open for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's a significant discount off my initial offer and reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Justification:** We're making a significant concession by coming down $50,000 from our initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.  Justifying the price by highlighting the product's value keeps the negotiation anchored around its worth.
* **Middle Ground:**  Offering a price directly in the middle of our previous offer and Bob's counteroffer ($850,000 - $950,000 range) presents a seemingly fair compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:** While we're negotiating, it's important to avoid drastic price drops that might signal desperation. This offer keeps us well above our minimum acceptable price while still aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gain is becoming smaller with each round.  There's a risk that Bob might walk away or we reach a stalemate.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Holding out for a higher price from Bob means potentially losing the guaranteed $875,000. Accepting now secures a good deal.

Overall, accepting Bob's offer of $875,000 represents a strong and favorable outcome in this negotiation."
