"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I'm interested, $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that 150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you a deal at 130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $95? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that 130 was still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm thinking of offering you a deal at 115. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  $115 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that 100 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you a deal at 110. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,7,
