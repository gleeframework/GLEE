"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. Would you like to make it yours?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, though. How about we start with $15000?  Let's see if we can find a price we're both happy with.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $16000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",17000.0,Alice,5,
