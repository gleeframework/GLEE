Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe its value is significant, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, I'm starting with a significantly higher offer to Bob ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Value-Based Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""What are your thoughts?""), signaling my willingness to negotiate if Bob finds the initial price too high. 

**Important Considerations:**

* Bob's willingness to pay above $800,000 is unknown. There's a risk he'll reject the offer, and I'll have to settle for my guaranteed price from John.
* Negotiation is key. Based on Bob's response, I might need to lower the price to reach an agreement, but always aiming to stay above the $800,000 baseline."
