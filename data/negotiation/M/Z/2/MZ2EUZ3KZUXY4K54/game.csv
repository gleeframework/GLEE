"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. ",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be able to sell it quickly at this price.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's make this happen!",95.0,Alice,5,
