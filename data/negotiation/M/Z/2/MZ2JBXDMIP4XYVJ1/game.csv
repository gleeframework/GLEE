"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, while also allowing me to get a better deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $875,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the highest I can go.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $825,000 isn't quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer and come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives me a reasonable profit.  Let's finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy it at this price.",825000.0,Bob,6,
