Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. I know Bob values the product at $120, so $170 leaves room for negotiation while still being above my desired minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is better than my minimum, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $155. This is still above my minimum, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is too low. While I can continue negotiating, there's a risk that we'll end up with an even lower price.  John is willing to pay my minimum, so selling to him is the best option at this point."
