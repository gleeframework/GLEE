"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $160. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price.  You know another buyer (John) is ready to pay this amount. There's no benefit to further negotiation with Bob, as you are unlikely to get a better offer. Selling to John guarantees you your desired profit without the risk of further haggling."
