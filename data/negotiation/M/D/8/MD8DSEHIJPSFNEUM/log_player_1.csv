Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* The message is friendly and inviting, aiming to open a dialogue with Bob and potentially make him feel like he's getting a good deal.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a higher price, I can see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he rejects the offer, I can lower the price gradually, while still being aware that I have a backup option in John, who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's also considerably lower than my initial offer of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer would result in a major financial loss.

**Strategy:**

I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. This will allow me to explore further negotiation possibilities with Bob while keeping in mind the backup option of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000:** This price is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying within my acceptable range.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" for Bob while still highlighting the need for a reasonable profit on my end. It maintains a friendly tone and encourages further discussion.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise price, I aim to:

* **Increase the chances of reaching an agreement:** This shows flexibility and a genuine desire to find a solution that benefits both parties.
* **Maintain my leverage:** Even though I'm lowering the price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, giving me some bargaining power.
* **Keep the option of selling to John open:** This counteroffer is still well above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring that I have a backup plan if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $975,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it is closer to my initial offer and shows a willingness to negotiate, it's still too low for me to accept.

**Strategy:**

I will reject his offer and counter again. I will aim for a price closer to my desired range, but I will also be mindful of not pushing Bob too far away. I need to find a balance between getting a good price and potentially losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference one more time. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,012,500. This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a successful transaction.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,012,500:**  This offer is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,050,000 and Bob's current offer of $975,000. It shows continued flexibility and a desire to find common ground.
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the offer for both parties. It also reiterates the benefits of a successful transaction, reminding Bob that there's still an opportunity to reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** While the price is lower than my previous offer, it is still above Bob's initial offer, keeping some bargaining power.
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  This shows good faith and makes Bob feel like he's being heard.
* **Emphasize the positive outcomes:** The message focuses on the benefits of reaching a deal, hoping to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Maintain a backup plan:** The offer is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a profitable outcome if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $1,012,500, which would be $993,750. Can you consider this revised offer?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $993,750 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While he has shown willingness to negotiate, we're far apart in our valuations. 

**Strategy:**

I've already made significant compromises and it seems unlikely we will reach an agreement. Continuing the negotiation will only waste time and might result in a lower offer from Bob.  Instead of risking a further reduction in price, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000, ensuring my minimum profit."
