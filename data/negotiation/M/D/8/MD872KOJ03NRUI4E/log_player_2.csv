{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer from Alice is way over your budget. You want to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

You're offering Alice $100, which is significantly lower than her initial price but still within your budget. You hope this counteroffer is reasonable enough to start a negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. While you're willing to pay more than $100, $175 is still out of your comfort zone. You'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

You're offering Alice $120, which is your maximum budget and also the price John is willing to sell it for. You're hoping this shows Alice you're serious about buying, but you're not willing to go any higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $155 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you're comfortable with. You're willing to risk going another round to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

You're offering Alice $130, a compromise between your budget and her last offer. You're hoping this shows your willingness to meet her halfway, and that she might accept this price to avoid further negotiation."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. You've reached your limit for negotiation and don't want to risk going further and possibly missing out on a deal with John. It's better to secure the product for $120 from John than risk losing both opportunities by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
