Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's a significant investment, but I truly believe it's a steal at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still offer an attractive deal to Bob.
* **Creating Urgency:** By slightly lowering the price, I'm hoping Bob will see the value and act quickly to avoid missing out. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm secure knowing John will buy the product for my minimum acceptable price if Bob declines."
