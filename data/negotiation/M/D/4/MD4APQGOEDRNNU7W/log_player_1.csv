I'm starting high, at my absolute minimum value. I'm hoping Bob might be willing to go a little higher, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if he doesn't come close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for a loss. I will counteroffer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."

I'm dropping my price a bit, but I'm still holding firm. I'm hoping Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with a significant loss. I'm confident I can squeeze a bit more out of him in another round of negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will be the final offer and we can finalize the deal."
