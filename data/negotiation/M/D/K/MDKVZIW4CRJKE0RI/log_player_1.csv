Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:**  Offering it for significantly less than $9,500 risks losing potential profit, especially since John is a guaranteed buyer at $10,000.

By offering the product at $9,500, Alice creates a win-win scenario:

* **If Bob Accepts:** Alice makes a $1,500 profit, which is a good outcome.
* **If Bob Rejects:** Alice can sell to John at her desired price of $10,000."
