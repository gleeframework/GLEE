Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and make him more likely to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  By offering $14,000, I allow Bob to counter without feeling like he's being squeezed too hard.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while also recognizing the possibility of Bob's counteroffer. I'm aiming for a final price somewhere between $14,000 and my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and also lower than the value of the product to me.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  While I could accept Bob's offer, I believe there's still room to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a higher price and potentially reach a more favorable outcome.
* **Risk of losing John:** I'm aware of the risk of losing John if the negotiations with Bob drag on too long. However, I'm willing to take that risk for now, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my original offer of $14,000, aiming to find a middle ground. I will also consider the risk of John's offer while negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This price still allows you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm aiming to meet Bob halfway by offering $12,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still protecting my interests.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I reiterate the value proposition for Bob, reminding him that $12,000 is still a good deal considering the product's worth to him.
* **Creating urgency:** The message emphasizes the need to reach an agreement, potentially increasing Bob's likelihood to accept.

**Strategy:**

By offering $12,000, I'm attempting to:

* **Close the gap:**  Bring the price closer to my desired range, increasing the chance of a successful negotiation.
* **Avoid losing John:**  Keep the negotiations moving forward to avoid losing John as a potential buyer.

I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his reaction."
