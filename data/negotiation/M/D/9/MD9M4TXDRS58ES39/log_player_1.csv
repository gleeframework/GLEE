Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I need to offer Bob a price lower than that to incentivize him.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I want to maximize profit, starting too high might scare Bob away.  Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price allows for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant gain. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** The $14,999 price point feels significantly lower than $15,000, potentially making it more appealing to Bob."
