"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves some room for profit for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm trying to make this work but need you to meet me closer to my budget.  How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $950,000 is just not feasible for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're serious about making this deal, I believe this price is fair for both of us. Let me know your final decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
