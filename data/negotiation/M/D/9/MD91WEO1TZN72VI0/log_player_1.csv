Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low for me. I am not willing to sell the product for less than $1,000,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $950,000 is just not feasible for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're serious about making this deal, I believe this price is fair for both of us. Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
