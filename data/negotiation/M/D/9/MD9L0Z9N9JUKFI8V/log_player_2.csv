"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is exactly what the product is worth to her.  There's no immediate incentive to accept.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in getting a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's potential to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
