"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $1,100,000 is a good profit, we're still significantly below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob than John's $800,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to move a bit on price, but $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer:

* **Shows Flexibility:**  We're not stuck at our initial price, signaling to Bob we're willing to negotiate.
* **Aims High:** $1,200,000 keeps us significantly above our minimum acceptable price and closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Compromise:**  Meeting in the middle can be a persuasive negotiation tactic, suggesting fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? I think that's a more reasonable price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more. I'll hold firm to push for a price closer to $1,100,000.  We're still early in the negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to work within a budget, and I respect that. Let's make this work - how about $1,150,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your position."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're holding our ground closer to our desired price while still offering a compromise.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the product's value justifies the higher price.
* **Creating Urgency:**  As we get closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, introducing a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,075,000? I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,075,000 is a significant profit margin above our $800,000 minimum. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but those increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a much higher price.
* **Time Value:** We're past the halfway point in negotiations. Dragging it out risks losing Bob without a significant price improvement guarantee."
