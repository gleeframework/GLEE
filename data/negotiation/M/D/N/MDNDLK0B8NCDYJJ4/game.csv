"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I could purchase it from John for the same price. Let's finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
