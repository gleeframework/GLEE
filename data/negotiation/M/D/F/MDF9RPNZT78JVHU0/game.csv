"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $22000. I think it's a fair price considering its quality and rarity. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $22000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $15000, as it's worth more than that to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $19000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $19000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $17000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider my offer of $17000?",17000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $17000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $18500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,5,
