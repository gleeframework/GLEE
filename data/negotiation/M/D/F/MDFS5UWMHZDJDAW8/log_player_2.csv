"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial value, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer and is closer to my budget. It also leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. It's actually higher than her initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm getting closer to my limit. If she doesn't come down significantly, I'll likely buy from John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $875,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still firmly within my budget. It also gives Alice some room to negotiate if she wants to come down a bit more. If she rejects this offer, I'll likely buy from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffers are consistently above my budget, and it seems she's not willing to budge much. At this point, it's becoming clear that I'm unlikely to get a better deal from her. To avoid wasting further time and ensure I get the product within my budget, I'm choosing to buy from John."
