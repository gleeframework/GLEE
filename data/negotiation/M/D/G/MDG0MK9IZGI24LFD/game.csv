"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider $11,500.  This feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I have a strict budget, and $11,500 is still outside what I can do.  Would you consider $7,000? That's a significant offer on my end.",7000.0,Bob,4,
