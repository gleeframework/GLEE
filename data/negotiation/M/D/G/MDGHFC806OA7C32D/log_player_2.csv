"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still get the product for cheaper than $110, and you're not losing anything by rejecting this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point because it's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still might be appealing to her since it's higher than your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still willing to try and negotiate further.  There's a chance Alice might lower the price again, and I want to see if I can get it for closer to $90."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $95. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high for me. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  He's offering a much better price, and I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a higher price after further negotiation."
