"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly exceptional product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. This product offers significant inherent value. I'm open to negotiation, but  $1,500,000 is below its true worth.  How about we settle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,250,000. Can we get closer to a deal?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While your offer is tempting, the product's intrinsic value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you agree?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my best offer, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I need to be firm on this. I can't justify letting go of this product for anything less than $1,325,000. It's a final offer - let's wrap this up and make this a win-win.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1,200,000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
