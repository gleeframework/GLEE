Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a good value for the product.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $875,000.  It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000."
