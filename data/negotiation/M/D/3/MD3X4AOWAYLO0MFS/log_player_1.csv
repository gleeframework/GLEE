Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob accepts, I'll make a good profit. If he rejects, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it shows a willingness to negotiate. If Bob still rejects this offer, I will be forced to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I am close to my minimum acceptable price,  I believe we can still reach a higher agreement. I will counter-offer again and see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but still within my desired price range. If Bob accepts, we can finalize the deal. If he rejects, I will be forced to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, his last offer is too low. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal entirely. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and allows me to move on."
