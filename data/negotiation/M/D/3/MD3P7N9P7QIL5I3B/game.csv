"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $16,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $14,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My revised offer is $13,750 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value it brings.",13750.0,Alice,5,
