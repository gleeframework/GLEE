"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product for a great price. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $16,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $16,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant jump down from Alice's initial price. It shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to start with a strong offer. This is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $14,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a step in the right direction, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down further. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a more moderate step down from Alice's offer than Bob's previous one. It demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway while still staying within his budget. This approach suggests Bob is serious about reaching an agreement and is ready to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My revised offer is $13,750 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's budget of $12,000. While it's a slight improvement, it's not enough to justify continuing the negotiation.  There are only 5 rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will come down to Bob's target price within that time.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John at his maximum budget of $12,000.  It's a sure deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation dragging on without a satisfactory outcome."
