"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to me.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This price is still fair for both of us, as it leaves you with a decent profit while allowing me to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant step closer to your offer. This price allows both of us to make a good deal while staying within our respective budgets.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $15,000, which is a significant step towards your offer. This price is a fair middle ground, allowing you to make a reasonable profit while staying within my budget. Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiations.",15000.0,Bob,6,
