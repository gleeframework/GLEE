# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $100. I'll offer you the product for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with this price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like the way you think! $105 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'll offer you a slight adjustment to $108. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $108. Accepting this offer gets you a reasonable price without risking going over budget with further negotiation."
