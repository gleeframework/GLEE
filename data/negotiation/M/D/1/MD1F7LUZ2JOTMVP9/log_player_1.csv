Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this is a fair starting point, as it is also below the product's value to Bob ($150)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
