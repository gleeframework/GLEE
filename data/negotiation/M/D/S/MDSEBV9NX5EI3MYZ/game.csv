"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit outside my budget.  How about $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,5,
