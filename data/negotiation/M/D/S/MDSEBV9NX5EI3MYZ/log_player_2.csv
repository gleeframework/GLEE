# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $650,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's offer."
