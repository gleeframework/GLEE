Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something you're interested in, and I believe it could be highly valuable to your operations.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, starting high leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a price closer to your $1,500,000 safety net.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might be even higher than Bob's estimate, justifying the high price. 
* **Urgency:**  Offering an ""exclusive opportunity"" creates a sense of scarcity and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**The goal is to find a balance:**

* **Too high:** Bob will likely reject the offer, and you'll get your guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.
* **Too low:** You miss out on potential profit Bob might be willing to pay above $1,000,000. 

This offer strategically aims for the higher end while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Bob."
