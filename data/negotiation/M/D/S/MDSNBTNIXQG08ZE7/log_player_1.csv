{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but gives him room to negotiate. It also allows me to get a good price while keeping the option to sell to John for $12,000 if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $9500 for your product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it is still below my minimum threshold of $12,000. I will counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I understand your position, I'm still aiming for a bit higher than $9,500. How about $11,000? It's a fair price, and it allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, but still below my ideal price of $12,000. I believe it is a reasonable offer that could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and while I appreciate your effort, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose $10500 for the product. This price aligns better with my financial situation and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below my desired price point. I will counteroffer again to see if I can close the gap.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,500.  This is a fair price that's within both our budgets. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

This offer is another compromise. It is lower than my previous offer but still above my minimum threshold and closer to Bob's offer. I believe this counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate and could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $11000 for the product. This brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum threshold.  I've reached a point where further negotiation may be fruitless, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and allows me to secure a decent profit."
