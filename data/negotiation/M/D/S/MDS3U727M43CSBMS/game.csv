"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I acknowledge your budget constraints, $1,450,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the value to you.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000 for this product.  This is a good compromise for both of us, allowing us to close this deal without further delay. ",1550000.0,Bob,4,
