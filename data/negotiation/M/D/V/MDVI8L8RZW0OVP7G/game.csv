"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't accept $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking more along the lines of $775000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer you the product for $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm eager to finalize the deal and move forward.",815000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but $815000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of $790000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm eager to finalize the deal, but I need to make sure it's a good investment for me.",790000.0,Bob,6,
