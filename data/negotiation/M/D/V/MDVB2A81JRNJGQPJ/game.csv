"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is still fair for both of us, as it leaves you with a significant profit. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is considerably below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,025,000.  This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,025,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price is still below your asking price, but allows for a good profit margin for you. I hope you'll consider this offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement here.  However, the gap between our positions is still significant. To bridge that gap, I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a considerable compromise on my end.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $975,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the product's value.  I hope we can find common ground on this.",950000.0,Bob,6,
