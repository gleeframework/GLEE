"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $125, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $100, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $115. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
