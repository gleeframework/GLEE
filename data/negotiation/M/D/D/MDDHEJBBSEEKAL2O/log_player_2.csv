"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique product with significant potential. I'm confident it can be quite valuable to you. I'm asking for $1000000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is quite high, but it's still below your maximum budget.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating.  $800,000 is still within your budget, but leaves room for further bargaining if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $800000 is a fair starting point, I need to consider the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This gives you a good price and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction.  She has dropped her price to $900,000, which is closer to your counteroffer.  However, there's still room for further negotiation, especially since we have several rounds left. By rejecting the offer, we can continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $850,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer keeps the negotiations moving. We're showing Alice that we're serious about getting a good deal, but we're also not being unreasonable. This offer splits the difference between her last offer and your last counteroffer, signaling a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 doesn't quite reflect the value I know this product can bring you.  Let's meet at $875000.  It's a small step up from your offer, but it allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a significant drop from her initial price and is now very close to your counteroffer.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her walking away or you needing to buy from John at a higher price increases. Accepting this offer secures a good price and allows you to avoid potential downsides."
