"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $10,000 and Alice is offering the product for the same price, there's no immediate benefit to accepting her offer. You can reject and buy from John for the same price."
