"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its quality and features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but could you do it for $80?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  It's strategic to begin with a counteroffer significantly lower than your actual budget. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and potentially meet in the middle. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message expresses interest while making it clear that the initial price is unacceptable. 
* **Aim for a Bargain:**  While your budget is $100, aiming for $80 increases your chances of getting a price closer to your ideal target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $180 is a fair price, I understand your budget might be a bit tighter.  Could you do $140? That's already quite a discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still significantly higher than both your target price and what John offers. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $140 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could we meet in the middle at $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:**  By countering, you demonstrate  you're still interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Counter:** $110 is a strong counter-offer. It's a price that is still appealing to you while being closer to Alice's lowered price.
* **Maintain a Reasonable Pace:** Jumping straight to $100 might seem too aggressive at this stage. A gradual increase in your offer keeps the negotiation moving."
