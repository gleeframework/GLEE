Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is above Bob's valuation but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 
* **Message:**  I'm trying to be friendly and persuasive, emphasizing the value of the product for Bob.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By starting with a slightly lower price, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to negotiate. This also gives me room to make concessions if needed.  However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? I believe this price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $11,250, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating my willingness to negotiate and emphasizing the fairness of the new offer. 
* **Strategy:** By splitting the difference, I'm hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
