Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This gives Bob a good deal if he truly values the product higher, but it also leaves room for negotiation if he's not willing to pay that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer at $140. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than selling to John. I'm hoping this will be enough to persuade Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is only slightly lower than my previous offer of $140. It's getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than selling to John for $100. I'll accept Bob's offer."
