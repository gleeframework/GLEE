"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product is truly valuable and has the potential to generate significant returns for you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1150000.  This price reflects a fair value for both of us, allowing you to secure a profitable asset while I achieve a strong return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing us both to make a profitable deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but  $1050000 is a bit too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This price still allows for a significant profit for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,200,000 and is a better deal than buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge and he'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable purchase."
