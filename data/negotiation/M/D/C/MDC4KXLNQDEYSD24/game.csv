"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,300,000 at this time. This is my best price, and I hope we can find a way to make this work.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  What do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
