You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $95. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!

You can still do slightly better than $90. You are willing to pay up to $100, so you should continue to negotiate with Alice."
