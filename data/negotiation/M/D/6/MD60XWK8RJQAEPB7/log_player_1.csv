Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it would be a great fit for you too. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price. $8,000 is too low, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested! $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my valuation."", ""product_price"": 10000}
