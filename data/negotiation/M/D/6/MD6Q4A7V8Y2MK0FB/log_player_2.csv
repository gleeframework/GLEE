"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has immense value for your business, and I'm offering it to you at a price point that reflects its potential. I'm asking for $1150000.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to stay within a certain budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit while still fitting within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1050000 is a good starting point, I'm willing to come down a little further to $1100000. This still allows me to make a fair profit while recognizing your financial limitations.  I'm confident this is a price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price point and within his budget.  While he could try to negotiate further, accepting at this point saves time and ensures he gets the product at a good price. There's always a risk of Alice rejecting a counteroffer, and it's possible Bob might end up buying from John for $1,200,000."
