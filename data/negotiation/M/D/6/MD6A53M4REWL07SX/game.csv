"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $500000 for it. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits and my budget constraints.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500000. Considering the product's value and potential benefits, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $675000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your budget constraints and the product's worth. I believe this price is still a great deal for both of us.",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $675000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $600000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial agreement.",600000.0,Bob,4,
