"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth $8,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice is asking for more.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $7,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his ideal price, he can still try to negotiate lower.  There's still a gap between their desired prices, and more room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is my maximum. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is your maximum, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go up to $8,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. 

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, she is still asking for more than Bob is willing to pay. He has already made his maximum offer, and there is no guarantee that Alice will accept his next counteroffer. 

By purchasing the product from John, Bob can secure the product at his maximum price point without risking further negotiation and potential deadlock."
