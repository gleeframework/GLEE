"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth $8,000 to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $7,500. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is my maximum. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is your maximum, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go up to $8,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
