``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's a reasonable starting point, higher than my minimum, but hopefully, it will leave room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not going to sell it for $70. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm dropping the price to $100, which is still higher than my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than $70, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to lower the price to $90.  It's a smaller step down than before, and hopefully, it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I also believe the product is worth more than $80."
