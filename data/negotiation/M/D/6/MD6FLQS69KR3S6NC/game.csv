"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $170? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",170.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $155? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. This is my final offer, though - if you're not willing to meet me at $155, I'll have to consider other options.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $155 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $155, which would be $142.50. Would you be willing to consider this price?",142.5,Bob,6,
