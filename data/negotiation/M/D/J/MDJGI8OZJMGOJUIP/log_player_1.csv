Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, he's doing so in relatively small increments. At this pace, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering ($1,000,000).  The risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower offer isn't worth the difference."
