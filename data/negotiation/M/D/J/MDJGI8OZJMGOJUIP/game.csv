"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. This reflects the maximum value I see in the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's unique qualities and potential warrant a higher investment.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This price reflects a significant discount from your last offer and is still within my budget.  I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this point.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to find a middle ground here, but the $950,000 offer is still too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,100,000. This is my best and final offer. It represents a significant reduction and reflects my strong desire to see this product in your hands.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While your latest offer is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. I'm confident that we can find common ground. I'm willing to offer $975,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. I truly believe this product holds significant value for my business and I'm eager to close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
