"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500. If you're not willing to come down any further, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $9,500, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  If that's acceptable, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
