"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you seeing the value in the product. However, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects its value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $9,500.  This is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I can reasonably pay.  I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $9,500.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I'll need to move on to another seller.",9500.0,Bob,6,
