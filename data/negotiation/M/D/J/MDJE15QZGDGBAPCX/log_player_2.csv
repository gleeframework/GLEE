Alice is still asking too much.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since we know John will sell it for $8,000.  There's room for a better price."

While $10,500 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's worth one more try to negotiate a better price before going to John."
