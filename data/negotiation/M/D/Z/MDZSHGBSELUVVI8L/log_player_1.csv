This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly higher than your minimum value. This allows for room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while also showcasing your confidence in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter his offer to see if we can meet in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $900,000. I'm willing to come down a bit to $950,000,  which is a fair compromise. I'm confident this product will provide you significant value, and this price reflects its potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950000. I was thinking more along the lines of $920000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my desired price and significantly higher than selling to John. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potential loss."
