"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:** $12,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's value, but still below my minimum.
* **Openness:** I'm using a friendly tone and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price and significantly below what John is offering. 
* **More negotiation room:** I believe there's still room for a better price. I can counter with a price closer to my desired price and see if Bob is willing to compromise further. 
* **Not worth risking John:** I'm not willing to risk losing out on the higher offer from John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. That's a fair price, and I'm confident this is a product you'll value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing a willingness to compromise while still keeping my price above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth and potential value to him.
* **Maintaining my ground:** I'm not going to accept a price that's too low, even if it means risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $11,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us, and it gets us closer to closing this deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer and his previous one.
* **Closing the deal:** Accepting this offer ensures a deal and avoids risking further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or even a broken deal. 
* **Time is of the essence:** While John is offering a higher price, accepting Bob's offer means a quicker sale and less risk of something happening to prevent the John deal."
