"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $12,000 is still a bit high.  Rejecting the offer gives you more leverage to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. That's a fair price, and I'm confident this is a product you'll value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to your budget, you're still looking to save as much as possible. You can likely get a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $11,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us, and it gets us closer to closing this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
