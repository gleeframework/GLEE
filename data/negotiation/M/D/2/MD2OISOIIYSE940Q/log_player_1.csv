"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation and potential for a win-win situation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm offering $8,500. This is a compromise, as it's still higher than my minimum price but lower than my initial offer. I hope to find a middle ground with Bob in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same as what John is offering. It's a good deal for me, so I'll accept it."
