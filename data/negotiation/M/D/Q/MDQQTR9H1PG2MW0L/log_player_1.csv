{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still getting a good deal.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message concise and friendly, focusing on the value of the product and encouraging a response. 

**Strategy:**

* **Start high, but be reasonable:** I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate. 
* **Be ready to counter:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to lower the price slightly, but I won't go below my minimum. 
* **Don't be afraid to walk away:** I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. This gives me leverage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1100000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).**  While it's tempting to take the $1,100,000, I'm holding out for a better deal.
* **I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum.** This gives me leverage to continue negotiating with Bob. 

**Next steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I might offer a price of $1,200,000 or $1,250,000. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering the price to $1,200,000, which is still above Bob's offer but significantly closer to his price point. 
* **Message:** I'm being polite but firm, acknowledging Bob's position while reaffirming my own. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to reinforce my pricing. 

**Strategy:**

* **Show flexibility:** Lowering the price shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain leverage:**  $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, allowing me to maintain some leverage.
* **Encourage a deal:** I'm emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob rejects my counteroffer:** I will likely make another counteroffer, possibly lowering the price again, but I won't go below $1,150,000.
* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price for the product.
* **If negotiations stall:** I'll go ahead and sell to John for $1,500,000."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I think this is a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,250,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm not willing to budge too much further. 
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's compromise while emphasizing the value of the product and reiterating that $1,250,000 is a fair compromise.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** By increasing my counteroffer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate and willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** The offer of $1,250,000 is a compromise that allows both parties to gain something.
* **Keep Negotiations Open:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and potential agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob rejects my counteroffer:** I'll assess the situation. If Bob doesn't show much willingness to come up in price, I'll likely move forward with selling to John for $1,500,000.
* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a good price for the product while maintaining a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still not willing to pay $1250000. I'm willing to go up to $1170000, but no more. I think this is the highest I can go and still stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,170,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,170,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).** It's clear that he's not willing to meet me halfway. 
* **I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum.** This gives me a guaranteed way to get a good price for the product. 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. The potential gains from continued negotiation are minimal, and the risk of further delays or a lower price is too high. 

Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation headaches."
