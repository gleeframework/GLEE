"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! While the product sounds interesting, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  Let's try $15500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing us to close this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15500. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $16200. This is still a competitive price, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",16200.0,Alice,5,
