"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,200. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, there's still a bit of room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,100. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,100, which is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his target than John's offer of $12,000.  There's a good chance that rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate will lead to a lower price. However, there's also a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price. Since the difference between Alice's offer and John's offer is only $900, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a relatively good price."
