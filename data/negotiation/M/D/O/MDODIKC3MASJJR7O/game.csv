"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable price would be $11000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable price would be $10500. I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $10500. I'm willing to compromise, but I think a more reasonable price would be $11500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10000.
