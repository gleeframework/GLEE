"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its immense value, I'm starting the bidding at $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you reaching out. However, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my research on similar products, I'm willing to offer $1,600,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while leaving room for us both to make a fair deal. ",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 undervalues the product's unique qualities and potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000. This offer represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high.  I'm happy to offer $1,800,000 for the product. This price recognizes the value you've described while being within my financial range.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,900,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,850,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
