"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is significantly closer to my desired price of $1,200,000. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the deal for both of us. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, I'm leaving room for negotiation in case Bob is hesitant to agree immediately. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while also keeping the negotiation process going.  I'm starting high to see if I can get close to my ideal price, but also leaving room to maneuver in case Bob makes a counteroffer. If the negotiations drag on or Bob's counteroffers are unacceptable, I can always fall back on selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While $950,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial counteroffer, it's still far below my desired price range. 
* **Continuing the Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a better deal, especially considering Bob's willingness to meet ""in the middle."" 
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** At this point, selling to John for $800,000 would be a loss for me.  I'm aiming to get as close to $1,100,000 as possible.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell.  This allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price. I'm willing to explore a compromise, but not at the expense of significantly lowering my own earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $950,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm proposing $1,025,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a significant profit.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate my belief in the product's value, reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal even at this price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, encouraging Bob to see this as a fair and mutually beneficial solution.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that is appealing to both parties. By demonstrating flexibility and proposing a compromise, I increase the chances of reaching an agreement quickly and maximizing my earnings. I'm still confident that I can secure a price closer to my desired $1,100,000, but I'm willing to be reasonable to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $980,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  While $980,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I'm willing to settle for. 
* **Continuing the Negotiation:**  I'm confident that I can still push for a higher price, considering Bob's willingness to negotiate and his acknowledgment of the product's value. 
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** Selling to John for $800,000 would be a loss compared to the potential gains of continuing the negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to continue the negotiation, maintaining a firm but flexible stance. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product or significantly cuts into my profits. By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm committed to achieving a fair deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,000,000? It's a good price for you, and I'm confident it's a fair deal considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lowering the Price:** I'm lowering my offer slightly from $1,025,000 to $1,000,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway, while still aiming for a price close to my desired range.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the product's value and highlight that $1,000,000 is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a friendly and positive tone, creating a collaborative atmosphere to encourage Bob to reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to strike a balance between firm negotiation and finding a mutually acceptable price.  By lowering my offer slightly, I signal that I'm open to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the product's worth. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, Alice, but I still think I can do better. Would you be willing to go down to $990,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While $990,000 is tempting, it's still slightly below my desired price range. I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can secure a higher offer.
* **Continuing the Negotiation:** The gap between our offers is getting smaller, which indicates that we're getting closer to a deal.  I want to push for that final $10,000 to maximize my profits.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $800,000 would be a significant loss for me. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob to potentially secure a much better price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to continue to push for a higher price. Bob is clearly motivated to buy the product, and the negotiations are progressing. By rejecting his offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell and that I believe the product is worth more. This approach maintains my bargaining power and allows me to potentially secure a more favorable outcome."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer to a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. How about we meet in the middle at $995,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 995000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's latest offer ($990,000). This demonstrates a genuine effort to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the compromise, suggesting it's a win-win situation for both parties.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly and optimistic tone, creating a positive atmosphere for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy is designed to incentivize Bob to accept the offer.  By meeting him halfway, I'm showing flexibility and a desire to close the deal.  The $995,000 price is a good compromise that allows me to secure a significant profit while still satisfying Bob's needs. This approach maximizes my chances of closing the deal in this round."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, Alice, but I still think I can do better. Would you be willing to go down to $990,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:**  We're now in round 8, and the negotiations have been going back and forth for a while. While $990,000 is not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the potential risks of continuing to negotiate. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will be willing to accept a higher offer in the next round.  It's possible that he'll walk away from the deal altogether, leaving me with only the option to sell to John for $800,000.
* **Securing a Profit:**  $990,000 is still a significant profit for me, and it's a good return on the product.  

**Strategy:**

My priority is to secure a profitable sale.  At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price. By accepting Bob's offer, I'm closing the deal and ensuring a good financial outcome."
