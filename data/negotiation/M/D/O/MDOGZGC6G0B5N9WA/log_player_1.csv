Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems interesting, but the initial price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it, reflecting its value and my budget.  Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but  $900,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,250,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is a significant step in your direction.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,050,000 is a solid win. It surpasses my minimum and provides a $50,000 profit.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me having to settle for John's $1,000,000."
