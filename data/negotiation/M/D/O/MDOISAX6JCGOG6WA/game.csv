"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will be a fantastic investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the immense worth of what we're discussing. ",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the unique benefits this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we try to find a middle ground at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,400,000. However, I believe this is my absolute best offer. This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. ",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you moving on price.  To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer who's offering $1,500,000. However, I believe in being fair and giving you a chance to finalize this.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,7,
