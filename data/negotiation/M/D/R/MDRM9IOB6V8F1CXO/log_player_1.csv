Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I'm excited about the product, but I have a budget to stick to.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,600,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with some negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, which is still a great deal for a product with this much potential. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1800000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the highest I can go.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

It's time to cut my losses.  I've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and we're still too far apart.  I'm not confident I can get to my minimum price with Bob, and I'm running out of time.  It's best to accept John's offer and sell for $1,500,000."
