"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $1,600,000 is not even close to what I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,600,000 reflects the true value and potential this product holds. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still too far from what I have in mind.  To be frank, I'm working with a budget closer to $700,000.  If you can make a substantial move towards that, I think we could reach a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept considering the value this product offers.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
