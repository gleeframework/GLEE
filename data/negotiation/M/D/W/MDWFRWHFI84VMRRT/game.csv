"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me, though. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  That said,  $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
