"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $160. This is a fair price considering its value to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $150. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $160 is higher than your maximum budget of $150. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $150. 

It makes no sense to pay more than you need to. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John and save $10."
