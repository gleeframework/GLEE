"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you.  I propose a starting price of $2,250,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Starting Point:**  Starting significantly higher than both our valuations ($2,250,000 vs. $1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows us to secure a much higher final price.
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing strong belief in the product's value, we aim to influence Bob's perception and increase his willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Open to Discussion:** We don't want to appear inflexible.  The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,875,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,875,000 is a significant increase from his initial valuation, it's still considerably lower than our target price. We have room to negotiate, especially with plenty of rounds left. We'll aim to bring him closer to our desired range with our next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both recognize the inherent value of this product. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $2,050,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and express a desire to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We reduce our price by $200,000, showing flexibility but maintaining a strong position. This keeps the negotiation moving without sacrificing too much value. 
* **Value Emphasis:** We reiterate the product's worth to justify the higher price point.
* **Deadline Awareness:**  We have plenty of rounds remaining, allowing us to make gradual concessions while aiming for a price closer to our initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I still believe we can come to a more reasonable agreement. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, which is a positive sign. We are still in a good position to negotiate further. While his current offer is tempting, we're aiming to secure a price above $2,000,000. We have time and room to maneuver before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and see that you're serious about acquiring this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about splitting the difference and settling at $2,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  By directly proposing a split-the-difference scenario, we signal a strong desire to close the deal while still maintaining a price above both our valuations.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  While we have several rounds left, suggesting a mutually beneficial solution at this point might encourage Bob to accept.
* **Clean Number:** Offering a round $2,000,000 makes the deal seem more appealing and potentially easier for Bob to agree to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is a significant profit above our minimum price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  While we have rounds remaining, prolonged negotiations can lead to increased risk. Bob might become less willing to negotiate further.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting this offer allows us to move on to other potential deals and avoid the risk of Bob walking away later. 

While we could potentially squeeze out a slightly higher price, the current offer represents a strong return and a reasonable compromise."
