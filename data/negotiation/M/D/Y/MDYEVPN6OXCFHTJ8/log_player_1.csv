Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still far below my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, it is still below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there is still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Selling to John now would be the safest option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, which is a significant concession on my part. This price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but I need you to meet me there. Can we meet in the middle at $1325000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,325,000 is still below my minimum.  While I'm willing to negotiate, we've reached a point where continuing with Bob risks running out of time and getting a price that is too low.  Selling to John now guarantees I receive my minimum price, minimizing my risk."
