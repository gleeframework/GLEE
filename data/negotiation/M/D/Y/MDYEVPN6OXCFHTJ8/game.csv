"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1000000. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?,1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept?,1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1300000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1450000, which is a significant concession on my part. This price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but I need you to meet me there. Can we meet in the middle at $1325000?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
