Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to enhance your daily routine and bring convenience to your life. Given its high quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than $100. Would you like to purchase it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget of $100. It's worth exploring the negotiation process and potentially getting a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** We want to start lower than Alice's offer, but not too low to be insulting. $90 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for some negotiation.
* **Emphasis on interest:**  We highlight our interest in the product to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Clarity and brevity:**  The message is clear and concise, focusing on the price point."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $105. This takes into account both the value of the product and your budget. Please let me know if this works for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is still above my budget of $100.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target by making another counteroffer. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to buy from John yet."

Round 4

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** We're getting closer to Alice's price but still within our budget.
