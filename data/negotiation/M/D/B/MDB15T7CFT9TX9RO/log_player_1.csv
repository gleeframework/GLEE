"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $18,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  While I know the product is worth $10,000 to him, I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  I'll be ready to adjust depending on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$12,000 is still significantly below my minimum of $15,000, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I'm confident I can get a better price if I keep negotiating with Bob, or I can always choose to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $16,000. This is a compromise, but still closer to my desired price point.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with more negotiation or by choosing to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm going to make one final attempt to reach my minimum price point. $15,000 is my absolute lowest I'm willing to go. If Bob rejects this, I'll be ready to sell to John."
