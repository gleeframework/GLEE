"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. However, I'm open to discussing a figure that feels right for both of us.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget. While she's open to negotiation, there's no guarantee you'll reach a price you're comfortable with.  Since John is offering the product at your maximum price, it's more prudent to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
