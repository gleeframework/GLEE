{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I believe it holds significant potential for your business, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. While I believe the product's true value is higher, I'm willing to compromise slightly.  I'm proposing $950,000, which represents a fair compromise between our positions. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $925,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $950,000, Bob's offer of $925,000 is still a good deal and above my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him and being forced to sell to John for less."
