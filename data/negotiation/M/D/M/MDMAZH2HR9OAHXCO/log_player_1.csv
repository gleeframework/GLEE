"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a reasonable price, and I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,250,000 is my final offer. This gives you a great deal on a valuable product while still allowing me to achieve a fair return. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more in the range of $1,150,000.  Would that be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is close to John's offer, I'm still closer to my desired price point. There are still a few rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if I can get closer to my target of $1,250,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,200,000. This gives you a substantial price reduction while allowing me to get a reasonable return on my investment. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
