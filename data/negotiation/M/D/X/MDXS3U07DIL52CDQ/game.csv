"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $9500? I believe this would still provide a great value for the product while staying within my financial limits.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9500. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is a compromise that I think still reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my set budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between at $10000? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits.",10000.0,Bob,4,
