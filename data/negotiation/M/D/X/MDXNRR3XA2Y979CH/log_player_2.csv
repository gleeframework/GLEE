"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less than $9,000 from Alice (it's worth $8,000 to her) and he can get it for $10,000 from John.  This means a counteroffer is worth making."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $8,800. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less than $8,800 from Alice (it's worth $8,000 to her).  While he could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go lower, and John is still offering it for $10,000."
