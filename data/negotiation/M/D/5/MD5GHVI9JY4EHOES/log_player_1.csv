Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product to be worth. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,500? That's a significant step towards your offer, and it gives us both something to work with.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is getting closer to what I want, I'm still holding out for a little more. I have a few rounds left, and I think I can push him to $10,500."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to keep costs low. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I would prefer to get closer to my original asking price, I'm running out of rounds.  Accepting $10,000 is better than risking getting nothing if Bob decides to walk away completely."
