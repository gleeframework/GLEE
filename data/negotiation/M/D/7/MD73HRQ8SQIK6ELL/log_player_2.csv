"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. However, I have to consider the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,025,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, but I need to make a bit more to justify the value I've put into this product. I'm counteroffering at $1030000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,030,000 is just $30,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  This is a good compromise, and Bob can likely get a much better price than $1,200,000 from John.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation or a possible price increase."
