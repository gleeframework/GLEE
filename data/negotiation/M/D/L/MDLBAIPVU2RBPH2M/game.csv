"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $7,500?  I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair price for such a valuable product.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $7,200? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I really think this product could be a great fit.",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you on your budget, but I'm still not quite there with $7,200. Let's try $7,350. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you given the value of the product.",7350.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $7,250? I'm really interested in this product and think it's worth the investment, but I need to stay within my budget.",7250.0,Bob,6,
