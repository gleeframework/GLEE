"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. Would you consider $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the limit of our negotiations, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $11,000. How about we meet at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still very interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I've been thinking, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $11,250, just like my previous offer? It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,7,
