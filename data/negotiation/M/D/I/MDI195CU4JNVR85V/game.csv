"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your offer, I see the product's worth closer to $1,450,000. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
