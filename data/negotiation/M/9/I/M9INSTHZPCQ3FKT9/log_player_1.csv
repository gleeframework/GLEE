Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000. This means he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **My Value:** I value the product at $10,000. 
* **John's Value:** I have a backup offer of $10,000 from John.
* **Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 gives me a significant profit ($4,000) while still leaving Bob with a potential gain of $1,000. 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob is still likely to accept the offer."
