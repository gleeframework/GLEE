Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,800,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget constraints.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

While $1,000,000 is a significant investment, it falls quite a bit short of what I had in mind. To move this forward, I could consider $1,600,000. I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However,  $1,600,000 is still a bit beyond what I can justify. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $1,300,000? This would represent a significant investment on my end while still recognizing the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
