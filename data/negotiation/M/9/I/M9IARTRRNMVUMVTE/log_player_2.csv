Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to offer the product at $900,000. This price takes into account your budget constraints while still providing a fair return for our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly in price.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's a real risk she'll hold firm closer to $900,000. Accepting the $900,000 offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of missing out on the product or having to buy it from John for $1,000,000."
