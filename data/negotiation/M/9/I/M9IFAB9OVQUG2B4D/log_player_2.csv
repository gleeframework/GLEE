Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $13,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Reasoning:  Alice is not budging significantly on price. She went up when we were getting close to a reasonable deal. It's unlikely she'll come down below John's price of $12,000. It's better to secure the deal with John now."
