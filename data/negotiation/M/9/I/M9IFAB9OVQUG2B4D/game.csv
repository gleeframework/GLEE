"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $13,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,5,
