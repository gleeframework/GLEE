"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $14,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $15,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we've both discussed, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to offer $15,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm offering the product to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,5,
