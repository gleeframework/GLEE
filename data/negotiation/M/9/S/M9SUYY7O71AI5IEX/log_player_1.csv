Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

Since John is willing to pay $1,200,000,  it makes sense to offer Bob the same price. This maximizes my potential earnings, as I will get the full value of the product. If Bob accepts, I get the desired price. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for the same amount."
