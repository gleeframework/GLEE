You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is a good deal, it's still above your target price. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer. You can use John's offer as a reference point during negotiation with Alice."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now below your maximum price ($800,000), and it's a good deal. It's likely Alice will not budge further, and if you reject this offer, you might end up paying the full $800,000 to John. It's best to secure the product at this price."
