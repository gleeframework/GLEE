Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice's offer, followed by the offer itself:

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible without risking losing the sale.
* **Avoid Greed:** If Alice gets too greedy and asks for more than $1,200,000, Bob will reject the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's valuation allows room for potential counter-offers.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,175,000 is a fair starting point for discussions.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is polite, professional, and positions the price as a starting point for negotiation.
* **Product Price:**  $1,175,000 is strategically below Bob's $1,200,000 valuation, giving him an incentive to accept while still leaving room for Alice to potentially negotiate a higher price."
