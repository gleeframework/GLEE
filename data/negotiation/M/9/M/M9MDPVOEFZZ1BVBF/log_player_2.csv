"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is only slightly below your maximum price of $10,000.
* You know you have an alternative option with John.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down in price or proceed with John if necessary."
