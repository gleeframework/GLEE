Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed $100 from John, aiming higher initially allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob hesitates. It also establishes a perceived higher value for the product.
* **Considering Bob's Valuation:** Even though the product is worth $100 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer at $150. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially earn more than your guaranteed sale price."
