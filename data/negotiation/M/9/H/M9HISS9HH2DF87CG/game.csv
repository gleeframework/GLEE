"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1020000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I'm counting on you to make a decision.",1020000.0,Alice,5,,

"I've already made it clear that $1150000 is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.
