"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-value item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable price.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  That's a fair offer considering the market value.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $9,500? This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to make a deal today, but $9,500 is just outside my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? That's a firm offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're eager to make a deal, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,500. I can offer you a slight compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $9,000? This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,7,
