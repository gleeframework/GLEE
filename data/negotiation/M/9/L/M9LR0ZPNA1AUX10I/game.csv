"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is still a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
