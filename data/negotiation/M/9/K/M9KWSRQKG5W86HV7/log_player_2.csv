Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $735000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and we're now only $10,000 apart. It's likely she won't go any lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal. Accepting her offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
