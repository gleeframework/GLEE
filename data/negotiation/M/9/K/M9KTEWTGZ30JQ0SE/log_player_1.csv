Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
