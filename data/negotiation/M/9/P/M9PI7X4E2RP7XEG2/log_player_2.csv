Round 7

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $915,000 is only $15,000 more than my last counteroffer of $910,000.  While I'd prefer a lower price, accepting this offer is still a good deal for me. It's within my budget and allows me to avoid further negotiation.  I'm also aware that I could purchase the product from John for $800,000, but the additional cost is minimal compared to the potential savings if Alice were to reject my counteroffer and we continued to negotiate."
