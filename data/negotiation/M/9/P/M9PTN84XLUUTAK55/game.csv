"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $10500. I'm thinking of making a counteroffer of $11800. What do you think?",11800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a new offer of $11200. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10800. This is a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $10800, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $11100. What do you think?",11100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to compromise.  While $11100 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $10950. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.  What do you think?",10950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $10950. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $11050. This is as close as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11050.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're close to a deal, but $11050 is still a bit above my target.  I'm willing to go up to $11000, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer.  Let's make this happen. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,10,
