Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However,  $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
