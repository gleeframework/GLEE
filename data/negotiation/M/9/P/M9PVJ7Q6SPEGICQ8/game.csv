"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As the owner, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $750,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $800,000 to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $750,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $700,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's true value to you. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something around $675,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $675,000. I can do $680,000. This is already a very competitive price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. What do you think?",680000.0,Alice,5,
