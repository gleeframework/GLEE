"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $105, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $98? It's a fair compromise and closer to what I can afford.",98.0,Bob,6,
