Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, I'll make an offer that's slightly higher than that. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 14000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is lower than the minimum value I'm willing to accept, so I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than $9,000 but lower than $14,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 12000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $9,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll also take into account that the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, so I'll aim for a price that's closer to that. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 11000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is still lower than the minimum value I'm willing to accept, so I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make another counteroffer that's higher than $10,500.
