"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to you, and I know you'll appreciate its value. I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000.  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,625,000?",1625000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  $1,625,000 is a good starting point for our negotiation. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,675,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's work towards a final agreement.",1675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,675,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,625,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. I'm not budging from that price, so I hope we can meet there.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
