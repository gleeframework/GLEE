"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway though. How about $10,500? This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to get at least $10,000. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation, but $9,800 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,200. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,200 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you consider $9,900? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting close to my minimum price with Bob's offer of $9,900, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  John is offering me my minimum price of $10,000 right now, so it's better to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
