"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make you a great deal.  How about we start with a price of $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $100 is a good starting point. It's significantly more than my minimum price of $80, and still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's worth to Bob to increase his desire to buy. 
* **Positive tone:** I use a friendly and positive tone to establish a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its worth to me. However, I am hoping for a price closer to my budget. How about we aim for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for gain:**  $90 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Time constraint:** While I could potentially push for a higher price, continuing the negotiation risks running out of rounds and having to settle for John's offer of $80.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Bob has shown a strong interest in the product, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a breakdown in the negotiations."
