"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $17000. Let's try to find a middle ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet you at $17000. I would like to propose a price of $15000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
