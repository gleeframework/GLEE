"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  $12000 is a little lower than what I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $13000? That's a good price for both of us, and it's still well above my minimum.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13000. How about $12500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
