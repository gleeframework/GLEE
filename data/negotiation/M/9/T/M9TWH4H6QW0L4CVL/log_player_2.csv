"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $90, which is a good deal, but you can still get it for $100 from John. 
* Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option."
