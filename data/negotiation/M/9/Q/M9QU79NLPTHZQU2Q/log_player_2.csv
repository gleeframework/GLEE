"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This would leave us both with a decent profit and be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's previous offer, aiming to push the negotiation closer to his desired price.
* **Justifying the offer:** Bob provides a reason for his price, highlighting the mutual benefit of a lower price.
* **Remaining within budget:** The offer is still within Bob's budget, ensuring he doesn't overspend."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the profit I'm willing to make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between their previous offers. 
* **Within budget:** The offer is still within Bob's budget, though it's not the ideal price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal to another buyer (John), while accepting the offer secures the product within a reasonable price range."
