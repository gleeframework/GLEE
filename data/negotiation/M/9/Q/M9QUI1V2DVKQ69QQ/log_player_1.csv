{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for your business.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than the $800,000 Bob values the product at. This gives him some room to negotiate but still leaves a significant profit margin for you.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:**  $1,200,000 is lower than your minimum of $1,500,000, meaning you have space to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's a strong starting point:** This offer shows you're confident in the value of your product and are open to negotiation, but you're not desperate for a sale."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  You have a better alternative with John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  This would still leave you with a significant profit margin, and it's a price I can work with."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to your target, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have a guaranteed alternative with John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if you can push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still not quite enough for me. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. How about we meet at $1,000,000?  This is a significant investment for you, but it would also allow me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm confident that this product will be incredibly valuable to your business."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really need to make sure this deal makes financial sense for my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still quite far from your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your desired price.  It's not worth risking a lower sale to continue negotiating with Bob, especially since he's already indicated he's at his limit."
