"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $20,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'm only able to offer $13,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $18,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still outside my price range. I'm prepared to offer $14,500. This is a significant step towards your asking price and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on it.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",17000.0,Alice,5,
