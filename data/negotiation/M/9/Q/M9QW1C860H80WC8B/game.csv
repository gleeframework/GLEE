That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $80. Let me know if you're willing to consider that.,80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can do $120 for the product. It's a fair price, considering its value to me is much higher than that.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $100, which is $110. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",110.0,Alice,5,
