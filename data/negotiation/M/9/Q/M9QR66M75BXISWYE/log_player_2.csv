Alice's offer is way too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $180 is already a steal for this item. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

While $140 is better than $180, it's still above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's final offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $120."
