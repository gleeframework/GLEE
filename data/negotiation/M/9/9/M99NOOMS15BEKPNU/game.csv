"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $950000 is a bit below my target.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $1000000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1050000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and dedicated support for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
