"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite steep. This product would be valuable to me, but  $2,300,000 is not within my budget. I could do something closer to $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I understand your perspective on its value. To find a middle ground, how about we consider $1,900,000?  This price reflects the true worth of this product and its potential to benefit your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  This reflects a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I need the price to be closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. Let me know if that works for you.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've given this offer careful consideration, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer you the product for $1,500,000.  This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair deal given the product's value.  Please let me know your decision.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
