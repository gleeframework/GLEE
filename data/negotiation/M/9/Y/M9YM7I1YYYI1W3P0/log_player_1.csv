"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm aiming high to provide room for negotiation and to gauge Bob's interest.  $2,300,000 is significantly more than his perceived value but not so outlandish that it might immediately scare him off.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the ""value and potential,"" I'm trying to frame the product in a way that might make Bob reconsider his $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and clearly states this is a ""starting point,"" inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation process.
 
**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price above my minimum ($1,500,000) that Bob is willing to pay. Starting high allows me to gather information about Bob's willingness to spend and adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite steep. This product would be valuable to me, but  $2,300,000 is not within my budget. I could do something closer to $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While his offer is low, it's a starting point.  His message suggests he's willing to negotiate. I need to determine how much higher he might go. 

**Strategy:**

In the next round, I'll propose a counteroffer significantly higher than his but lower than my initial offer, aiming to move the negotiation closer to a price point that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I understand your perspective on its value. To find a middle ground, how about we consider $1,900,000?  This price reflects the true worth of this product and its potential to benefit your business."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:** I've dropped my price by $400,000, demonstrating flexibility. However, $1,900,000 remains well above my $1,500,000 minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's potential benefits to Bob, hoping to nudge him closer to my desired price range.
* **Guaging His Willingness:** This counteroffer aims to understand how much Bob is genuinely willing to spend and how flexible he might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, $1,300,000 is still not acceptable.
* **Potential Upside:**  Bob's incremental increases suggest he might be willing to go higher, potentially even above my minimum. I need to test this.

**Strategy:**

I will reject this offer but make a smaller counteroffer, signaling I'm willing to negotiate in this price range if he's willing to move closer to my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  This reflects a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession, dropping $300,000, to demonstrate willingness to close the deal. 
* **Above Minimum, Enticing to Bob:** The $1,600,000 price point keeps me above my minimum while potentially being attractive enough for Bob to accept, as it's closer to his offer than my previous one.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By proposing a ""middle ground,"" I'm subtly creating a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision and potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I need the price to be closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not There:** Bob is very close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to risk one more round to try to secure that extra $100,000.
* **Time Constraint:**  I only have a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk Bob walking away entirely.  Rejecting now allows me to counter with a final offer.

**Strategy:**

In the next round, I will offer my absolute minimum price of $1,500,000. This makes it clear to Bob that this is my final offer, and he needs to decide if it's worth it for him."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've given this offer careful consideration, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer you the product for $1,500,000.  This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair deal given the product's value.  Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I've reached my absolute minimum price. This conveys seriousness and a sense of urgency to Bob.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is direct and leaves no room for misinterpretation. Bob understands this is my final offer.
* **Waiting for Response:** The ball is now in Bob's court. He needs to decide if the product is worth it to him at this price."
