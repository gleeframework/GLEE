"Bob, I have a very special product that I believe could be of immense value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe the potential return will be well worth it. Please consider this offer carefully. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1000000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
