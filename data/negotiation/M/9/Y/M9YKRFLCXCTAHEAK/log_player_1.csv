Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think it would be a great deal for you!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 is a strong starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($100) but leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Since you have John willing to pay $150, you're not desperate. This allows you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob.
* **Potential for Profit Maximization:**  If Bob accepts the $125 offer, you've made a tidy profit. If he rejects it, you can always fall back on selling to John at your minimum acceptable price."
