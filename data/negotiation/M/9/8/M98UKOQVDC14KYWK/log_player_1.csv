Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** Offering it at a price closer to Bob's maximum value increases the chance he'll accept, avoiding the need to sell it to John for less. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
