"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm confident the product's value to you justifies a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still outside of my ideal range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. Your offer of $1,250,000 is closer to where I need to be. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.  This price still reflects the unique value this product offers, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
