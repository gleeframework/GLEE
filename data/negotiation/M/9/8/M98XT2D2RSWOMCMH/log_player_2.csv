Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. My initial offer is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, and you have 10 rounds to try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offering process and potentially save more money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm confident the product's value to you justifies a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high.  You're still within your budget, and there are more rounds to negotiate. By rejecting the offer, you can continue to push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still outside of my ideal range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a slight increase from your previous proposal but keeps the price below $1,300,000. You're demonstrating flexibility while still trying to get the best possible price. It also highlights the value you see in the product to justify your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. Your offer of $1,250,000 is closer to where I need to be. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.  This price still reflects the unique value this product offers, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  You have 5 rounds left, so rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to try and get a lower price. You can offer a slightly higher counteroffer to show your willingness to compromise, but still aim for a price closer to your goal."
