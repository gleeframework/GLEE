"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $1,000,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully.  If you're not interested, I have a backup buyer ready to purchase it at the same price.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to establish a sense of urgency and scarcity by mentioning a backup buyer.  While she might have someone else interested, there's no reason to believe you can't negotiate a better price.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, so you don't lose anything by rejecting Alice's initial offer and seeing if she'll come down in price."
