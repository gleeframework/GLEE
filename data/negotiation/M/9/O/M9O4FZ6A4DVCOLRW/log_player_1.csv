Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I want to make the sale, I'm still confident I can get a slightly higher price.  I'll try one more counteroffer."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, he's not budging on his offer, and I'm worried the negotiation will continue indefinitely. I'm confident I can get a better price than $8,000 in the future, but John is a guaranteed sale right now."
