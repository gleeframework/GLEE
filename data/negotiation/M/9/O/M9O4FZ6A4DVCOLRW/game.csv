"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? It's still a great price for you, and I'd be happy to sell it to you at that price. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $9,800 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000. That's a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal!",10000.0,Alice,5,
