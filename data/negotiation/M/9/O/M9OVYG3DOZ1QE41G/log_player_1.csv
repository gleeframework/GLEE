I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, and I want to see if Bob is truly interested and what his perceived value is."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but it's still a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm going to reject this offer and make a counteroffer. I believe I can still get a better price than $1,200,000."

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I hope this will encourage Bob to accept, but if not, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
