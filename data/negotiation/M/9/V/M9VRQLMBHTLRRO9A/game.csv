"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I value your interest, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $11,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both parties.",11500.0,Alice,3,
