Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to build rapport and emphasize the value of the product.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm framing the offer as a question to encourage Bob to engage in a conversation. 

This strategy aims to secure a higher price while also maintaining a good relationship with Bob, in case further negotiations are needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $100. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is simply too low.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.  Selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed profit, but I'm not ready to give up on a better deal with Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a great product, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $110 to $90, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to reconsider his offer.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation amicable. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a great product Alice, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable value than Bob's previous offer, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I've already gone down to $90 from my initial asking price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation that might lead to an even lower price.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
