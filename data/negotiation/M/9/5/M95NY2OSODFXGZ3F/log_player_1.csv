Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale. I'm asking for $150 for it. I'm sure you'll find it to be a great value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $150, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Positive Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates that I am open to negotiating the price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll wait for Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his counteroffers. 
* If the negotiations stall or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll move to selling to John for the guaranteed $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'm interested in selling the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues it.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. This will hopefully encourage further negotiation and lead to a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, considering your interest in the product. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Firm Price:** I'm countering with $130, which is still above my minimum but a significant drop from my initial offer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Positive Tone:** My message remains positive and focuses on finding a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Open to Compromise:**  I reiterate my openness to compromise, encouraging further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects this offer, I may need to consider selling to John for $120, as I'm unwilling to go much lower than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $80 might be a bit too low, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we meet at $110? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Since Bob has indicated this is his highest offer, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of him walking away.  This ensures I receive a price that's close to my minimum, and I'll be able to move on to other opportunities."
