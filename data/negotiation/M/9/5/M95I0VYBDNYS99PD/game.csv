"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget.  I'd like to offer $950,000 for it.  This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget, and I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm prepared to offer $975,000, which is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget constraints.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,012,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product and meet me in the middle. What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,012,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $990,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and our respective needs. I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,
