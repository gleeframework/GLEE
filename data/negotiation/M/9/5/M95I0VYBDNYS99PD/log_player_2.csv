"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for negotiation.**  You're looking to save as much as possible, and a starting price of $1,100,000 is a good point to begin negotiations.
* **Buying from John is too expensive.**  You're looking to save money, and John's price is above your target.
* **Rejecting and counteroffering allows for more potential savings.**  By rejecting, you can signal your interest in the product while setting the stage for a more favorable price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget.  I'd like to offer $950,000 for it.  This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unrealistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's original offer but still leaves room for compromise.  It shows that you're serious about saving money.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  The message highlights the potential for a win-win situation, making it more likely for Alice to consider your offer.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget, and I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000.

I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,012,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $990,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your target price.**  While the offer is still a bit above your desired price range, you've made significant progress in the negotiation.
* **The risk of further negotiation is high.**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, but she's also signaled that this is her final offer.  Continuing the negotiation could risk losing the deal entirely.
