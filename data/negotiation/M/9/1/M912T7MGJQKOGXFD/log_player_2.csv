"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $950,000, which is a generous offer considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Since the product is worth $800,000 to her, there's definitely room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $920,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my target price.  While it's closer to my desired price, I can likely get it lower by continuing to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $885,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to think about the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me consider it... Alright, I'll make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $900,000 is still above my ideal price, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer and getting closer to my target. Considering that:

*  Buying from John would cost me $1,000,000, and 
* Alice has stated this is her final offer, 

Accepting her offer is the most advantageous choice. It saves me $100,000 compared to buying from John and allows me to secure the product within my budget."
