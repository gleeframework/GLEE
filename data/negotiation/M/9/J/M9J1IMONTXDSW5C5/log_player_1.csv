I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit significantly above my minimum value."

Bob's offer is my minimum price, but I believe I can still get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer. I'm hoping it's appealing enough to encourage him to come up a bit."

Bob is unwilling to budge from his minimum price, and I've already made concessions.  To avoid risking further negotiation and potentially losing more time, I'll sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
