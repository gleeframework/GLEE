Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it provides significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and increases your potential profit.
* **Testing the Waters:**  The $19,000 offer is a starting point to gauge Bob's interest. His reaction will give you insight into how much he values the product and how high he might be willing to go.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies a willingness to negotiate by mentioning you're ""open to hearing your thoughts."" This encourages Bob to engage in the conversation. 

**Important Note:**  While you want to maximize profit, it's crucial to find a balance. If your initial offer is too high, Bob might walk away without countering, and you'll miss the opportunity to make a sale above your guaranteed price."
