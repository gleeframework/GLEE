Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $17,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $14,500? I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my ideal price, it's still close to the minimum I'm willing to accept.  However, I believe I can potentially get closer to my asking price of $17,000 by counter-offering.  I'll aim for a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $15,750.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $15,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $15,250?  I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the sale to John for $15,000 is too high.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale and minimizes potential losses."
