"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $14,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is quite a bit below what I'm aiming for. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

``` 

While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob should still reject.  He's very close to his maximum price with John, and should continue to negotiate to get a better deal."
