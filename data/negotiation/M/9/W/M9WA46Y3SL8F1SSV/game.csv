"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,250. This is a fair price, and I'm confident that we can close the deal. What do you say?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but $8,250 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,375. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate. Let me know what you think.",8375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $8,375 is still a bit too high, but I'm willing to go up to $8,125. This is my final offer. Let me know if we can close this deal.",8125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,125 is close, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $8,200. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",8200.0,Alice,7,
