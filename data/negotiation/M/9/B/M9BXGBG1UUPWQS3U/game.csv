"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $105 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to do $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit too high for you. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $102. It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",102.0,Alice,5,
