"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $10000 for it. This is a special offer tailored to ensure you get the best deal possible while still allowing me to fairly compensate for the product's worth. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially get closer to his desired price point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure that the transaction remains beneficial for both parties. Therefore, I propose a price of $9000 for the product. This price allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while acknowledging your budget constraints. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum price point of $8,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get Alice to come down even further in price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go up to $8,750.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience and flexibility, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. After careful consideration, I am prepared to accept a price of $8900 for the product. This price ensures a fair return for me while remaining within your budget constraints. I believe this is the best outcome for both parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $8,900 is very close to his budget, it's still above his maximum price point of $8,000.  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower counteroffer.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum budget, allowing him to save the extra $900."
