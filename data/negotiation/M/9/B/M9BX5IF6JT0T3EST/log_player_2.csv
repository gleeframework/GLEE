"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's room for a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing my value for the product. However, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is still a good profit for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll keep the deal moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still in a good position to negotiate further. While $9,250 is a decent price, there's still room to get closer to your goal of $9,000.  Let's see if you can convince Alice to come down a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,250 is closer, but I'm still stuck at $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
