Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, starting high gives us room to negotiate and still achieve a price higher than our guaranteed sale to John ($120).
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering the product at $110, we signal some willingness to negotiate, which Bob might appreciate. 
* **Staying above our minimum:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $110 still earns us a profit over our guaranteed price from John. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while ensuring a sale."
