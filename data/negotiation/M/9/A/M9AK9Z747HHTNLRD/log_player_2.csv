"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Offering $900,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is only $25,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer. This is a good price for Bob, considering he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  There's no guarantee Alice will continue to lower the price, and it's likely that future counteroffers will be closer to $950,000.  Accepting the offer now secures a good deal with minimal risk."
