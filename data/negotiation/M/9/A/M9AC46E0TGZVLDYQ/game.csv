"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to buy it from you for $100.  Let me know what you think!",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $137.50.  Let's make this deal happen!",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $137.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $125, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move on!",125.0,Alice,5,
