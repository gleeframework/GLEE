Round 2

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway between $90 and $110, so how about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $80.  While Alice is coming down in price, she's still above Bob's maximum of $80. He's run out of time to negotiate with her, and buying from John is the best option to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
