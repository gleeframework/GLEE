"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I've given it a lot of thought, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000.  I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still leaves Alice with a profit.  There's a good chance that further negotiation will only lead to more back and forth without a substantial price drop.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
