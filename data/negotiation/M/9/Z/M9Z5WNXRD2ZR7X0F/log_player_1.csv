"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $80 is too low for me.  Could you do $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, but $130 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Explanation: Bob is unwilling to budge beyond his perceived value of the product ($100). Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $150, it makes no financial sense to continue negotiating with Bob."
