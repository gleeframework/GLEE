"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring you significant returns. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me starting out. Could we do $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from anchoring a lower price early. This gives us room to move upward while still staying well below our $1,500,000 maximum.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer but clearly states our position without being overly aggressive.
* **Leaving Room:** A $300,000 difference is substantial. It allows for counter-offers from Alice and gives us flexibility to adjust our price if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,300,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is coming down, but she's still aiming for a price above her own valuation.  We have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest,  $1,100,000 is where I see the value of this product right now.  If you're willing to work in that range, I think we can get a deal done."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counter-offer lands almost directly in the middle of our previous offer ($900,000) and her current one ($1,300,000). This signals willingness to compromise but holds firm on our overall budget.
* **Direct & Transparent:** We're being upfront about our valuation of the product. This helps build trust and potentially moves the negotiation along more efficiently. 
* **Time Pressure (Implicit):** We're getting closer to John's backup price. While we don't explicitly mention it, Alice might sense urgency on our end, encouraging a quicker resolution."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $1,200,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is at her limit:** She's explicitly stated this is her lowest price and reiterated it's her minimum.  
* **We're close to John's price:** Further haggling risks pushing Alice away and forcing us to buy from John at $1,500,000. 
* **A good deal:** $1,200,000 is a significant savings from our maximum and a reasonable compromise."
