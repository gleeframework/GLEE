"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think it's a great product, but I have to consider my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $11,500? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,500 as my final offer.  This product will really benefit you, and I want to make this deal happen.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm afraid $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $11,500, so I'm offering $12,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",12000.0,Bob,6,
