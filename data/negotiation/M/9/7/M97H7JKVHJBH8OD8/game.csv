"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I can do $11,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're not willing to go as low as $10,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate the suggestion, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I can do $11,250, but that's as close to $11,000 as I'm willing to get. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $11,100.  Let me know what you think.",11100.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,7,
