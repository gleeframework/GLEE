# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to consider other options.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated ""$11,500 is my final offer.""  She's unlikely to go lower.  While you could try negotiating further, you're running the risk of her sticking to her price, leaving you with a worse outcome than buying from John for $15,000.  It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice."
