Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I want to reach a deal.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $1,350,000.  This price is fair and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?

Alice is clearly motivated to sell and is making concessions. While we could push for a slightly lower price, the difference at this point is likely to be small. Accepting the $1,350,000 offer secures the product at a significant saving compared to John's offer."
