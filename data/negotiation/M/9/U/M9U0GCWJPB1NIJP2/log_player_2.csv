{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, considering its potential benefits to my business. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise given the potential it holds for your business. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.
