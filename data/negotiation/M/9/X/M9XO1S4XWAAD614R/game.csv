"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you, while also recognizing your willingness to negotiate. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $900000. I'd be willing to go up to $875000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $925000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.
