"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
