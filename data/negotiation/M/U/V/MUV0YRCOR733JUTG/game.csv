"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're the only ones with access to this product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,000,000? That's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price. If you're willing to meet me here, I'm ready to finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
