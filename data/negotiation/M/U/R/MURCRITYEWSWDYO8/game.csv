"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to consider $8000? ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8500.  If that's not acceptable, we may need to part ways.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8500 is a bit higher than your original offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8700. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",8700.0,Alice,5,
