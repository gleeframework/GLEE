Round 7
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has consistently rejected offers at or below my $10,000 maximum. She seems unlikely to budge much further, and I'm not willing to risk going over budget. Buying from John guarantees I get the product at my maximum price."
