"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  This product would be very useful to me, but I need to make sure it fits my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,000. I believe that's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair deal. How about we try $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your number. How about we settle on $10,000? That's the absolute maximum I can offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me in the middle. How about we try $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,7,
