"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget, Bob, but $12,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $13,500?  That's a fair compromise, reflecting the value this product brings.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle at $13,000? That's the highest I can go without going over my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
