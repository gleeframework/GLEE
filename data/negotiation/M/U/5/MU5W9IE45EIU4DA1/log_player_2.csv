"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob's maximum willingness to pay is $1,000,000. Alice is willing to sell for $800,000. This means there's a significant gap where they could both benefit from a lower price.
* **Negotiation leverage:** Rejecting the offer puts the pressure on Alice. She now knows Bob is willing to walk away, making her more likely to negotiate.

By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer closer to his desired price point and hopefully secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  Bob should continue to negotiate, as there's still room for a better deal.  

By rejecting, Bob maintains pressure on Alice and keeps the option of buying from John open if the negotiations fail."
