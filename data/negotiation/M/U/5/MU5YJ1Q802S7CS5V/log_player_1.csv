{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my value ($12,000), but it leaves room for negotiation. By offering a slightly lower price than my minimum, I show I'm willing to compromise while still maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for less than $11,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price by countering Bob's offer."

Bob's offer is still too low for me. I'm not willing to go lower than $11,000, and it seems like we're at a stalemate.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, selling to John for $12,000 is the best option to ensure I meet my minimum goal."
