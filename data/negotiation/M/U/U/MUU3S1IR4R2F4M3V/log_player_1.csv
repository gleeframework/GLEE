Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you value it at $15,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000,  and it leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value proposition for Bob.  I highlight the potential benefit for him while also leaving space for a counter-offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a win-win situation. 
* I'm starting high, but not too high, to leave room for negotiation. 
* I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
