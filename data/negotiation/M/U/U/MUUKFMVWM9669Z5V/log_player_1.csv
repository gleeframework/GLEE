Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $100."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you'd be willing to sell to John for $100, there's a chance to get more from Bob. 
* **Strong Starting Point:** Offering the product at your minimum acceptable price ($100) sets a strong anchor. Bob may not be willing to pay this, but it gives you room to negotiate down slightly if needed.
* **Sense of Exclusivity:** By framing the offer as a pre-public sale opportunity, you add a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to get the highest possible price. However, be prepared for Bob to reject the offer. If he does, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your desired minimum."
