"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential, I'm starting the bidding at $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for an item of this caliber. ",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is way above what I'm willing to pay. I understand the value of the product, but $2,250,000 is simply too steep.  Let's start with a more realistic price point. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for it.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer. While $1,750,000 is a significant sum, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but need to stay above the $2 million mark. How about we settle on $2,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,750,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,950,000? This represents a significant move on my end, and I believe it reflects the value you're gaining from this unique product.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,950,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. ",1850000.0,Bob,6,
