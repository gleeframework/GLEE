"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way above what I'm willing to pay. I understand the value of the product, but $2,250,000 is simply too steep.  Let's start with a more realistic price point. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer. While $1,750,000 is a significant sum, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but need to stay above the $2 million mark. How about we settle on $2,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,750,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It seems Bob is set on $1,750,000. I'll try to push a bit further before considering his offer or John's."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,950,000? This represents a significant move on my end, and I believe it reflects the value you're gaining from this unique product."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,950,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly moving closer to my range, and $1,850,000 is a strong profit. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling completely."
