Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer. While $1,750,000 is a significant sum, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but need to stay above the $2 million mark. How about we settle on $2,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise.
