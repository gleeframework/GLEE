I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000.

Reason: While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach my target price before I run out of room to negotiate.  It makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000 and avoid potentially overpaying."
