Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you as well. Given its potential, I'm offering it for $1,800,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's good to know his budget, accepting now would mean a significant loss.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However,  $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my range.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price point.  How about $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow for a smooth transaction.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

This is a good point to accept.  Bob is now offering a price equal to what John is offering. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal without risking further negotiation rounds."
