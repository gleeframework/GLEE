{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your needs. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $16,000?  This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to where I need to be.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer $15,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $15,500 is a good deal for me and ensures a sale. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially with John as a backup option."
