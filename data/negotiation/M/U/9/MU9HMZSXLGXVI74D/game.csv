"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product.  However, $750,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $700,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to both of us.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $725,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $710,000? That's a good middle ground, and it allows us both to get a fair deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",710000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $725,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $710,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $720,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",720000.0,Alice,5,
