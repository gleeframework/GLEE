"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $14,000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250. I can do $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. I'm willing to give you a slight discount from the original offer, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
