"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation, so it makes sense to reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway, offering a price that is significantly lower than her initial offer but still above his maximum budget. This shows he is serious about buying the product but is also trying to save money. This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to negotiate further while also giving Bob a chance to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $10,500 is still outside Bob's budget. He is determined to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,000.  It's a fair price for the value of the product, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to sell it quickly."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous offer of $9,000. He's trying to show Alice that he's serious about this price, and he's willing to hold his ground. By reaffirming his previous offer and highlighting the benefits for Alice, Bob is trying to nudge Alice closer to his desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible. While Alice has lowered her price to $10,000, it is still above Bob's maximum budget. He has 5 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this. While $10,000 is getting closer to what I can afford, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm going to offer $9,500. This is a good deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for the product and allows me to purchase it within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push with a counteroffer of $9,500. He's met Alice halfway again, hoping to find a compromise. This offer demonstrates his commitment to the deal while still trying to stay within his budget. It's a strong middle ground that should encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is still a bit lower than my initial offer, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,750. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly from her original price, $9,750 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. He has only 3 rounds left, and the negotiations are becoming increasingly challenging.  It is now more advantageous for Bob to stop the negotiation with Alice and purchase the product from John for $8,000. This ensures he gets the product at the best possible price within his budget."
