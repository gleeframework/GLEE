{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than my minimum value of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $9,000 is a good price, significantly higher than John's offer, and getting closer to my initial asking price. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
