Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your initial proposal.  However, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering the value it holds for me and still gives you a solid profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
