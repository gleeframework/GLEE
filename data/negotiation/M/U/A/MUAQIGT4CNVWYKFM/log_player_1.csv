Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice knows its worth much more to her and that John will pay $1,500,000.  Starting high leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message doesn't just throw out a number; it emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to subtly nudge Bob's perceived value higher.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone is polite and invites Bob's response, encouraging negotiation rather than an immediate rejection. 

**Strategy:**

Alice is aiming high, hoping Bob might value some unstated aspect of the product enough to pay above his initial valuation. If Bob negotiates down, Alice has room to maneuver before hitting her minimum price ($1,500,000).  If Bob rejects the offer outright, Alice has her guaranteed sale to John."
