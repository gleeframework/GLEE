Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with my desired price of $1,200,000. It's a bold move, but I'm confident in the value of my product.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm coming down to $1,100,000.  This is a substantial compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me a good profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price, as it's still a good deal for him.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, $950,000 is still too low. I'm going to make another counteroffer, but if we can't reach a deal soon, I'll need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This negotiation has gone on long enough.  Bob's offers are still too far below my minimum acceptable price, and it's clear we're not going to agree.  I'm going to take the safe route and sell to John.  While I'd prefer to sell for more, it's better to secure a guaranteed profit than to risk getting stuck in a never-ending negotiation with Bob."
