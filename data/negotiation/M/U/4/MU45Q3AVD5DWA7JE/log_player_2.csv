"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It's in your best interest to negotiate and see if you can get a price closer to your $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **It's polite and acknowledges Alice's offer.** 
* **It firmly states that the initial price is unacceptable.** This sets the tone for negotiation.
* **It offers a significantly lower price, but still above your absolute limit.** This gives you room to negotiate further while signaling your interest."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice came down in price, but $12,000 is still significantly higher than both your target price and what John offers. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,000 is still more than I had in mind. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

Here's why this counter-offer makes sense:

* **It acknowledges Alice's compromise but reiterates your budget constraints.**  This keeps the negotiation moving while reminding Alice that you have limits.
* **It offers a price closer to the middle ground.** This shows a willingness to negotiate, but you're still aiming for a price well below Alice's desired selling point. 
* **It maintains some flexibility for future negotiation.** There's still some space between your $10,000 offer and your $8,000 fallback option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly further.  While you could try to negotiate a bit more, $11,500 is still a long way from your ideal price and significantly more than John's $8,000 offer. It's time to walk away and take the guaranteed deal with John."
