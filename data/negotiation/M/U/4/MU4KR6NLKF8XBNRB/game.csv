"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, I'm still finding it a bit pricey. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
