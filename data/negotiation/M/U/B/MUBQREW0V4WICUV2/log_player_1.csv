Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,400,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $1,400,000 is still lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,500,000).
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still go up a bit if Bob counteroffers, and you have room to negotiate down if you need to.

This approach aims to maximize your earnings while also leaving room for negotiation to achieve a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. I am willing to pay $1,350,000 for your product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below your ideal price.  You have room to negotiate further with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and try to secure a price closer to your desired $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,375,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing you're willing to negotiate while also holding onto a good amount of profit.
* **Still within Bob's range:**  $1,375,000 is still lower than what the product is worth to Bob.
* **Leaving room for a final negotiation:** You're still open to a bit of negotiation, but this puts you in a strong position to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I still believe we can find a better solution. I am willing to pay $1,360,000 for your product. I hope this revised offer will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:**  $1,360,000 is very close to your original offer of $1,375,000.
* **Higher than John's offer:** This offer is significantly higher than what John is willing to pay.
* **Minimizing risk:**  It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower offer or a stalled negotiation, potentially forcing you to accept John's offer.

By accepting this offer, you secure a strong price while minimizing the risk of further negotiations."
