"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a good price, it's still above Bob's $100 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $100. Would you be willing to consider $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the realm of possibility for both parties. This sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation.  While Alice might be unwilling to go down to $95 immediately, this counteroffer will likely make her reconsider her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're on a budget, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $105 is tempting, Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. He can potentially get the product for $100 from John, so there's still room for negotiation with Alice. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob another chance to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $105 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $102.50. This is a fair price considering my budget, and it's closer to your last offer."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save money, but recognizes he needs to meet Alice halfway. Offering $102.50 shows he's serious about making a deal, but still pushing for a lower price. This counteroffer is a good compromise that can potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $108? It's a bit above your last offer, but I'm getting closer to your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. He can get the product for $100 from John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to try and get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  I'm still hoping we can find a price that's a bit closer to my budget.  How about $104?  It's a small difference from your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 104}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his target price of $100. He's making a small counteroffer to show his willingness to make a deal, while still trying to save a few more dollars. Offering $104 demonstrates that he's serious about getting this product from Alice, but he's not willing to give up too much. This small difference could be the final push to secure a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob! I think we're getting close. How about we meet at $109? It's a small step back from my last offer, but I'm trying to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $109 is still higher than Bob's target price of $100.  With only a few rounds left, the chances of getting a lower price from Alice are slim. Bob has already made several counteroffers and Alice has consistently rejected them, indicating she's unwilling to go much lower.  At this point, it's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John for $100, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiations with Alice."
