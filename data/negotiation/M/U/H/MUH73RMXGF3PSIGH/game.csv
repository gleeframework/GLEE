"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, your initial price is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to consider a purchase price of $800,000, which reflects the maximum value I'm able to offer.  I believe this is a fair price given the market and my specific needs.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential ROI for your business. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects a substantial discount while still recognizing the true worth of what I'm offering.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still too high for my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This represents a substantial investment on my part and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product.  I hope we can reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
