"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point as it's a fair compromise between my minimum price and the value Bob places on the product. I believe this will encourage Bob to accept the offer, but also leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more favorable price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is still attractive to Bob, but also allows for further negotiation if he wants to counter again."
