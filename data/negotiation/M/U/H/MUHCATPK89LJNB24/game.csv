"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000, but I'm not going any lower. Let's see if we can meet at this price point.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $13,000, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'll meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price point.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a good deal, and I appreciate you coming down to $14,000.  However, I'm still not quite there.  My final offer is $13,500.  This is the most I can afford, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already met you at $14,000, and now you're asking me to go even lower to $13,500? I'm not willing to go that low, Bob. I'll make one more concession, but I need to get at least $14,500 for this deal to be worth it. Let's see if we can meet at this price point.",14500.0,Alice,7,
