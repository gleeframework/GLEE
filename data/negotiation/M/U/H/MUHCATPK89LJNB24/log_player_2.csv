"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product for a competitive price. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is far above his maximum budget, and it's better to see if he can get a better deal with Alice or go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000, but I'm not going any lower. Let's see if we can meet at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $15,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better price. He can either try to negotiate further with Alice or buy from John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $13,000, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'll meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's getting closer to his budget, but it's still above his desired price point.  He can either try to negotiate further with Alice or buy from John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a good deal, and I appreciate you coming down to $14,000.  However, I'm still not quite there.  My final offer is $13,500.  This is the most I can afford, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already met you at $14,000, and now you're asking me to go even lower to $13,500? I'm not willing to go that low, Bob. I'll make one more concession, but I need to get at least $14,500 for this deal to be worth it. Let's see if we can meet at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  He's already been through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to a price that's acceptable to him.  At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 deal from John rather than risk further negotiations with Alice."
