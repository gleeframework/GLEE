"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a significant drop from my initial price. This product holds immense value, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a great opportunity.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
