Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still feel that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,150,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

We're still significantly above John's offer. Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and we're getting closer to a price point that could be mutually beneficial."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,175,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could continue negotiating, Bob has introduced the phrase ""final offer."" It's likely pushing further will be unproductive and could risk him walking away. Accepting $1,125,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of having to settle for John's offer."
