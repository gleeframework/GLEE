{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is more than Bob's initial assessment of the product's worth, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be at least at $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe you'll find it's worth the investment. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $12,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,750 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better price. I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John, as I'm getting closer to the end of the rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, and I can offer the product for $13,500.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but $13,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this one last offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,800 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. However, we are getting very close to the end of the rounds, and I am starting to run out of time. I'm hoping to get one more counteroffer from Bob to see if he'll come up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,800 is still not quite where I need to be.  Considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,150.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will be a good investment for you. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but $13,150 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,900, but that's as high as I can go. I'm getting close to walking away from the deal and buying from John. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my desired price point. While $12,900 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  John is willing to pay my full asking price, so I'm going to sell to him and avoid any further risk of losing out on a better deal."
