"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,000 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I had in mind. Could you consider $7,000? That would be a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great price for a product worth $12,000 to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I think we're getting close, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that.",8000.0,Alice,7,
