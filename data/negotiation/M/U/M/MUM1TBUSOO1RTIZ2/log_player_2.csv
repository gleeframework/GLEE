"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I know I can get the product for a better price, either from Alice with some negotiation or from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to move on the price. This gives us room to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down in price, $9,000 is still too high considering her initial offer and the product's value to her. I'll continue negotiating to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I had in mind. Could you consider $7,000? That would be a fair price."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  Let's see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great price for a product worth $12,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Her statement about the product being worth $12,000 to me doesn't hold much weight since I have the option to buy from John at that price.  I'll counter-offer one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

I'm sticking to my guns and increasing my offer slightly again. This keeps me in the negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly below Alice's last offer.  It's important to remain firm but fair in this stage of the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I think we're getting close, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal! Alice has reached her minimum price, and it's a significant saving compared to buying from John. It's time to accept and finalize the purchase."
