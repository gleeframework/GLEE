"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $10000? I'm ready to buy it today if we can agree on that price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $12500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11000, which is a significant step from my initial offer.  I hope you'll consider this a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you at $12200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $12200 is still beyond my budget.  I'm going to have to stick with my offer of $11000.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close this deal today. ",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $11000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you at $11800. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $11800 is still too high.  I'm willing to go to $11500, which is a significant step from my previous offer.  We're close, I hope we can come to an agreement. ",11500.0,Bob,8,
