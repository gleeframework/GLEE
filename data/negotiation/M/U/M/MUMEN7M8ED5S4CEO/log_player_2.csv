"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's initial offer is above his maximum budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I'm ready to buy it today if we can agree on that price."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $12500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since there are multiple rounds left. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant step from my initial offer.  I hope you'll consider this a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you at $12200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, but her offer of $12,200 is still above Bob's ideal price.  Bob should continue negotiating in hopes of getting closer to his target of $10,000. There are still several rounds left, and a little more pressure might push Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $12,200 is still beyond my budget.  I'm going to have to stick with my offer of $11,000.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close this deal today. "", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $11000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you at $11800. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but $11,800 is still above Bob's target. There are only a few rounds left, and Bob has a guaranteed backup option with John. It's worth pushing to see if Alice will lower the price further. Even if she doesn't, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,800 is still too high.  I'm willing to go to $11,500, which is a significant step from my previous offer.  We're close, I hope we can come to an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $11700. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round. Even though Alice has made a slight concession, her final offer of $11,700 is still higher than Bob's target price of $10,000. There is no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a better price, and Bob risks losing the opportunity to buy the product entirely if he rejects Alice's offer. 

Since Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000, it's the most logical decision to buy from John and save $1,700."
