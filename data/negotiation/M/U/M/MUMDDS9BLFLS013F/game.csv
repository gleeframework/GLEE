"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this. While I see the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to go to $1,000,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to go down to $1,020,000, which is still a great deal for you, but also takes into account my initial asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
