"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $12000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be happy to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $10500. This is a fair price considering we're both trying to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $10500. I can meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11250. This is my final compromise.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11000? This feels like a fair price considering both of our needs. Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck in a loop, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer the product to you for $11375. This is my last offer before I start considering other options.",11375.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I want to make sure we find a solution that works for both of us. While $11375 is still a bit above my budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. I'm offering $11125 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering our discussions.  If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I'll have to explore other options. ",11125.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the end of the road. I'm willing to make one final offer, but I need to make sure it's a price that I'm comfortable with. I can offer the product to you for $11500. This is my absolute final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",11500.0,Alice,9,
