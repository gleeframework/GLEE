"Round 1

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $10,000? I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to consider my own minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11500. Can you meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible.  While $11,500 is better than the initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target.  He has more rounds to negotiate and can likely get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiations going."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still trying to stay within my budget, and $11,500 is a little too high for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm confident this price works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking $12500 is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is closer to Bob's target than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than what he wants to pay.  Bob is also aware that he has 5 more rounds to negotiate, giving him more opportunities to try and secure a better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, allowing Bob to continue trying to lower the price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still too high for me.  Let's try $11,250. That's a fair compromise and closer to where I need to be. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I still need to get a bit more. I'm willing to meet you at $13000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's target than previous offers, it is still too high. He's still within his budget and has 3 more rounds to negotiate. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to try and get a lower price. The goal is to find a price that is mutually agreeable to both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. That's a good price for me, and it's still a good profit for you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than my last offer, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'll meet you at $12500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's the best price we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation.  Bob is only one round away from having to buy from John at $15,000.  While $12,500 is higher than Bob's ideal price, it is still a significant saving compared to John's price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a lower price than John's, and it's likely that Alice will not go any lower."
