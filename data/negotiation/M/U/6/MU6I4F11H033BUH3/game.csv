"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a price closer to what the product is worth.  Let's split the difference.  I'm happy to sell it to you for $1,025,000.  This allows me to make a fair profit while still offering you a competitive deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $985,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a good profit while still allowing me to acquire the product within my budget. What do you say?",985000.0,Bob,4,
