Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,100,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a price closer to what the product is worth.  Let's split the difference.  I'm happy to sell it to you for $1,025,000.  This allows me to make a fair profit while still offering you a competitive deal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can try to negotiate further and see if he can get Alice to come down even more."
