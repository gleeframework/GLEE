Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches John's offer. Since my minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000, it makes sense to sell to John immediately. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a higher price, and it introduces unnecessary risk and time delay."
