"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still significantly lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Value Emphasis:** I highlight the product's value to make it more appealing. 

I'm aiming for a quick agreement in the early rounds. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the subsequent rounds based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even my initial offer of $12,000.  Accepting his offer would leave me with a significant loss.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or, in the worst-case scenario, sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's find a middle ground.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price from $12,000 to $10,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Value:** I reiterate that the price is still a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Open Invitation:** The message ends with a question, encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

This counteroffer is a step in the right direction,  I'm hoping Bob will come closer to my ideal price. If he rejects again, I'll further adjust my offer in subsequent rounds, keeping the possibility of selling to John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $10000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but I'm only able to go up to $9000. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $9,000 is still a significant loss for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get a better price, but I won't settle for anything drastically below my minimum.  The threat of selling to John for $15,000 gives me leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good outcome. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the importance of finding a solution and closing the deal.
* **Positive Outcome:**  I frame the $9,500 price as a win-win for both of us.

This counteroffer is a strong attempt to reach an agreement. If Bob rejects, I'll continue to negotiate, but I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John for $15,000 becomes a more attractive option."
