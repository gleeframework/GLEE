"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's find a middle ground.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $10000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but I'm only able to go up to $9000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good outcome. Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
