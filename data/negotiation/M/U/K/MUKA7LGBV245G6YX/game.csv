"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and $9,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me stay within my budget. Please consider my offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is the lowest price I can offer. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
