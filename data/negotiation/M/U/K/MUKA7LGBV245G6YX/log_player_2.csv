"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice or move on to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and $9,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he wants to spend.  He can get the same product from John for $8,000, so it makes sense to counteroffer again or buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me stay within my budget. Please consider my offer."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is the lowest price I can offer. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's final offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's budget. He's already made several counteroffers, and it seems unlikely that Alice will go lower. Given the option to buy the same product from John for $8,000, it's the best decision for Bob to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
