"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise again, but I think $110 is the lowest I can go. It's still a good price for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",110.0,Alice,5,
