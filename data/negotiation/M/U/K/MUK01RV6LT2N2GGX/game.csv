"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is unique, I'm on a tight budget. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to accept $975,000 yet. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I believe it's worth considering. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. To be completely honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute highest I'm willing to go. If you can do that, we have a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your absolute limit, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer.
