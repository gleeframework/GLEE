"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to make a deal, but  $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant reduction, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $900,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still looking for a bit more of a discount.  I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a bit more of a discount, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $890,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",890000.0,Alice,5,
