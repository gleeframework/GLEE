Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer. Bob incrementally increasing his offer suggests he's willing to pay more than his initial offer. Let's see if we can push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position. I'm willing to come down slightly further. How about $1,300,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're getting closer to Bob's offer, but by stating this is our final offer, we're creating a sense of urgency and signaling that we're firm on our valuation. This might push Bob to accept or make a more significant counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has hit his maximum price and is unlikely to go any higher. It's time to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed offer. We've spent considerable time on this negotiation, and further haggling with Bob might not yield a better outcome.  John's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, ensuring we don't lose out."
