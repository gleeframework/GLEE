"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $120 is still above Bob's maximum value of $150.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but my budget is a bit tighter. Would you be willing to do $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum value of $80. This allows for continued negotiation without jeopardizing the deal.  Bob is signaling that he's serious about buying the product but expects a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum value.  He has more room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in this product and think $105 is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making another counteroffer, slightly higher than his previous offer, but still below Alice's current offer.  This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate but also shows he's not willing to accept her price just yet. It's a strategic move to keep the negotiation moving forward without risking losing the deal."
