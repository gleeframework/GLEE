Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but my budget is a bit tighter. Would you be willing to do $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $100 is more than the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in this product and think $105 is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price,  $105 is a good compromise and within my acceptable range.  It's better than selling to John for $80."
