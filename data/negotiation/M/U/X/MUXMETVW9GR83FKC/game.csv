"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $6,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $7,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8,500. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
