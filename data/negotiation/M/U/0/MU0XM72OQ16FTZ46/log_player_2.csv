"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $10,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, so he starts by offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price. He's hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate down from her original price, and he's willing to pay up to $8,000 if necessary, but wants to see if he can get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. He's still aiming for a lower price and has multiple rounds left to negotiate.  There's a good chance he can get a better price with a counteroffer, and he can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price but wants to try one more time to see if he can get Alice to meet him halfway. $8,500 is a reasonable compromise, and he's confident that Alice will be more inclined to accept this offer than his previous one."
