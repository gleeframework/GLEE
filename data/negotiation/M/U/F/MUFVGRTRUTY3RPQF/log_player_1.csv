Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. I'm asking for $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price, we can aim significantly higher initially. Starting at $1,200,000 allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing our bottom line. It aims to pique Bob's interest and potentially justify the high price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer anticipates a counter-offer from Bob. If he's serious, he'll negotiate. If he rejects outright, we haven't lost anything because we have John as a backup. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have some flexibility in our negotiation and are willing to potentially lower the price to secure a deal with Bob."
