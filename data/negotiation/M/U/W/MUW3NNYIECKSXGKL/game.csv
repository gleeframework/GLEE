"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to the $1000000 mark. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Would you be open to discussing a price around $1050000? ",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm happy to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm proposing a price of $1075000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I have in the product. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
