I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it?,100.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $85.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,105.0
"I understand you're looking to spend $85, but I have to make a profit. I can meet you halfway between $85 and my initial offer of $100. How about we try $92.50?",92.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference again and try $90? It's closer to my target and I think it would be fair to both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,97.5
"I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob! I can understand that. However, I've already compromised quite a bit from my initial offer of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $92.50, which is $91.25. How about we try that?",91.25,Alice,5,,
