"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth $120 to you, but Alice's offer of $100 is still too high.
* **Negotiation:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $85.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend $85, but I have to make a profit. I can meet you halfway between $85 and my initial offer of $100. How about we try $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  While $92.5 is closer to your target of $85, it's still above your ideal price point. You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product, but there's room for further negotiation.
* **Negotiation:** You still have 7 rounds to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference again and try $90? It's closer to my target and I think it would be fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob! I can understand that. However, I've already compromised quite a bit from my initial offer of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $92.50, which is $91.25. How about we try that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** While $91.25 is still above your ideal price, it's getting close to your acceptable range. You're willing to pay up to $120, so this is a good deal considering the potential of further negotiation.
* **Negotiation:** You've made significant progress, but with only 5 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better outcome.
* **Risk:** There's always the risk that Alice could reject your counteroffer and increase her price. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product within your budget and leaves room for potential savings if you continue negotiating."
