"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a clear opportunity to potentially save a significant amount of money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of this product's value, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,750,000 is still outside of Bob's budget.  It makes sense for Bob to continue negotiating to see if they can reach a more agreeable price. There's a possibility that they can close the gap and make a deal that benefits both parties."
