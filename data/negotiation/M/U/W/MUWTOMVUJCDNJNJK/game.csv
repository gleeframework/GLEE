"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of this product's value, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,750,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
