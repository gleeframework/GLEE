"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about $925,000? This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the outcome.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $925,000. How about $887,500? That's the best I can do.",887500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and the fact that we're getting closer. However, $887,500 is still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of this product, and it allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's finalize this.",900000.0,Alice,5,
