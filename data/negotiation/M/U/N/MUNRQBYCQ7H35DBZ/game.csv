"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that you might be interested in. I'm open to offers, but I'm looking for at least $150 for it. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $80?  I'm really interested, and that's the absolute maximum I can spend.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $120?  It's a fair price for this amazing product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested, but I can't go any higher than $95.  Let me know what you think.  I'm ready to make a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
