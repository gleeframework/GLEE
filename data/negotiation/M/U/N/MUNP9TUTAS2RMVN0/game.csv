"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $70? That feels like a fair compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $95?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $95 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $80.  Would you consider $75? That's a reasonable offer.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I think $90 is a more reasonable compromise. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Would you consider that?",90.0,Alice,7,
