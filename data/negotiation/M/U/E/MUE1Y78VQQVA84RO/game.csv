"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $107.50?  Let's make this happen!",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $107.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great product that you'll really enjoy. Let's close this deal!",100.0,Alice,5,
