(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your $8,000 budget. It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This will hopefully signal my serious intent to buy, while also pushing for a price closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my target price. There are still 7 rounds left, and I have the option to buy from John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to show some flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.  $9,500 is still a significant discount from Alice's price but is closer to my target budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price significantly, it's still above my target budget. With 5 rounds remaining, there's still time to try and negotiate a better deal.  It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but only by a small amount. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise.  At $10,000, I'm getting closer to my budget but still have some wiggle room if Alice needs a bit more. With only four rounds remaining, the pressure is on to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my target budget, and I'm starting to feel the time pressure.  With only three rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to negotiate a lower price.  While I would prefer to pay $10,000 or less,  $10,250 is still a good deal compared to Alice's initial price and John's offer. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice."
