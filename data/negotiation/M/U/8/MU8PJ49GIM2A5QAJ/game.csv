"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce the price slightly, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. My counteroffer is $1150000. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1125000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product at a fair price. I've already met you halfway twice, and you're still offering the same price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. My final offer is $1080000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What's it going to be?",1080000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I've already made a significant concession by offering the product for $1080000, and you're still not willing to meet me at a fair price. I'm starting to think it's time to walk away. However, I'll give you one last chance. My final offer is $1060000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1060000.0,Alice,9,
