"I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. Can you consider it?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,500?  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us. ",9250.0,Alice,5,
