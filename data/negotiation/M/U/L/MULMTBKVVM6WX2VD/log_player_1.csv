Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount. 
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so any offer to Bob needs to be significantly higher to be worthwhile.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with an offer of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. 

This strategy aims to:
    * Maximize your potential earnings from Bob.
    * Still keep the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
