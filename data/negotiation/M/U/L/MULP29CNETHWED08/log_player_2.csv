Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I'd like to counter your offer with a price of $900,000 for the product. This reflects the value we place on it and the benefits it offers. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still out of my range. I'm firm on my offer of $850,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within my budget.  Let's find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. To further accommodate you, I am willing to negotiate the price to $875,000. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while providing you with the best value for your investment.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within Bob's budget, and it's a good compromise.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that the price will go back up. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's within his budget and fairly close to his desired price."
