Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning you believe the product would be perfect for Bob and that you are offering it to him before a public listing, you are providing a soft justification for the higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the message suggests a firm price, it also invites Bob's thoughts, subtly leaving the door open for negotiation if he were to counter-offer. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, there's a chance Bob might reject a $10,000 offer outright. 
* If you want to be more risk-averse and ensure a sale, you could start with a smaller markup, like $9,000."
