"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $15000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 might still be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. How about we meet in the middle at $16500? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that $16500 was a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $16000? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price for a product of this quality.",16000.0,Alice,7,
