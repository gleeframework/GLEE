"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $14000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go that high.  My final offer is $10000.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
