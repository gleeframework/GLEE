"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, Alice is asking for $14,000.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal.  He's not in a rush to buy from John as the price is higher, and he knows Alice values the product at $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm only willing to pay $13,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product and your willingness to sell.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While Bob can try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject the offer, and Bob will have to either buy from John at a higher price or risk losing the opportunity entirely.  Accepting the offer at $13,500 is a good compromise that allows Bob to save money and still acquire the product."
