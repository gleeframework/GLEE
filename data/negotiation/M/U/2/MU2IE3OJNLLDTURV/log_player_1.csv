Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5

While $87.5 is closer to my target, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'd prefer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and settle on $88.50? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $86. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $86 isn't my ideal price, it's close enough to my lower limit and we're getting near the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better than selling to John for $80."
