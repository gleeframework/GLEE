"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $95?  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need a fair price, but $95 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference and go with $90. I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for something a little higher. Let's go with $92.  It's a small difference, and I think it's fair for both of us.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $91?  I'm confident we can finalize this deal at that price.",91.0,Bob,6,
