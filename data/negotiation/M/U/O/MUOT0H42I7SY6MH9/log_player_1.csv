"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's valuation but still lower than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate while also showing that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'm interested in making a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $95?  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you need a fair price, but $95 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference and go with $90. I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. Although it's closer to my minimum price, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for something a little higher. Let's go with $92.  It's a small difference, and I think it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $91?  I'm confident we can finalize this deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $91. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  It's better to secure a deal now than to risk losing Bob entirely and having to sell to John for a lower price."
