"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm excited about the possibility of working with you, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $950000 to you. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being reasonable given the market value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $950000, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $975000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm proposing $1025000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
