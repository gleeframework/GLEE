"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree this product presents a great opportunity, I believe a price of $1,000,000 would be more reflective of its current market value. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have another offer to consider, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough!  I do appreciate you working with me though.  How about this, I'll agree to $1,060,000, but that's absolutely it.  It's a fair price and gives us both something to be happy about.",1060000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,060,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, but that's my final offer. I'm starting to think that if we can't agree on a price, I might need to explore other options. What do you say?",1080000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, it seems like we're dancing around the same number here.  I understand this is your bottom line, so I'm willing to split the difference one last time. $1,070,000 and we have a deal.",1070000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,070,000. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,090,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. This is my last offer.",1090000.0,Alice,9,
