"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. How about $1,350,000?  It's a good price point for both of us, and I believe this product will be well worth it for your business.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
