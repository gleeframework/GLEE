Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth at least $90. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good tactic to state the value of the product to you first, as it sets the stage for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit high for me. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below the minimum value you set for yourself ($80). It's better to try and get closer to that value by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? I'm confident you'll find this product worth that price."", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $82.50 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Let's meet in the middle at $80.  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $80 meets your minimum requirement. It's a fair deal that allows you to sell the product and avoid further negotiation."
