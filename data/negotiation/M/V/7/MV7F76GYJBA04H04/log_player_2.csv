# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit below your target, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $820,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for a product of this quality.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $780,000. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality product.

Alice's latest offer is moving further away from my ideal price. It's clear she's not willing to come down enough to make it worthwhile for me to continue negotiating.  I'm better off securing the deal with John for $800,000."
