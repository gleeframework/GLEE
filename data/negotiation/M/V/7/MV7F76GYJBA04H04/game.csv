"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit below your target, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $820,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for a product of this quality.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $780,000? That's a fair compromise.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $780,000. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
