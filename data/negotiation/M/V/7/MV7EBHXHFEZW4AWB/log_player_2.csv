I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I've placed on the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. It's getting close, but I'm concerned that the price might not come down enough in the remaining rounds.  I'm going to go ahead and buy from John for $1,000,000."
