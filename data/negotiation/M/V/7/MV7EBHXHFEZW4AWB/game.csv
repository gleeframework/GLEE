"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to offer $900000.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value I place on this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I have to consider the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects its worth. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm going to counter with $950000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. I've given some more thought to the value of the product, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still need to ensure I get a price that reflects its worth. I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I've placed on the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
