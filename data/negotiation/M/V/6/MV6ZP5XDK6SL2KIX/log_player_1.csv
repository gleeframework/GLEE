Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I recognize your perspective, the value of this product is truly unique and I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is coming closer to our desired price, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming to get as close to $1,100,000 as possible before considering accepting. We'll use the next round to push a bit further."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has significantly closed the gap and is offering a price very close to our desired outcome.  Continuing to negotiate risks alienating Bob and potentially losing a deal that is significantly better than our alternative with John."
