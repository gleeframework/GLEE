"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiating from here.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.  I'm confident this price reflects a fair value for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $950,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise from my original offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
