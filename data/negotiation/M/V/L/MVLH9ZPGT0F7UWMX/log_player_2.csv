"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiating from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer, it's still above my budget. I will continue to negotiate to try and get a lower price.  I'm not yet willing to buy from John as I believe I can still get a better deal from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $950,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise from my original offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for me. While I could continue negotiating, it seems clear that we are not going to meet in the middle.  I'm at a point where it's more advantageous to buy from John for $800,000 and secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
