"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product,  $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1400000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the market and the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and potential returns. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1600000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1550000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous counteroffer. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
