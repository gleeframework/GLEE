"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the gesture, $900000 is a bit lower than I'm able to go at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950000. We believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and we're open to further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $950000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm prepared to offer $1050000 for the product.  This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
