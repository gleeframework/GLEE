"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While $9,000 is a decent offer, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John if you reject Alice's offer. This leaves room for potential negotiation with Alice or to stick with your backup plan."
