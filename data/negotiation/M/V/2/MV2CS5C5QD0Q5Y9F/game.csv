"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree this product is worth it.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, and I appreciate you meeting me a bit. How about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate, but $7,750 is still too far off.  Let's try $8,250.  It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away feeling like we got a good deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to make this work but I need to stay closer to my budget. Would you do it for $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,000 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference at $8,100. This feels like a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get what we need out of this deal.",8100.0,Alice,7,
