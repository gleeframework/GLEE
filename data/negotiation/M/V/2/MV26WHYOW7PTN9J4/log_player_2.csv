"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

We're still getting a better deal with John ($8,000) than Alice's current offer ($8,500). There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm aiming for closer to $7,000. How about $7,200?"", 
""product_price"": 7200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're strategically inching closer to John's price while leaving some room for further negotiation. This shows Alice we're serious but also budget-conscious."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7,800? This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best we can do in this negotiation. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer, but we're still only $200 away from John's price.  It's worth a shot to see if we can get closer to $8,000. We'll take a slight risk in rejecting her offer since it's already a decent price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, your offer is very tempting, and I appreciate you working with me. To be honest, my absolute limit is $7,900. If you're able to do that, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 7900
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're pushing our luck a little here, but this tactic accomplishes two things:

1. **Creates Urgency:** By stating a ""final offer"" and a ""limit,"" we aim to nudge Alice towards a decision.
2. **Minimizes Risk:** We're still below John's $8,000 price, so if Alice rejects this, we can accept John's offer without losing money."
