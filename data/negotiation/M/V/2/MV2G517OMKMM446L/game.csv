"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a more substantial counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Is this something you'd be willing to accept?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. It's a good compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $95 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $80, which is the price I'm willing to pay. I'm not willing to go any higher.",80.0,Bob,6,
