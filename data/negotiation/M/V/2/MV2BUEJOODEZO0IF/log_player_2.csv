"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than $100 from John, Bob can likely get a better deal. There's room for negotiation since the product is worth $80 to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $85?  That's still a good price for you, and a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92 is closer to Bob's target price, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is willing to meet Bob halfway, but Bob can still try to push for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $88? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $90, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is only $10 more than Bob's target price of $80.  While it's possible to keep negotiating, the risk of going back and forth is that Alice could decide to stick with her price or even increase it.  Accepting the offer is the safest option at this point, guaranteeing Bob gets the product for a price lower than John's offer."
