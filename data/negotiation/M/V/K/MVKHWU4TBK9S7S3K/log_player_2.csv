"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is way over that. It's best to reject and see if a counteroffer is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

Bob should start low, as Alice's initial price was very high.  Offering $8,000 is a significant discount and a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still too high. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but he should still try to get a lower price. $9,000 is a reasonable compromise, offering a further discount while still being significantly higher than his initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is tempting and getting closer to Bob's limit, he's still only one round away from getting the product from John for $10,000. Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

Bob has reached his limit, but it's important to try and get the best price. Offering $9,500 is a good compromise, showing a commitment to buying the product while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob has two options: accept Alice's offer of $10,500 or buy from John for $10,000. Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, the best option is to **buy from John**. Even though it's only $500 less, it's still a better deal than accepting Alice's offer.  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down any further, and Bob is running out of time."
