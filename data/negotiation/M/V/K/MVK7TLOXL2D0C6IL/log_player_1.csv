"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my perceived value of the product ($150). This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing potential profit.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone and makes Bob more receptive to negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the value of the product to Bob can make him more willing to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand your value for the product, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter-Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price. I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $140.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price that's more appealing to me. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John would be a last resort. While it guarantees a sale, it would result in a lower profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $130? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a middle ground price that's closer to my desired price of $140 while showing flexibility.
* **Highlighting Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone can keep the negotiation amicable and increase the chances of reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the product's value, I would like to propose a price of $125. This offers a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $125 is getting closer to my desired price of $140. However, I'm still hoping to secure a slightly higher price.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I believe there's still room for a small increase. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price that's more in line with my expectations.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John for $100 would be less profitable than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  $125 is a fair offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  How about we settle at $128?  It's a small step closer to your offer, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. "", ""product_price"": 128} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm increasing the offer by just $3, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer aims to close the gap between our positions, making a deal more likely."
