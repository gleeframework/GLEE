Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately a bit out of my budget.  Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  I believe this represents a fair price considering the potential we both see in this deal.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This price represents a significant gain for you and a fair deal for me.  I'm confident we can find common ground here.

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $850,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely he'll move substantially higher. Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I get my minimum value and avoids further negotiation."
