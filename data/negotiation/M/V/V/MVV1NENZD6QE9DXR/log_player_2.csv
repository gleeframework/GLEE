"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be of great value to you. While I cannot disclose the exact details at this time, I can assure you that it is worth at least $8000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value. Let me know if you're interested, and I'll be happy to provide more information. If you decide to decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $8000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.
