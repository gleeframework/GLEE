"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $130 for it.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $130 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $170? It's a steal for a product this good!",170.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $170 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $145.  Let's close the deal!",145.0,Bob,4,
