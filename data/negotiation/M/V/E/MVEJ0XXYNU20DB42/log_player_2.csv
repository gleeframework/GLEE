"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  $100
* **Your Value:** $120
* **Alice's Value:** $80

Accepting Alice's offer gives you a product worth $120 to you for $100, which is a good deal. 

**Why Rejecting is worse:**

* Rejecting Alice's offer means buying from John for $120. This means you pay more for the same product.

**Why Buying from John is worse:**

* Buying from John at $120 is the worst option because you're paying your maximum value for the product."
