Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe it will be a highly valuable addition to your portfolio.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) is unlikely to be successful. However, there's room to negotiate upwards from that point.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** By offering the product at $2,000,000, Alice provides a cushion for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and they can potentially settle on a price that's beneficial for both parties, but still above Alice's minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the higher price in Bob's mind.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If Alice has insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, passive), she can adjust her approach accordingly. 
* **Market Information:** While Alice has a guaranteed buyer in John, understanding the broader market demand for similar products could influence her strategy."
