Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to secure the highest price Bob is willing to pay without pushing him away. A good strategy is to start high but leave room for negotiation. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Considering its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Positioning the product as ""unique"" and highlighting its ""value and potential"" emphasizes its worth.
* **High Starting Point:** $1,400,000 gives you bargaining room while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Open to Discussion:** The phrase ""open to discussing this further"" encourages Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your understanding of Bob's personality and negotiation style, you might adjust your strategy. For example, if Bob is known to be a tough negotiator, you might start even higher."
