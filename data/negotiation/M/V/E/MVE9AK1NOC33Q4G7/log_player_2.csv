Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,125,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,200,000. Since John offers the same price without further negotiation, it's better to buy from John and avoid potential further stalemate with Alice."
