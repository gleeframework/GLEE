"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is quite low, and we have room to negotiate.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Could we possibly meet somewhere around $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer:

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is a close call. Bob is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, but we're also very close to John's guaranteed offer. There's a risk Bob won't go any higher.

It's a safer bet to take John's guaranteed $12,000 rather than risking Bob refusing to go any higher."
