"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000.  What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I could come down to $15,000.  It's a generous offer considering the worth of this product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Could we possibly meet somewhere around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $13,000?  That's a significant price reduction and a very fair offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I could do $11,000, and I think that's a very fair offer.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,6,
