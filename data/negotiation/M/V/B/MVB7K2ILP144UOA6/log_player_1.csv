Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values the product at $800,000, so this gives him room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to take $1,200,000 from John, so you have some flexibility to negotiate down.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  It makes it easy for Bob to understand what's being proposed. 

This strategy aims to initiate a negotiation while leaving room for potential counteroffers and still maximizing your chances of getting a favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you'd get from John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter and potentially push the price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would allow us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer does the following:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** It demonstrates that you're not inflexible and are open to finding a compromise.
* **Offers a reasonable counter:** $950,000 is a reasonable midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Maintains pressure:** While you're lowering the price, it's still above Bob's initial offer, giving him some incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still a significant distance from your desired price, and you have the opportunity to earn more from John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter and potentially push the price closer to your desired range, or even secure a deal closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $920,000 is still below where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers - $935,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  Demonstrates that you're willing to meet halfway, which can be appealing to Bob.
* **Stays above Bob's offer:**  Keeps the price higher than Bob's last proposal, maintaining pressure for him to accept.
* **Offers a concrete number:** Provides a clear and specific number for Bob to consider."
