"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would allow us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. Can we meet in the middle?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $920,000 is still below where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers - $935,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",935000.0,Alice,5,
