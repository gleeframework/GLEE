Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that we're close to a deal, but I'm not ready to accept your offer just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $825,000, but only if you're willing to throw in some additional services that will enhance the product's value. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  Here's why:

* **Stalemate:** Alice is stubbornly sticking to $825,000 even with the added condition of you providing extra services (which likely have a cost). This suggests she's unlikely to move much further.
* **Time is Money:**  You've used up 7 of 10 rounds.  Continued haggling with Alice risks letting a sure thing slip away.
* **John's Price is Acceptable:** While $1,000,000 is higher than you'd like to pay, it's within your budget and avoids the risk of completely losing the deal with Alice.

Sometimes a small loss (the extra $25,000) is preferable to the potential of no deal and having to restart negotiations elsewhere."
