"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. This is my highest offer, and I hope it aligns closer to the value I perceive in the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,075,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice's position, and I respect her valuation of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet her latest offer of $1,075,000. I would like to propose one final counteroffer of $1,060,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
