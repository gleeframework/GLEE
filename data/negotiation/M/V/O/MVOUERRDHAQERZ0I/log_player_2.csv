"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, we believe it's worth $1200000. To kick off our negotiation, let's start with a fair offer of $1100000. We're looking forward to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, considering the product's worth to me. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. We understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To reach an agreement that benefits both parties, we would like to counter with an offer of $1075000 for the product. This price reflects the value we place on the transaction while remaining within your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,200,000. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate a lower price, the risk of further negotiation falling apart and having to buy from John outweighs the potential savings."
