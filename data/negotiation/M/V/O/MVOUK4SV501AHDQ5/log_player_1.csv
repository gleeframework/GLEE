"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price and see if I can negotiate with Bob. Selling to John right now would mean losing a significant amount of profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I believe a price closer to $900,000 would be more suitable considering the product's value and potential for your business.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counter-offer of $900,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $850,000 is a fair price given the current market conditions and my budget constraints. I hope you can consider this proposal, as it closely aligns with your last offer while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is the best we can get at this point.  It's higher than what John is offering, and further negotiation may just lead to a stalemate.  It's time to close the deal and secure the profit."
