"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits the product could bring to my business.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $875000. This price still represents a great value for the benefits the product will bring to your business, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $825000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider this offer?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'll consider $850000, but that's as low as I can go. This is already a compromise, and I'm confident the product will bring significant value to your business. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your compromise, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad you're willing to throw in some additional benefits to sweeten the deal. However, I've already made a compromise at $850000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll consider $835000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",835000.0,Alice,7,
