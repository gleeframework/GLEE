"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition,"" I'm aiming to anchor the price in Bob's mind around a higher value, even though I haven't specified what makes it so valuable *to him*. 
* **Leaving John as Leverage:** The option to sell to John for my minimum gives me a strong fallback position and the confidence to negotiate firmly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $1,500,000 on this purchase. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to explore if I can secure a higher price before accepting his offer or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however, the value of this product goes beyond even your initial assessment. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession to signal flexibility but remain above both my minimum and Bob's offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a higher target.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm subtly suggesting that Bob might be undervaluing the product, hoping to shift his perception without directly revealing its true worth to me. 
* **Time Consideration:**  While I have rounds to spare, I don't want to drag the negotiation unnecessarily. This offer keeps the pace brisk while still leaving room for further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the product's value, I still feel that $1,500,000 is a fair price given my budget. I would like to stick to that figure if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now firmly reiterated his maximum budget twice.  It's unlikely he'll go higher. Holding out for more risks losing him to a competitor and having to settle for John's offer, which is the same as Bob's current offer. It's time to secure the deal."
