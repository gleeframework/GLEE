Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $175 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Confidence:**  The message implies the product's value, making it more appealing even at a slightly higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could offer a price closer to $150."
