"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a budget constraint, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to make a profit, and $9000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is my best price for now, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $11500, which is as low as I can go. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'm thinking $10000 is the maximum I can go. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
