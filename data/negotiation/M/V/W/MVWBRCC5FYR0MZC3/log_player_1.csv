Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price of $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By starting high, I create space for Bob to make a counteroffer and for us to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Protecting My Value:** The price is also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. This means I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own financial needs.

I'll be monitoring Bob's response and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $13,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my initial offer of $14,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
* **Protecting my interests:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I want to see if I can achieve a higher price with Bob. 

I will now proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm counter-offering at $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $13,000. This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm taking his offer seriously.
* **Still Protecting My Value:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, ensuring that I'm not selling at a loss.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** This counteroffer provides a clear signal that I'm ready to close the deal, but not at a price that significantly undervalues the product.

By offering a price that is closer to Bob's, I aim to incentivize him to accept the offer and avoid the risk of potentially losing the deal entirely."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has consistently offered $13,000, demonstrating that he's unlikely to budge further.
* **Time is Money:**  The negotiation process is taking longer than expected, potentially costing me valuable time.
* **Securing a Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a solid profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

While I would prefer to sell at a higher price, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential for further negotiation with Bob."
