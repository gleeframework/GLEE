Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe the product's value to you is even higher than that, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's aim for a price that works for both of us. What do you think about $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

While $1,050,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than you'd like to pay.  You can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000, which is a bit closer to your last offer. I believe this price reflects the product's true value and is a fair compromise. What do you think?

You are still able to save more money. While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. It is better to reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
