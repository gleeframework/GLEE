"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe the product's value to you is even higher than that, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's aim for a price that works for both of us. What do you think about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. How about $950,000? This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's a price I believe is fair given the value of the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000, which is a bit closer to your last offer. I believe this price reflects the product's true value and is a fair compromise. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair price considering your last offer and my budget. I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,6,
