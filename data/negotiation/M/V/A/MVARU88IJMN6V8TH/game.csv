"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80 for this product. Would it be possible for us to reach a price closer to that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $80 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $110?  This still gives you a great price and allows me to make a fair profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we aim for $95? This would still be a substantial saving for me and might allow for a fair transaction.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $95 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's compromise at $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your patience and understanding. I really appreciate your flexibility. Considering our previous discussions, I believe $100 would be a fair price for both of us. It would allow me to stay within my budget while still providing you with a decent profit. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,6,
