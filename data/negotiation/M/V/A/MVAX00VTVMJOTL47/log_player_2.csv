"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $9,500 to $9,000, which is a significant concession.  Bob can save $1,000 compared to buying from John, and it's still within his budget.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but the potential savings are minimal, making this a good deal to accept."
