"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you, but I'm open to negotiations.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,250. This is as close to my minimum price as I'm willing to go.",12250.0,Alice,5,
