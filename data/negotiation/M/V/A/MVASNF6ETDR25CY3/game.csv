"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about we settle on $9,750? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,
