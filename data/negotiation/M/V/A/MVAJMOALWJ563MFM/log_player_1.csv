Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, and I know you'd benefit from it greatly.  I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you have leverage to start high. 
* **Targeting Bob's valuation:** You know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. By aiming higher, you might be able to get closer to his maximum willingness to pay. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A high initial offer gives you space to negotiate down if Bob pushes back, while still staying above your minimum price.

**Important:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust your offer."
