``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* This offer is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially maximize profit. 
* If Bob rejects, I can always go to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* I am confident I can get a better deal by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer in the next round. 
*  While John is a guaranteed sale, I am prioritizing maximizing my profit, and I believe further negotiation with Bob holds potential for a higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit far from reaching my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $1,025,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $1,020,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Explanation:**

* While Bob's offer of $1,020,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

* It's now more beneficial to accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. Although it's not the maximum possible price, it ensures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
