Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. While it's unlikely he'll accept this price, it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  Offering $1,300,000 leaves a significant margin for negotiation before reaching your guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. 
* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  Framing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds a sense of urgency and importance.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts the initial offer or a price close to it, you secure a higher profit than selling to John.
2. **Secure a Favorable Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates, the high anchor increases the likelihood of him agreeing to a price significantly above his initial valuation. 
3. **Maintain the Option of John:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can confidently sell to John at your desired price."
