Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm offering the product for $1,025,000.  This is my final counteroffer, as I believe it is fair considering the product's value and our back and forth.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell the product to John for $1,000,000."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation with Bob.  The risk of him rejecting my next offer and me being stuck with a lower price than John's offer is too great.  I will sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
