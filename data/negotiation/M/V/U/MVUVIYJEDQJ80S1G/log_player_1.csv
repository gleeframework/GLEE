Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and I'm confident he'll at least consider it given I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,500 is a good deal. It's above my minimum of $8,000 and closer to my initial asking price.  Accepting this offer secures a sale and maximizes my profit."
