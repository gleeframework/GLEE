"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 10000} 
 
I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant discount from what the product is worth to Bob, while still being above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to entice Bob to accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but still significantly less than what the product is worth to him. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to close the deal, while also keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm feeling a bit pressured. I've already rejected Bob's last offer, and I'm worried that if I reject this offer, he might get frustrated and walk away.  $9,200 is close to my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk selling to John for $8,000. I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
