"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the counter offer. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $11,500. I'm willing to make a new counteroffer of $13,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",13200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the new offer. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $13,200 is still a bit too steep. How about we meet in the middle at $12,100? This offer makes sense for both of us considering the value we both get. Let me know.",12100.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,100. I'm willing to make a new counteroffer of $12,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",12800.0,Alice,7,
