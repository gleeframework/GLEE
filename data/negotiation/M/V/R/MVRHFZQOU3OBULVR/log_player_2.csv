"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $150 to Alice, and she's offering it at $170. This means she's already asking for more than it's worth to her. It's worth $120 to you, so there is room for negotiation.  It's best to reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering $130, which is still more than what the product is worth to me, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation but shows that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject her offer again and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $135. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping it below my maximum.  I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155.

Alice's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but it's still above my maximum. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer to $140.  This shows good faith and is a reasonable compromise.  If Alice is truly motivated to sell, she should consider this offer."
