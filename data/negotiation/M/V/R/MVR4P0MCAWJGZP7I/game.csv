"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other buyers at this price point.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product while staying within my budget.  I believe this price reflects the potential benefits and is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
