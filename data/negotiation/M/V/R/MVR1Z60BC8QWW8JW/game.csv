"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit on the price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $8750. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8750 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8625?  That's a fair price for both of us.",8625.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $8750 is still a bit too low for me. Let me see... How about $8700? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to work with me. While $8700 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's try $8650. That's a good compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price.",8650.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8675. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",8675.0,Alice,7,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I can offer it to you for $8662.50, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about $8667.50? It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.",8667.5,Alice,9,
