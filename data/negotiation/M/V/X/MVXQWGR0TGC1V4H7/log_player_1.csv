{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $13,000 is well above your minimum of $10,000, so you're already securing a good profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still room for Bob to negotiate down if he wants, giving him some wiggle room and making him more likely to engage.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $13,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000), making it a potentially attractive offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $11,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe I can negotiate a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $12,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product highly valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
