"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer ($140):** While this is less than Alice's value, it's still more than your $100 maximum.
* **John's Offer ($100):** This meets your budget perfectly.

You can reject Alice's offer knowing you have a reliable backup with John."
