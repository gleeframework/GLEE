Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($12,000), I should accept his offer.
