Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're committed to your price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $875,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still $75,000 more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to continue negotiating in hopes of getting the price down further, but I'm also considering buying from John if we can't reach a deal soon.  I have limited rounds, so I need to be strategic."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. While $875,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still committed to $850,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still committed to $850,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one final offer: $880,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still $80,000 higher than my target. I've only got a few rounds left, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might not yield the desired result. With only three rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice is too high. Buying from John guarantees a purchase within my budget and saves me time and potential frustration."
