"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's a good deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. 
* You have a better option with John at $10,000, so rejecting Alice's offer makes sense. 
* You want to try and negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to do $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you have a budget.  $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's make this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer of $10,500 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* You have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000, which aligns perfectly with your budget.
* There is no significant benefit to continuing the negotiation with Alice, as she's already moved closer to her desired value."
