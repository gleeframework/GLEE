"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. To be honest though, that's still a bigger stretch than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
