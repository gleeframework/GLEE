"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $200 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $175. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $140. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's make this happen!",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $175 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $160. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",160.0,Alice,5,
