"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000 for the product. This reflects its value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad you see the value in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,375,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's make this deal happen!",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,382,500. This is a compromise that should work for both of us. Let's see if we can shake on it.",1382500.0,Alice,5,
