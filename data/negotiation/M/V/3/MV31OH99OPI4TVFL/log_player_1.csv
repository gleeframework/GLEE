Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to consider $9,000 as a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,000.  While I was hoping to get closer to my original asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John at a lower price.  $9,000 is a decent compromise and I'm satisfied with that outcome."
