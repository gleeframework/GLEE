"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. I believe it holds significant value and I'm confident this price reflects that. I'm open to discussing the price further, but I'm also happy to consider other offers. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1000000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $600000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $750000. This reflects my budget and the value I see in your product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
