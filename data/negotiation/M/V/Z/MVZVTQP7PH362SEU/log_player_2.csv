"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a great deal for Bob, but it's still worth seeing if Alice will go lower.  It's unlikely she'll go all the way to Bob's ideal price, but there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects the value to me and gives us both a solid starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $725,000 is still a bit high for Bob. It's worth trying to get a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $725,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's getting close to the original price I had in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is getting close to a good deal for Bob, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and Bob can always buy from John if a deal with Alice doesn't materialize."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're holding firm on the price, but $750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $720,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This price is a good midpoint between our last two offers and allows us to make progress toward a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 720000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $720,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer and meet you at $740,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $740,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has a few rounds left, but Alice is getting close to his desired price. It's not ideal, but it's a good deal compared to buying from John. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product while saving a significant amount of money."
