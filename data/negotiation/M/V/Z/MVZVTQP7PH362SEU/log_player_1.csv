Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects the value to me and gives us both a solid starting point for further discussion.

Round 6
