"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than Alice's initial value of $120, it's still above your maximum budget of $80. You can do better by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, offering $75. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still above my budget, even though it's lower than her previous offer. I'll continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting a lower price.  I can still buy from John for $80, so there's no risk in continuing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

This time, I'm offering my maximum price of $80. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that Alice will accept it. She has already lowered her price twice, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  She's likely to accept this offer to avoid losing the sale."
