Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) while ensuring we stay above our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While we start high, the message implies a willingness to negotiate, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
