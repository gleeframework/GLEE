"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. Given its immense value and utility, we believe it's worth every penny of its true worth, which is $15,000 to you. However, considering the current market conditions and the importance of making this transaction beneficial for both parties, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product for $12,000. This price not only reflects its high quality but also provides you with a significant value compared to its perceived worth. I look forward to your positive response. Kind regards, Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $12,000.**  You are willing to pay up to $15,000, so this is a good deal, but...
* **John will sell the product for $15,000.** This means you can get the product for $3,000 less than Alice's offer if you go with John.

Therefore, it's more beneficial to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
