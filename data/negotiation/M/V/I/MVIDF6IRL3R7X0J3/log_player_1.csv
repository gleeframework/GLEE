{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000.  Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob values the product even more than your minimum. By aiming higher, you might secure a better deal. 
* **Fallback Option:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, so there's less risk in starting high with Bob.

**Important:**  This strategy assumes you have some time and Bob isn't urgently seeking this product. If a quick sale is essential, a price closer to $1,500,000 might be more suitable."
