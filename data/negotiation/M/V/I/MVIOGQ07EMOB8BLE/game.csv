"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower the price to $1,050,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it's also a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
