"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better price.  $1,100,000 is more than I'm willing to pay right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower the price to $1,050,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still hesitant. I'm going to try and see if I can get Alice to go lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it's also a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is the best I can hope for. I'm going to accept her offer and buy the product."
