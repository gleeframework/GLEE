"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's perceived value, this initial offer will gauge his interest and potentially lead to a counteroffer revealing his range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and continue the negotiation to explore if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this price is reasonable,  giving Bob a better deal than his initial offer while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him to try and reach a better price, but I am also aware that I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.  I need to carefully weigh the potential of a better deal from Bob against the risk of not reaching an agreement within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, showing my willingness to compromise. However, this price still allows me to make a profit while staying above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this offer will be more appealing to Bob and bring us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I believe there's still room to get closer to my target price. It's a risky move, but I'll continue negotiating with Bob, mindful of the time constraint."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm making another concession with a counteroffer of $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise, considering my initial offer of $2,000,000.  This is a calculated risk, but I believe it's the best move to potentially reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a critical point. Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of time. It's risky to continue negotiating, as it might not lead to a better deal and could potentially result in no deal at all.  To avoid this risk, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and ensures a guaranteed sale."
