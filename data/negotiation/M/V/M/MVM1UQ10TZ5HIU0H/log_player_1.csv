Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me.

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."

We're at the end of our negotiations with Bob and his final offer of $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm running out of time and want to secure a deal.  Since John is willing to buy the product for my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, I'll sell to him."
