"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for a product worth significantly more to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I mention that the product is worth more to me, implying a higher quality or uniqueness that Bob might not fully grasp. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I end with a question, making it clear I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts and potentially adjusting the price. 

This approach aims to establish a strong initial position while inviting dialogue, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to push for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to close the deal closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our conversation, $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This represents a significant concession on my end, demonstrating my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reiterate Value:** I acknowledge Bob's offer while subtly reminding him of the product's value to me. 
* **Compromise:** I propose a price that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum threshold.
* **Emphasize Concession:** I frame my counteroffer as a ""significant concession"" to emphasize my willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message focuses on finding a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" promoting collaboration and a sense of fairness. 

This strategy aims to signal that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $1,600,000 is a bit high. Considering the value of the product to me, how about $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher offer from Bob. Additionally, I'm at risk of losing the deal entirely if we continue to go back and forth. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a guaranteed sale at my minimum threshold, which is the best outcome given the current situation."
