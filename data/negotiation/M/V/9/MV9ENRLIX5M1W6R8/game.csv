"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our conversation, $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This represents a significant concession on my end, demonstrating my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1600000.0,Alice,3,
