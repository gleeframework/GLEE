Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $20,000 price point. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still find it challenging to justify spending $17,000 on this product. I would like to stick to my maximum budget of $10,000. Could we possibly come to an agreement closer to this figure?

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer, which is significantly less than my minimum and John's guaranteed offer. It's time to move on to a buyer who recognizes the product's value."
