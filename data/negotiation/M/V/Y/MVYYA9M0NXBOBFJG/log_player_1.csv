Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but it leaves room for negotiation and makes the offer appear more enticing. 
* **Alternative Buyer Security:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, we have the safety net of John who's ready to buy at our desired price. 

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while still maintaining a high likelihood of a successful sale."
