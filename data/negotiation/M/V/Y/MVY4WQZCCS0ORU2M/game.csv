"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to make this deal work. This is still a great price for you, considering the product's value. Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. To be honest, $1,050,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $975,000 is still significantly below the product's value.  Let's try $1,025,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, and still leaves you with a good deal. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit more. I'm getting closer to a price I can work with. Would you be willing to settle at $1,000,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
