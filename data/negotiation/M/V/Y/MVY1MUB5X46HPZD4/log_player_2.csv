"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to work with you to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm excited to consider Alice's offer. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to her, I'm not sure why she's offering it to me for $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to consider the offer. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll have to think carefully about this decision.

I'll reject Alice's offer for now and consider buying the product from John for $1,500,000. I can save $200,000 by doing so.
