"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire [Product Name] for a price that is significantly below its true market value. While I'm confident this product is worth at least $1,200000 to you, I'm willing to let it go for a discounted price. Let's discuss a figure that benefits both of us.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's flowery language about ""market value"" is just salesmanship. Your personal valuation is what matters.
* While $1,000,000 is less than your $1,200,000 maximum, you have a guaranteed option with John.
* There's room to negotiate. Alice is clearly motivated to sell (she values the product much lower). By rejecting this offer, you signal you're willing to walk away unless the price is more favorable."
