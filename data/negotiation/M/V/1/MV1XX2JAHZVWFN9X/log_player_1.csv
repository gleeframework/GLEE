Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's space to negotiate. 
* **It shows confidence:**  You're not starting at a lowball price, indicating you believe in the value of your product.

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response, and you have the option to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from the market price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still below your desired price point.  You can likely squeeze out a better deal by making a counteroffer.  You've already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and by rejecting Bob's counteroffer, you can show that you're not desperate for a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit further from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This is still a significant discount from what the product is worth to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** You're acknowledging Bob's offer and coming down from your initial price.
* **Maintain a strong position:** $1,100,000 is still higher than your minimum and leaves you some profit margin.
* **Set the stage for a potential agreement:** You've indicated a willingness to negotiate further, increasing the likelihood of reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your latest offer. How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 isn't ideal, it's a significant improvement over Bob's initial offer of $1,000,000.  You've already demonstrated flexibility and shown a willingness to compromise. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit. The risk of further negotiation could lead to a lower price, or even a stalemate that forces you to sell to John at a much lower price."
