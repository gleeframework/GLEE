"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from the market price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit further from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This is still a significant discount from what the product is worth to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your latest offer. How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
