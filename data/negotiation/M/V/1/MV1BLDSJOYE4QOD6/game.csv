"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for and I believe it's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $12,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand $10,000 is your preferred price, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this deal work for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,250? It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.",11250.0,Alice,3,
