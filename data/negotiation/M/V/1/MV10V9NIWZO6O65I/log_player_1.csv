"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $10,000.  It's worth a lot more to you, so I think this is a fair price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $10,000.  Bob's initial offer is too low, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am unable to agree to $9,500. My counteroffer remains at $8,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge on his price.  He's stuck at $8,000, which is my minimum, but I've already given a significant discount and don't want to risk further negotiation.  Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees me my minimum, and avoids the possibility of further haggling with Bob that might lead to a stalemate."
