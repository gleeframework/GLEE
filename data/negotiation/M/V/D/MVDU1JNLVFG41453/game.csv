"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little, but the gap is still too wide. To make this work, I'd need to see it closer to $900,000.  That's a serious offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is still not quite there. How about $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's work together to find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell we're both motivated to make a deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $975,000? It's a win-win.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet at $1,025,000? It's a reasonable compromise that values the product and allows us to close this deal. Let's make it happen.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
