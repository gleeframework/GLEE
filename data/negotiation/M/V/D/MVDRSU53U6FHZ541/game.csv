"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1,050,000? This is a compromise that still benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000. Would that work for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $1,025,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
