Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While it's certainly interesting,  $900,000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
