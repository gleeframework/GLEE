"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,150,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1110000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,110,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000. This offer is a good compromise for both of us and lets us move closer to a deal.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. I've been considering your offer carefully, and to be completely transparent, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,090,000? I believe that's a fair deal for both of us.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
