"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate and maximizes my potential earnings.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While $1,750,000 is a hefty price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This allows for negotiation and hopefully a compromise.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **I need to negotiate further:**  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I have 9 rounds left, and I need to continue negotiating to find a more agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If negotiations fail, I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I don't lose too much money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's price:** I'm lowering my offer to $1,200,000, which is closer to Bob's $850,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:** $1,200,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, so I'm not losing money.
* **Stressing the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that my offer is still a good deal for him. 
* **Seeking compromise:** I'm suggesting that we find a compromise to move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and is a fair compromise. I'm confident we can find a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $950,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I can't afford to take such a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I have 6 rounds left, and I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my target price. 
* **John is a fallback:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm aware that selling to John for $1,500,000 is a secure option if negotiations fail."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on price.  While I appreciate your offer, I need to make a profit on this deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair offer.  Let's close this deal, Bob."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:** I'm reducing my offer again, showing flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement.

* **Closing the deal:**  I'm urging Bob to close the deal, hoping to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in this product. Let's find a compromise in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $975,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a large loss.
* **Time is running out:**  I have 4 rounds left, but I need to be strategic.  I'm not convinced Bob will significantly increase his offer.
* **John is a better option:**  While I'm still open to negotiating, I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John for $1,500,000 is the more financially sound decision."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your commitment to reaching a deal. However, $975,000 is still too far below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's reach an agreement here, Bob."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm reducing my offer again, showing maximum flexibility and hoping to close the deal.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  $1,050,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer to the point where selling to John might be more profitable. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting that this offer is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Urgency:** I'm suggesting that this might be the final opportunity to reach an agreement, hoping to create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This offer demonstrates my serious intent to purchase the product, and it allows us to close this deal within a reasonable range. Let's finalize this agreement in the next round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the minimum:** While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still a significant loss.
* **Only two rounds left:**  With only two rounds remaining, I'm not confident that Bob will increase his offer enough to make the deal worthwhile.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a significant profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:** Despite the ongoing negotiation with Bob, it's more advantageous to sell to John at this point. The potential gains from further negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal entirely or settling for a much lower price."
