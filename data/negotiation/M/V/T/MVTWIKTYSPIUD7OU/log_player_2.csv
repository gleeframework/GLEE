You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows Bob to potentially negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive start:**  Bob needs to be assertive from the start to show Alice that he's serious about getting a lower price.
* **Reasonable counter:**  $850,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a profitable deal for her, considering her value of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.

You have three options:

* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** There's room to continue negotiating and potentially bring the price closer to Bob's target. 
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:** Accepting now would mean spending more than Bob is comfortable with, potentially leaving room for regret later.  It's better to continue negotiating to see if a more agreeable price can be reached."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and is a fair compromise. I'm confident we can find a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your commitment to reaching a deal. However, $975,000 is still too far below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's reach an agreement here, Bob.
