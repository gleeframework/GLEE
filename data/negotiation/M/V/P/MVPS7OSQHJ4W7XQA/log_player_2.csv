You should reject Alice's offer. You are willing to pay up to $800,000, and Alice's offer is too high. You have a good chance of getting a lower price by counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant concession, and it reflects the value I see in your potential as a customer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down in price, $950,000 is still above your maximum budget.  You should reject the offer and counter-offer again. There's still room for negotiation, and you want to keep pushing for a price closer to your limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $975,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential for a mutually beneficial partnership. I believe this offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal that works for both of us.

Alice's latest offer is still above your maximum budget. While you could continue negotiating, you are likely to reach an impasse. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000.  You'll save yourself time and potential frustration."
