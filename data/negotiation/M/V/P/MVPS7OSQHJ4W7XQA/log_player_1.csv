Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You still have room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's a clear offer:** It sets the stage for negotiation and gives Bob a specific number to react to.

Remember, the goal is to get as close to your minimum value ($1,200,000) as possible. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially make counteroffers if Bob rejects your initial offer. You also have the safety net of John's offer to fall back on if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round.  I have the option of selling to John for a much higher price, so I'm in a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant concession, and it reflects the value I see in your potential as a customer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:** $950,000 is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer while still being significantly above his initial price.
* **Show flexibility:**  By coming down from my original offer, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterate value:** I highlight the potential benefit of a successful deal, reminding Bob that he could get the product for a price still well below its worth to him. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still positioning me to potentially get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price, and I'm confident I can push for a better deal.  I have the option of selling to John for a much higher price, so I'm in a strong position to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $975,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential for a mutually beneficial partnership. I believe this offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Signal serious intent:**  It shows Bob that I am genuinely interested in reaching a deal, but I am also not willing to undervalue the product.
* **Close the gap:** This offer is a clear compromise, suggesting I am willing to concede but still seeking a price closer to my minimum.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the product's value, reminding Bob of the potential for long-term gains.

By offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer, I am demonstrating flexibility while also setting a clear benchmark for the next round of negotiations."
