"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $2,200,000.  What do you think?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,200,000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price to something closer to my maximum budget of $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm confident this product can bring you substantial benefits.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. While I appreciate the middle ground you've proposed, I still feel that $1,800,000 is quite high for me. Could we possibly negotiate down to $1,200,000? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still acquiring the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
