{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate a better price before committing to a purchase.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

Let's start by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will give us some room to negotiate.  We can always go higher if she rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is still above our target price, but we're making progress. Let's try another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}

Let's increase our offer slightly, but still stay below Alice's latest price.  This shows we're serious about buying the product, but we're not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to our target price. While we could try to negotiate further, it's getting risky. Accepting the offer will save us $4,200 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal, and we're getting closer to our goal of saving money."
