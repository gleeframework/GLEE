"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. It's important to start high to leave room for negotiation and hopefully secure a good price.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in a serious discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, it's still too low considering the value of the product to me. I want to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 
I'm offering a counter-price of $1,750,000. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still holding onto a good portion of the value I see in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counter-offer again. While John is a sure thing for $1,500,000, there's still a chance I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm offering $1,600,000. This is a further compromise, but still above my minimum threshold.  I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, hoping he'll recognize the value of the product and come up to a more agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet me halfway. His latest offer is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. To avoid further negotiation with a seemingly stubborn buyer, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's a guaranteed deal and secures a fair price for the product."
