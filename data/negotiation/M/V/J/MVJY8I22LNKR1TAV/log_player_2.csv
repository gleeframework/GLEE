# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to someone in your position.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
