"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable with my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my initial asking price to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects the significant value this product brings to your operations.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $775,000. Can you consider this offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $775,000 is still below the value I need to receive for this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $800,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value this product offers.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
