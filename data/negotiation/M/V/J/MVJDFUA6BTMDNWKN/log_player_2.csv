"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her offer to $1,050,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Since there are still rounds left, rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is determined to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price to $1,025,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Given that Bob has only 5 rounds left, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
