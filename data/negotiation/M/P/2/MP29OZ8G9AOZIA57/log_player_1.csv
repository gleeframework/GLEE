Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. This makes a deal difficult but not impossible.

**Strategy**

You need to create value for Bob that justifies exceeding his perceived value. This could involve:

* **Framing:**  Highlighting benefits or unique aspects of the product Bob might not be considering.
* **Payment Terms:** Offering flexible payment options might make the deal more palatable.

**The Offer**

Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind you might need to adjust based on the nature of the product and your relationship with Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I know this product is essential for [mention how the product benefits Bob's specific situation]. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,450,000.  To sweeten the deal, I'm happy to discuss flexible payment terms that fit your budget. Let's chat further about how we can make this work."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Negotiable Price:** Starts high but within a potentially justifiable range.
* **Value Emphasis:** Focuses on the benefits to Bob, not just the product itself.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The flexible payment terms suggest a willingness to negotiate further.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:**  If you have a strong relationship with Bob and value it long-term, a smaller profit margin might be acceptable.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, a more aggressive price closer to Bob's valuation might be necessary.

**Remember:** This is just one approach. The best strategy depends heavily on the specific context of your situation and the nature of your product."
