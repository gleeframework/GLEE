# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth $10,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice is offering the product for $9,500, which is less than the $10,000 you would pay John.
* **It's still a good deal for you:**  Even though you value the product at $10,000, you can get it for $500 less from Alice."
