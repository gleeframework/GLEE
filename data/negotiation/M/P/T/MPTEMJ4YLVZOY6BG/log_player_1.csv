Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it's not so high that it will immediately scare Bob off.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if we can negotiate a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to sell to John for $80, I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob. $80 is my absolute minimum, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90.  This is a compromise, but still above my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just slightly above my minimum, and I'm running the risk of him walking away. It's better to secure the sale for $82.5 than to continue negotiating and potentially lose the deal altogether."
