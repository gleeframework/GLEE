**Reasoning:**  

While Bob is slowly increasing his offers, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's $100 offer within the remaining rounds. Accepting Bob's current offer would only get us $97.50.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $100 from John."
