Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you and I believe it's also a great value at $95 for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good deal, it's still higher than the product's value to me ($80). It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if I can come up with a better deal for both of us. How about $90 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is closer to my target, but I'm still confident I can get it lower. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $87? That would be a fair price for both of us and help me stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground here. Considering your budget constraints, how about we settle on $88 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $88, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me ($80). While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at $100 is not worth it. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids potential complications."
