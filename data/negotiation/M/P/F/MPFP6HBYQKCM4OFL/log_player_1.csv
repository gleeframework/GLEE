Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good profit.  I'll see how Bob responds before considering other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise, offering a price higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial asking price. Hopefully, this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer of $150, and while it's still lower than my initial asking price, it's getting closer to what I'd like to get. I'll accept this offer and move on."
