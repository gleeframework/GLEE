"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

The product is worth no more than $80 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes sense to reject and attempt to negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $80. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $120 is better than Alice's initial offer, it is still above your budget of $80. It's best to continue negotiating or explore the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still too high for me. I'm very serious about wanting this product, but my absolute maximum is $80.  If you're not willing to go that low, I might have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already met you halfway at $120, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

Alice is still asking for more than you're willing to pay.  At this point, it's better to stick to your budget and buy the product from John for $80.  You've already made it clear that you're serious about wanting the product, and Alice is unwilling to meet your price."
