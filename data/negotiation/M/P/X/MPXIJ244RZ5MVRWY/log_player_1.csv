"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a strong opening move, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate down from this price. If he doesn't, I can always fall back to John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than my minimum, it's still too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come back to the negotiation table with a more reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $11,000. While it's not the highest price I could have gotten, it's above my minimum and a significant increase from the previous round.  It's also getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely and being forced to take John's offer of $8,000."
