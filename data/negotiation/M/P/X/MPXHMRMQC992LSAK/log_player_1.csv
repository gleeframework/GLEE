Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for what it offers."", ""product_price"": 200} 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level and potential for negotiation. If he flat-out rejects it, we know he's looking for a much lower price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  We always have John as a backup who's willing to pay $150, so there's less pressure to settle for a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Value:**  Bob offered $120, which is significantly more than his perceived value of the product ($80). This suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Closer to John's Offer:** While $120 is closer to our fallback option of selling to John, we're aiming to maximize profit. It's worth seeing if Bob will go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $170?"",
""product_price"": 170
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** We're dropping the price by $30, which shows flexibility, but we're still well above our minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to see how much further Bob is willing to go. It's a good middle ground between his offer and our initial asking price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By staying above $150, we're not putting ourselves in a position where we're forced to accept a low offer just to avoid selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob is offering $140, which is still significantly more than his perceived value of $80.
* **Close Enough to John's Offer:** While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more from Bob, $140 is close enough to John's offer of $150. It's not worth the risk of pushing Bob away and potentially losing both deals. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time. Accepting this offer provides a reasonable profit without prolonging the process."
