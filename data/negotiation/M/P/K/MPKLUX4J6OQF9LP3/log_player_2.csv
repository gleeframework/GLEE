"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate towards a price that's better than John's $100 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is a bit aggressive, aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my target price. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  While low, it leaves space to negotiate upwards if Alice completely rejects it. I'm willing to go up to $99 before I'd consider John's offer.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is framed politely to maintain a positive tone in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $70 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room to haggle. Her product is only worth $80 to her, so she's likely willing to go a bit lower.  I'll try to meet her halfway between our last offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. How about we settle in the middle at $77?"", 
""product_price"": 77
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise quickly by suggesting the midpoint between our last two offers ($70 and $85).
* **Staying Below John's Price:**  This price still allows for significant savings compared to buying from John.
* **Maintaining Politeness:** The message continues the polite and respectful tone of the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob! I could meet you at $81, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $81 is a solid price for the product, saving $19 compared to John's offer.
* **Final Offer:**  Alice has signaled that she's unwilling to go lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to negotiate further might backfire, leading to a stalemate and forcing me to buy from John at the higher price."
