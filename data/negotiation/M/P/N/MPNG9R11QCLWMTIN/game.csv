"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is a very fair offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that the product has value, but $11,000 is still too high for my budget. I could go up to $7,000, but that's my absolute limit.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we both see the value in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go as low as $7,000. Let's make this work - how about $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,500 is closer, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. Could we settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,6,
