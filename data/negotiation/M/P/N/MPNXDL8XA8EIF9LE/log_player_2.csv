"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested. I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it still means paying $400,000 more than Bob's maximum value. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to buy from John and save $400,000."
