Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase [product name] before I make it available to other buyers.  Given the value this product brings, I'm setting the price at $1,900,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price from John, I want to start high to maximize my potential profit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's value, I'm subtly anchoring Bob's perception to a higher price point.
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""before I make it available to others"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While my initial offer is high, I'm open to negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price that's still significantly higher than my minimum."
