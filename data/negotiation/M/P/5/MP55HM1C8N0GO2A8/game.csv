"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit on the price, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
