Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I appreciate your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than that to me.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I think this is the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

While further negotiation might be possible, Bob's offer is getting too far away from my minimum acceptable price. It's time to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John and move on."
