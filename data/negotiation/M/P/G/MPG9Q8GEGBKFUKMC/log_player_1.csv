Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum value, aiming to maximize your potential profit.  However, it's important to note that this is just a starting point and you'll need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, and even lower than the guaranteed price from John. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal from Bob, as it's still possible he's willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. This shows you're willing to negotiate but also that you value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it's still lower than John's offer.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price. It's a compromise, closer to Bob's last offer, but still above your minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects this offer, you'll know it's time to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still lower than what John is offering, and it's unlikely that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a better price.  It's time to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed profit."
