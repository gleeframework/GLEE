"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to enter a negotiation and potentially get a better price.  While buying from John is an option, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to see if you can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is below my initial expectations, I understand you see value in this product.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,900,000?  This accounts for its true worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get a price closer to my maximum of $1,000,000.  Rejecting this offer allows me to counteroffer again and potentially get a better deal."

I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
