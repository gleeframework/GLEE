"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value you place on it and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is below my initial expectations, I understand you see value in this product.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,900,000?  This accounts for its true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still outside of my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,550,000, which is a fair compromise that accounts for the value of the product and my financial limitations.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
