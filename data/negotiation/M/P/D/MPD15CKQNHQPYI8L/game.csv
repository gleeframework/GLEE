"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1500000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I believe it will be a game-changer for your business.  Let me know what you think!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1350000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1100000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
