{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $14,000 is above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a bold counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. This is a strategy to see if Alice is willing to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. If she rejects this offer, it will give me an idea of her lower limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $13,000 is still too high. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further with Alice.  There are still rounds left, and I'm hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $10,000, which is my maximum budget. This is my final offer, and if Alice doesn't accept, I will purchase from John.  This is a clear signal to Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal at this price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $12,500 is closer to my budget than previous offers, it's still over my maximum price point. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price with Alice. If she doesn't budge, I'll buy from John in the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $11,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating that I'm willing to meet her halfway.  However, I'm still aiming for a price lower than $12,500. If she rejects this, I'm likely to purchase from John in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $12,200 is a tempting offer, I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price. I have a few rounds left, and I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further. If she doesn't, I'll buy from John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm raising my counteroffer again to $11,500.  I'm feeling confident that Alice will eventually accept, but if she doesn't, I'm prepared to buy from John in the next round. This is my final attempt at a counteroffer before accepting John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has consistently been unwilling to budge much, and I'm running out of rounds.  At this point, it's not worth risking another counteroffer and potentially losing the chance to buy from John. I'm going to accept John's offer to secure the product within my budget."
