I'm excited to offer you the product at a competitive price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $15000. Let me know if you're interested!,12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to get a better deal than $12000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $9000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $11000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $11000 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market value.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but $10000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market value.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you at a price that's closer to my target. How about we discuss a price of $11000? I'm willing to pay a bit more than that, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $11000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss a price of $12000? It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12000.0,Alice,7,
