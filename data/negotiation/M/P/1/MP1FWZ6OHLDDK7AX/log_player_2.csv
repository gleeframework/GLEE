"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $900,000, which is a significant drop from Alice's initial price of $1,100,000. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, giving Alice room to counter if she desires, while still saving me a substantial amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is still too high.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still within my range for negotiation. By rejecting, I can continue to push for a better price and potentially get closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $1,000,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $900,000 and Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000.  This demonstrates my willingness to meet halfway while still aiming for a price below my maximum budget.  It's likely to encourage further negotiation and potentially lead to a final price that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is lower than her previous one, it's still too high. I'm willing to pay a little more than my initial offer of $1,000,000, but not that much. By rejecting, I can try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $1,100,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000. This shows a clear willingness to meet halfway while still saving a significant amount compared to Alice's initial asking price. I believe this offer is reasonable and could potentially lead to a successful agreement."
