"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While your offer is tempting, I'm still valuing the product closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's inherent value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,300,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this revised offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
