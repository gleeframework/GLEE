Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so I want to make a profit.
* **John's offer:** I have a safety net of $1,000,000 from John, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive with my price.
* **Unknown value to Bob:**  I don't know Bob's willingness to pay, so I'm offering a price that is a significant markup but still potentially attractive. 

**Outcome:**

* If Bob accepts, I make a $500,000 profit.
* If Bob rejects, I can sell to John and still get my minimum desired value."
