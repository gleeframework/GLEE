Round 2
Bob's offer:

At this point, Bob's offer is getting close enough to your desired outcome that it makes sense to accept.  Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:**  You're securing a profit of $293,750 over your minimum ($1,093,750 - $800,000).
* **Diminishing Returns:** The increments of negotiation are getting smaller. Holding out for another round or two might only net you a few thousand more.
* **Time Value:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more opportunity cost you incur. Accepting now means you can use the funds for other investments or opportunities."
