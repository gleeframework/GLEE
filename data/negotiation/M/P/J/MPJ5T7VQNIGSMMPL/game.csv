"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position but I'm on a tight budget. Could we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise I think.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  That's my absolute minimum, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
