Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can find a better price for both of us. How about $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate it. Let's try $90 again, as it was my initial offer and I believe it's fair. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

While I could push for a higher price, Bob seems firm on $90. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of him walking away and ensures a profit above my minimum."
