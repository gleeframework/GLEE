"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that while still allowing me a fair profit. If you're interested, let me know! If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing. She claims she'll sell the product for $8,000 to another buyer if you refuse, even though that's less than what it's worth to her ($8,000). By rejecting her offer, you call her bluff and increase your chances of getting a better deal.  You can always fall back on buying from John for $10,000."
