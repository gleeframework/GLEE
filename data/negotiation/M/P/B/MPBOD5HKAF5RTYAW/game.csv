"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $920000.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $875000. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions, and it would help us close this deal quickly.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875000 is a fair price for you, Bob, but I'm still not getting the value I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $950000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last two offers and offer $885000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering our previous discussions. Let's close this deal and avoid going to another seller.",885000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $885000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $915000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your commitment to negotiating, but $915000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000 for the product. It's a good compromise, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly.  I'm confident this is the best we can do to ensure a mutually beneficial outcome.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $920000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one, but I need to get at least $910000. I'm counteroffering at $910000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",910000.0,Alice,9,
