"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lowball offer, aiming to get a significant discount. He's offering $14,000, which is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and closer to his maximum budget. This aggressive counteroffer could potentially put pressure on Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $16,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant reduction from her initial price. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, accepting this offer is a reasonable choice, as it allows him to get the product at a price he's comfortable with. Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price, and there's a risk Alice could reject future counteroffers.  Additionally, there's the risk of losing the product if Bob keeps rejecting offers and runs out of rounds."
