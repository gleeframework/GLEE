Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal compared to what you could get from other sellers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}"
