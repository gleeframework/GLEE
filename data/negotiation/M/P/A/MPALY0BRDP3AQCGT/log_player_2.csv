"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum price of $1,000,000. It makes sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  I can potentially save some money by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal compared to what you could get from other sellers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her counteroffer of $1,025,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John for my desired price rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
