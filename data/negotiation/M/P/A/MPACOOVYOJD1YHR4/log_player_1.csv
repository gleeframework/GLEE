Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise:

* **It's better than selling to John:**  You get $2,000 more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  Bob still gets a good deal, saving $1,000 compared to what the product is worth to him. 

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, you increase the likelihood of him accepting the offer while still securing a profit for yourself."
