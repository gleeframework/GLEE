"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $20,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $14,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value and the product's features. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $20,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $17,000? This price reflects the quality and benefits you'll gain from it.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $15,000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product will bring me, but it's more in line with what I'm comfortable paying.",15000.0,Bob,4,
