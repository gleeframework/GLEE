"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price.  It's possible Alice is willing to go lower, and Bob can leverage the possibility of buying from John as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive but not overly so.  A $50,000 drop from Alice's offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  This shows Bob is serious about buying but also wants to save money.  He's willing to walk away if Alice doesn't budge much, but he's also showing her that he's a serious buyer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is only $25,000 higher than Bob's counteroffer.  This indicates that Alice is likely willing to come down a bit more, but the potential gain from further negotiation might not be worth the risk.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $75,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially prudent choice."
