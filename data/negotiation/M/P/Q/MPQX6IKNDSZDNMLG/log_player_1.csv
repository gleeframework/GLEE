Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation while still getting a good profit for myself.  I believe this is a fair starting point, as it's below Bob's perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me and hopefully appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $115, $105 is still significantly higher than selling to John. It's a good deal for me, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher."
