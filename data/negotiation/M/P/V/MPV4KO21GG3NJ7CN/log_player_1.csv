Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice knows its worth much more to her. Starting with a price closer to her desired outcome ($1,500,000) gives her room to negotiate.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" introduces a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Negotiation Space:** The offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. If Bob is completely unwilling to go above $800,000, Alice can always walk away knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer."
