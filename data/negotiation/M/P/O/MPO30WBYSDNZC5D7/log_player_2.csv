"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $9,500 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  $9,500 is a bit more than I'd hoped to spend.  How about $8,750?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her original price, Bob can still attempt to negotiate further. There's a chance he can get the product for closer to his desired price point of $8,750."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $8,850? I'm really close to my budget limit, but I think this price is fair considering your previous offer."", ""product_price"": 8850}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to your budget limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $8750, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is already a significant discount from my original offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is exactly what Bob offered in the previous round. It's a great price for Bob, as he's able to buy the product for $1,250 less than what he was willing to pay from John. There's little benefit to further negotiation as Alice has already made a significant concession."
