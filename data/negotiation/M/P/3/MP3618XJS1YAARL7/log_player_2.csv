"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate but buying from John for $800,000 is my backup plan if I can't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I am interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still too far apart. I'll counteroffer again, but I need to start moving closer to my walk-away price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I have a hard limit at $750,000. If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to push the price a bit higher, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $750,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is my final offer before considering other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough one. Alice is implying this is her last offer, but it's still above John's price. I'll push back one more time, but I'm getting close to taking John's offer if Alice won't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're close, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $775,000 and no higher. That's my absolute best offer. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 775000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $775,000, which would be $800,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my backup price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate or going with John.  This is a fair deal."
