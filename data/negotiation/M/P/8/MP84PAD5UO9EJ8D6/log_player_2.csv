"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and even lower than the price John is willing to sell it for.  This is a good deal for you, allowing you to save $300,000."
