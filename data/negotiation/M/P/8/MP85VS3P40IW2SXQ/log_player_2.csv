"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is well within your budget of $15,000. It's a good deal, and there's no need to risk a counteroffer potentially failing and ending up paying John $15,000."
