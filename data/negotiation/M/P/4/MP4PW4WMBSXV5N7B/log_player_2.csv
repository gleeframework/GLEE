"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $9,000.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and he's willing to pay up to $10,000.  There's room for negotiation to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need a price closer to $8,500 to make it work for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,750, which is still within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John for $10,000.  While Bob could try to counteroffer again, the risk is that Alice might not budge further, and he'd end up paying more. It's a good deal, so it's better to accept and save the time and potential frustration of further negotiation."
