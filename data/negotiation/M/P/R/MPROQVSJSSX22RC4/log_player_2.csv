"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This gives us room to negotiate and aims to understand her lowest acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, we're still not at a price point that reflects a significant saving. Let's counter again and see if we can push closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $97? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 97
}
```

We're inching closer to a price that works for us. Offering $97 puts us closer to our target and keeps the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $102, but that's as close as I can get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly signaling that $102 is her bottom line.  While we'd prefer to be closer to $90, accepting at $102 saves us $18 compared to John's offer.  It's a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation stalling."
