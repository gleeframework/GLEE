Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000 is a good starting point.** It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, and it's still a good deal for Bob since the product is worth $15,000 to him.
* **The message is friendly and straightforward.** It establishes a potential benefit for Bob and doesn't come across as overly aggressive. 
* **It leaves the ball in Bob's court.** This invites him to respond and start the negotiation process. 

By choosing this price and message, I'm aiming to get the best possible price while keeping the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I can still try to get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $11,000 is closer to what I need, I'm hoping we can split the difference. How about $12,000? It's still a good value for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $12,000, showing flexibility while still aiming for a good price. 
* **Reinforce the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making my counteroffer seem more reasonable.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm staying friendly and open to negotiation, making it more likely Bob will consider my offer.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us and helps keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price that works for both of us, Alice. How about we settle at $11,500?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $11,500. This is very close to my bottom line, and while I'd love to get more, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale above my minimum and allows me to move on. It's a good compromise that brings us both closer to our desired outcome."
