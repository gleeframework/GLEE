"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and counteroffer or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $13000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's getting closer. You're better off rejecting and counter-offering again, aiming for something closer to your $10,000 limit.  You can always buy from John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and I pay $11,500? That seems like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure $11500 is quite enough for me to let it go, but I'm willing to meet you a bit closer to that number. I can do $12200. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than your budget, and while it's possible to continue negotiating, it's likely you'll be stuck in a stalemate.  John is offering the product at your desired price, so it's the most sensible option to buy from him."
