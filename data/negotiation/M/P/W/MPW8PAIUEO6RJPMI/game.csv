"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $13000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $13000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and I pay $11500? That seems like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $11500 is quite enough for me to let it go, but I'm willing to meet you a bit closer to that number. I can do $12200. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12200.0,Alice,5,
