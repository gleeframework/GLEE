Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point, and allows some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can always lower the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'd prefer to get a bit more.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to move up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $13,500. This is a reasonable compromise - it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I hope this is enough to entice Bob to accept, but it's still a good price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has moved up a bit from his previous offer. While I'd still like to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting $12,500 is a good outcome. It's above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
