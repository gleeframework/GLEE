"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. However, I still cannot go above $8,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While I could push for a higher price, Bob seems firm on his $8,000 limit. Accepting his offer is the most logical choice at this point to ensure a sale and avoid potentially losing both Bob and John as buyers."
