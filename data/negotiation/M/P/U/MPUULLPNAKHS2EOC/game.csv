"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me is $1000000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1500000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'd like to propose a price of $1150000. This is a compromise that I think is more in line with what I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass. I've decided that the product is worth no more than $1000000 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $1250000. I'd like to reiterate that I'm willing to buy the product from John for $1000000, and I think that's a fair price. I'm going to have to consider that option if we can't come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
