"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I know Bob values the product at $120, so there is room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I believe I can get closer to that amount by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $160. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum price.  I believe this is a reasonable price that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $145 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a higher price. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $155. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum price. With only 5 rounds left, I'm trying to find a price that both Bob and I can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $147. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $147
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiation is becoming increasingly difficult. Bob's offer of $147 is close, but still below my minimum. I'm not confident I can get a better price within the remaining rounds. Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $150 to guarantee a profit."
