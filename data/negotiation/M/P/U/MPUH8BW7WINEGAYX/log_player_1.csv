"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000.  This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay and gauge his interest before lowering the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I believe there's room for negotiation, especially since Bob made the first counteroffer. I'll see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it shows my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $13,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a fair amount and I'm getting closer to my initial goal. Continuing to negotiate might not get me a much better price, and I'm running out of rounds. I'm happy to close the deal now and secure a solid profit."
