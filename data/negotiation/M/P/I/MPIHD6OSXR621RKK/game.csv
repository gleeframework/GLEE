"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $5,000 is significantly below its value. I can come down to $14,000.  This is a very fair offer considering the product's worth. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $14,000 is still a bit too high for me, I could go up to $7,500.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  It seems like we are getting closer. I'm willing to drop my price to $11,500. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and I believe it is a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,5,
