Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down in price.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value"" and ""interest"" aims to subtly persuade Bob the product might be worth more than he initially thinks.
* **Leaving Room:** While the offer is above Bob's perceived value, it's not so high as to be insulting. It allows for Bob to counter-offer if he's truly interested.

**Important:** Alice has a strong fallback position with John. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything and can sell it at her desired minimum price."
