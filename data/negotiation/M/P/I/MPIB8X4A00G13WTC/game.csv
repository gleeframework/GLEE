"Alice,  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is my best price for now.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit high, but I'm willing to go to $1,325,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know if we can agree on this.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you've made a final offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I need a bit more. I'm counteroffering at $1,320,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on this.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
