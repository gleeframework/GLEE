"Alice,  $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you closer to your budget. How about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product.  Let's find a middle ground. What if we settled on $13,000? That's a significant price drop and a fair deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy you're willing to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm only able to go up to $11,000. I really want this product, so let's see if we can find a solution.",11000.0,Bob,6,
