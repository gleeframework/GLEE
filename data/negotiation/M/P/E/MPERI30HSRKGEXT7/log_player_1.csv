Round 2

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Bob has steadily increased his offer and is now at $11,000.  Accepting this offer gives us a profit of $3,000 over our minimum acceptable price. 

Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of:

* **Bob lowering his offer:** He might be getting impatient.
* **Not reaching a deal:** We only have a few rounds left and might miss out on both Bob and John's offers.

It's better to secure a solid profit now than risk losing everything."
