Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $11,000. This is likely to be rejected by Bob, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards and still make a profit.  I know the product is worth $10,000 to John, so I'm confident I can secure that price if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, I can still potentially do better.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise - it's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, so it's the best option."
