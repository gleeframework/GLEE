"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too steep for me. While I recognize the product's value, I'm only willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits it holds for your business.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This price reflects the product's value to me while also allowing you to make a profit.  I believe this is a fair compromise and a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
