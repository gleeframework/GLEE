"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000.

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. After reviewing my options, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $10000. Can you consider a counteroffer of $9800? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
