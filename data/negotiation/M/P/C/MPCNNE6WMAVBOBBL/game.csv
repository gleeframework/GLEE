"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me while also giving you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  It's still a great price for you, and a fair price for me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows both of us to make a good deal.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's settle on $1,087,500.  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to move forward with the deal.",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,087,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,080,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but it shows my commitment to reaching a deal.  Let's make this happen.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
