{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $100 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $150 by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm lowering my price to $140.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise to close the deal with Bob."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $120 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm dropping my price to $130.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still hoping to secure a price above my minimum."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $125 is still a bit lower than what I ideally want, it's above my minimum threshold and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, I might end up losing out on this deal altogether. I'm willing to take the $125 and close the deal with Bob."
