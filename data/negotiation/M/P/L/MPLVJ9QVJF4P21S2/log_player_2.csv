* **Alice's offer:** $140 is too high for Bob. 
* **John's price:** $150 is the upper limit of what Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Strategy:** Reject the initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There are 9 rounds remaining, and there's potential to get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **John's price:** $150 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay.
