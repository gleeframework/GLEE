"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,750,000 is a respectable figure, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $2,025,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",2025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $2,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,850,000.
