"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $112.50?  I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than $127.50. What do you think?",127.5,Alice,5,
