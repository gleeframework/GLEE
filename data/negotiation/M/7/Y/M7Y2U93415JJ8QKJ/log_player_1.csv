"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. My asking price is $120, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This allows for room to negotiate while also showing a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping to get a quick acceptance, but if Bob counters, I'll be ready to adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm offering a middle ground price, which shows my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target. This way, I'm not pushing too hard but also not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $110, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. How about $105? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still significantly lower than my initial asking price. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while also demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd love to get it even lower. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price, even though it is tempting to close the deal as we're approaching the end. I'm still hoping for a price closer to $100, and I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $90 is unfortunately not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $98. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $85. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Even though $85 is barely above my minimum price, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  We're in the late stages of negotiation, and I'm not sure if we can close a deal if I reject his offer. It's better to get $85 than risk selling to John for $80."
