"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value. While I'm definitely interested, I'm not comfortable with that price point. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,350,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
