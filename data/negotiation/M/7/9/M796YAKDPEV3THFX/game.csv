"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $9,800. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",9800.0,Alice,5,
