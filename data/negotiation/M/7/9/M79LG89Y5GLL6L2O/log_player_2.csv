"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I'm looking for $900000 for it. If you're interested, please let me know and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room to lower the price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm offering it to you for $775000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000

While $775,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high.  There's still room for negotiation and the potential to get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $775,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $712,500? This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 712500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $725000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm thinking we're getting close, though. Let's see if we can make it work at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  $725,000 is a good deal considering you can get it from John for $1,500,000.  It's likely that further negotiation won't yield much more savings."
