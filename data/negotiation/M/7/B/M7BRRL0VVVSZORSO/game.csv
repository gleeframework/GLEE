"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $11,000, which is a significant discount from the original price, but still a fair price for the value this product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I can do $11,500, which is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  I'm willing to move up a bit to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the same price I initially offered, but I'm willing to consider it one last time. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,

"This is getting frustrating, Alice.  My last offer is $10,500.  Take it or leave it.",10500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're getting frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is a significant compromise from my initial price. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Alice,9,
