Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I think I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm willing to give Bob a little more room, but I'm not going to accept anything below $9,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would still be a fantastic deal for you considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9000. This is the highest I can go, considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get a bit more, $9,000 is a good price, and it's getting late in the game. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
