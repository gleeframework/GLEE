"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $10,750.  This is a fair price that is closer to your valuation and still saves me money compared to buying from John. Let me know your thoughts.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $11,050. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",11050.0,Alice,5,
