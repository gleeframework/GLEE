"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the value this product offers.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $950,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could go up to $700,000.  Do you think that would work?",700000.0,Bob,4,
