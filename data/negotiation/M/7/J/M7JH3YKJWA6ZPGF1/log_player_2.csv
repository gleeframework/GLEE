"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible. Since John is willing to sell for $100, you should reject Alice's initial offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $110 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're still trying to get the best price, and $105 is only $5 less than what John is selling it for. You should reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll take it for $100. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can give you a deal for $102.50. It's a great price, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

You've already reached the point where you're only saving $2.50 by negotiating with Alice, and you've already rejected her counteroffer. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice, especially since you know you can buy the product from John for $100."
