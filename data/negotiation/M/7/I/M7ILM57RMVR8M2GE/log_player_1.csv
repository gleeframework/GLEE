Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $175 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle the price down, and you can meet somewhere in the middle, still making more than your minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses a confident tone (""great deal"") to subtly influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $150, he doesn't know you have another buyer.  A significantly higher offer might make him walk away.
* **One Chance:** This is a one-shot negotiation. If Bob rejects your offer, you go with your guaranteed sale to John."
