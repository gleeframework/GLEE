"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth considering an offer that reflects its true worth. For this exceptional opportunity, I propose a price of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first.  Alice's starting offer is quite high, leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree your product is excellent, the price point is a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $650,000."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:**  Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer  ($650,000) creates room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message acknowledges the product's value while clearly stating the price is a sticking point. 
* **Strategic Aim:** This counter-offer aims to steer the negotiation closer to the  $800,000 mark that I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your feedback. To better align with your budget while still reflecting the value of our product, I would like to propose a revised price of $750,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to our desired price range, which is encouraging. However, $750,000 is still above our ideal price point.  We have room to negotiate further, especially since we have the backup option of buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can go a bit higher, how about $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  By countering with $700,000, we show Alice we're willing to move up, but in smaller increments. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  We're still a fair bit below her offer, keeping the pressure on her to continue moving towards our target.
* **Time Consideration:** As we progress through the rounds,  it becomes more tempting to take John's offer. This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving while giving Alice a chance to sweeten the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I am glad we are finding common ground here. Considering the value you place on our product, I would like to propose a final price of $725,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Price:** $725,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's below our $800,000 limit and a significant savings from Alice's initial offer. 
* **""Final Price"" Signal:**  Alice using the phrase ""final price"" suggests she might not be willing to go much lower.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate might not yield much more, and there's always the risk that Alice won't budge further. Accepting now secures a good deal."
