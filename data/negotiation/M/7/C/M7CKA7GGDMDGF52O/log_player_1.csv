Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me.  
* **Potential Upsell:** I'm aiming for a higher price, hoping Bob values the product more than $10,000. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John. This offer gives me a chance to make a profit, but it's not overly risky.

This is a starting point. I may adjust the price based on Bob's reaction or any information I learn about his potential valuation."
