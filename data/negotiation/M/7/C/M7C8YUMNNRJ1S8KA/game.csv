"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's the maximum I can afford at this time. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to be able to recoup a significant portion of the product's value. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to recoup some of the product's value, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
