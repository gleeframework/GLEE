"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering our costs and market value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price that I believe is fair for both parties.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider coming down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value and our costs.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $775,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being reasonable for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $775,000 is still a bit below our minimum price, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
