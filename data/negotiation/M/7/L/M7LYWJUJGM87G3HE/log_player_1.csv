Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer $11,400 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. Can you consider my offer?

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is consistently coming up, and we're now at a point where the difference between his offer ($11,400) and my guaranteed sale to John ($10,000) is significant.  It's better to take the sure profit now than risk him walking away in later rounds."
