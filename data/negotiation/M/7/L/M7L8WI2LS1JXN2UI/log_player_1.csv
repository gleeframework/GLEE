{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price around $120 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($150 - $80 = $70) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain.

**Strategy:**

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where Bob is likely to see value but also leaves you room to potentially negotiate down slightly if needed, without going below your minimum."
