"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there.  How about $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $115. I'm willing to come down to $130, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to buy from John.",120.0,Bob,6,
