This offer is a strong starting point for negotiation. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but it still leaves room for Bob to negotiate down. This approach aims to maximize your potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent sum, it's still below my desired range. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I can make a counteroffer."

This counteroffer is a compromise, acknowledging that Bob is willing to pay a bit more than his initial offer, but still ensuring I get closer to my desired price. It should encourage Bob to continue the negotiation and hopefully reach a mutually acceptable price."
