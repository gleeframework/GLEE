(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $9,500. There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $8,000. Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, showing willingness to negotiate while still leaving some room for compromise.  This is also a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is actually higher than her first offer. This could indicate that she's not very willing to lower the price.  However, it's still better than buying from John.  There are still 7 rounds left to negotiate. It's worth seeing if we can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing signs of being unwilling to lower the price significantly. However, we're still under the $9,000 mark that she initially offered.  Increasing our offer slightly to $8,750 shows that we're willing to meet her halfway, but still trying to achieve a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is continuing to increase her offer, which is frustrating. However, we're still closer to her valuation than John's price.  We have 5 rounds left, and there's still potential for negotiation. It's worth holding out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to push the price higher, but we're still under her initial offer.  This counteroffer shows that we're willing to compromise, but are not willing to pay an inflated price. It's a significant increase from our previous offer, but still a better deal than John's price. We're halfway through the rounds, so it's time to start making a more serious push towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very persistent in raising the price, but we're getting close to a potential deal. We have 3 rounds left, and we're still under the $10,000 mark, which is significantly better than buying from John. It's worth trying to reach a compromise in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but we're still getting a better deal. This counteroffer represents a significant increase from our previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  We only have 2 rounds left, so we need to show Alice that we're serious about making a deal. This offer leaves room for a final counteroffer, but it's still significantly lower than John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round, and Alice is still stubbornly refusing to budge.  While $9,900 is a better deal than John's price, we've already gone through a lot of back and forth. At this point, it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting our final counteroffer and leaving us with no deal.  It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
