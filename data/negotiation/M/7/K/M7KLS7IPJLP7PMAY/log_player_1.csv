{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but it still gives me a decent profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I can gauge his interest and potentially lower the price slightly in a counteroffer.  Remember, I always have the option to sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my ideal. It's possible that Bob will ultimately accept a price closer to $115, and even if he doesn't, I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $105 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about we settle on $110? That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105 again? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to make sure I can afford it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm on his $105 offer, and while it's better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I'm comfortable with. I've already made two counteroffers, and it seems unlikely that he will budge.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120.  I'm guaranteed a profit and I can avoid further negotiation that might drag on."
