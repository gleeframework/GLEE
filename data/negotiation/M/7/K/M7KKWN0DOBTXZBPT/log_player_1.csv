Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm confident could significantly benefit your business.  I'm offering it to you for a price of $1,150,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering the product for $1,150,000. This is a price that is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), making it attractive to him. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the product's value and highlights the potential benefits for Bob. It also leaves the door open for further discussion and negotiation.

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  $1,150,000 is a considerable amount more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Increase the likelihood of Bob accepting:**  Offering a price below Bob's perceived value creates a strong incentive for him to buy.

This is just one possible offer. Depending on how you want to play the game, you can adjust the price and message to be more or less aggressive."
