"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm confident could significantly benefit your business.  I'm offering it to you for a price of $1,150,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. Since John is your fallback option at $1,200,000, you have some room to negotiate with Alice or see if she'll lower her price in a counter-offer."
