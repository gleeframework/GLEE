"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $95 is too close to your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. It's likely she'll counter, but it establishes your desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my ideal price.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it's still within a reasonable range for both of us.  I'm willing to move slightly closer to Alice's offer, but I still want to secure a good deal."
