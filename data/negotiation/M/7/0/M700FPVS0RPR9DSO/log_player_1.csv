Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you first. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible while still exceeding John's offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving us a chance to still secure a price above John's offer.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the high price without revealing our bottom line. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a premium price and ensuring we don't lose the guaranteed sale to John."
