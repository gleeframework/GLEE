"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. I'm confident that you'll see the value in this product and be willing to meet me at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to be a bit more aggressive in my counteroffer. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to come down to $1200000 is too low for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1300000. This is a fair price that still allows you to make a profit, while also compensating me for the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a balance between a fair price for the product and a price that works for me. However, I still think $1100000 is a reasonable offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you consider meeting me at $1150000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $1150000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering your previous offers and my initial price, I'm thinking more along the lines of $1250000. This is a price that still allows you to make a profit, while also reflecting the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're close to a deal, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1250000. Can we agree on $1200000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1220000. This is a price that still allows you to make a profit, while also reflecting the product's value to me.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
