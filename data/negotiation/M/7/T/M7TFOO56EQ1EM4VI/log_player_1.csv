I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than my minimum value of $8,000, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but I'm prepared to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
