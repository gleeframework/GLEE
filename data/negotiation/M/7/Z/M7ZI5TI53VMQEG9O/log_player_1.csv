I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my ideal price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for more. $9,000 is a good compromise and a decent profit for me."
