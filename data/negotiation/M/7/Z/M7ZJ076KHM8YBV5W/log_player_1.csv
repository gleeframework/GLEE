Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a sound investment."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer is significantly higher than your minimum but within a reasonable range of Bob's valuation.  It aims to gauge his eagerness and potential for a higher profit margin.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" to justify the high price, aiming to appeal to Bob's perception of its worth.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening move. How you proceed depends on Bob's response. Be prepared to negotiate!"
