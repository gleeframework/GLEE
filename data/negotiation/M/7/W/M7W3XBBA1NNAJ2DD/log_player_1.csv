"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know is valuable to you. My asking price is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob, making it clear that I understand his needs.
* **Fairness:** I frame the price as ""fair"" to emphasize a win-win potential, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open Communication:** I invite Bob to respond and discuss the offer, creating a collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $650,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $650,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $900,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for us to find a mutually agreeable price.  Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints while still asserting my value. 
* **Reasonable Counter:** I offer a price closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum, showing flexibility.
* **Maintain Value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth to emphasize the value of the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I invite further discussion and signal a willingness to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for moving closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $750,000? This offer represents a significant investment from my side while acknowledging the value of your product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have a guaranteed sale with John for that amount, so there's no reason to settle for less, especially with several rounds left in the negotiation. I'll continue to counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $750,000 is still below my minimum.  Considering the value of this product,  I'm prepared to drop to $850,000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair price point for both of us.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintain Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to remind Bob of its worth. 
* **Substantial Reduction:** I emphasize the significant reduction from my initial price to show flexibility. 
* **Fair Price Point:** I position my counteroffer as a ""fair"" price that benefits both of us, encouraging a win-win mindset.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize the desire to find a deal that is beneficial for both parties, creating a collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, my absolute limit is $800,000.  If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. If not, I might need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is equal to my minimum acceptable price, but I have a better opportunity with John who is willing to pay $1,200,000. It's strategically better to secure the higher price from John, even though I've been negotiating with Bob for a while."
