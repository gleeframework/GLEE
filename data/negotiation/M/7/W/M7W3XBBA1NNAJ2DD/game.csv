"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $650,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $650,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $900,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for us to find a mutually agreeable price.  Let's keep talking.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for moving closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $750,000? This offer represents a significant investment from my side while acknowledging the value of your product. What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $750,000 is still below my minimum.  Considering the value of this product,  I'm prepared to drop to $850,000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair price point for both of us.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close!  I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, my absolute limit is $800,000.  If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. If not, I might need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
