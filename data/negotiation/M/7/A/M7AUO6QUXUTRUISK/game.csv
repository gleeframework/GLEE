"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I respect your position, I still feel that $850,000 is beyond my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $825,000? This would allow me to make a fair purchase while staying within my financial limits.",825000.0,Bob,4,
