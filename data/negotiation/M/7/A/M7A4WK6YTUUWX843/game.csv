"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price.  How about $8,500?  That's a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while.",8500.0,Alice,3,
