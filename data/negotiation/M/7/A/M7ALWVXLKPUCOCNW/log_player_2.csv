"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value, I'm starting negotiations at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the potential benefits it offers you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always best to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since you have 10 rounds. You can likely get a better deal than $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still a bit higher than your ideal price point, but you're getting closer.  You can likely negotiate even lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product, but I'm still a bit higher than my ideal price.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,100,000? I think this is a fair price considering the potential benefits for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
