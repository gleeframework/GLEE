"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand its worth to you may be different than it is to me, but I'm confident that it's a strong investment. My asking price is $1000000.  Consider this: if you decline, I have another buyer lined up ready to pay $800000. So, this is truly a chance for you to secure a significant advantage. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
