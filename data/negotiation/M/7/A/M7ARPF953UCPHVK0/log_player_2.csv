"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand its worth to you may be different than it is to me, but I'm confident that it's a strong investment. My asking price is $1000000.  Consider this: if you decline, I have another buyer lined up ready to pay $800000. So, this is truly a chance for you to secure a significant advantage. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Even if you reject Alice's offer and buy from John, you'll pay $200,000 more.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best financial decision, allowing you to save money."
