"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $175?",175.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $175. How about we meet in the middle at $180? I'm confident you'll love the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go down to $170?",170.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. How about we meet at $185? I'm willing to come down from $200, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $150.",185.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $175?",175.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already offered $175 once before, and I'm not willing to go back to that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $175 and $185, which would be $180. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",180.0,Alice,7,
