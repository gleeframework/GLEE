"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to offer you $110 for the product, as that's my maximum budget. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $110. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $130. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm happy to pay $120, which is a good price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm going to make a final offer of $125, which I think is a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",125.0,Alice,5,
