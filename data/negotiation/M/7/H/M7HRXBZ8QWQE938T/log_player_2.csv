"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is closer to his target, he can still potentially get a better deal. He can make a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to go lower.  If not, he can buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still not quite there.  $9,000 is the absolute highest I can go at this point.  If you're willing to accept that, we can make a deal. "", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is your maximum, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is determined to save as much money as possible, and he's already offered his maximum price. Alice is unlikely to drop any further, making it more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John at $8,000. This ensures Bob achieves his goal of getting the product for the lowest possible price."
