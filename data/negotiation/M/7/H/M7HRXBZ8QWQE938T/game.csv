"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still not quite there.  $9,000 is the absolute highest I can go at this point.  If you're willing to accept that, we can make a deal. ",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is your maximum, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9200.0,Alice,5,
