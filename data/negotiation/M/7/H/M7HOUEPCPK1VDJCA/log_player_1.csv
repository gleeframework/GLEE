Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the pace of the negotiation suggests it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly closer to your $1,000,000 valuation. You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired price.  It makes the most business sense to take the guaranteed profit now rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
