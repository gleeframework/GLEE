Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. Aiming for $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Scarcity tactic:** Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to accept your offer quickly.
* **Value emphasis:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, the message highlights the ""value and potential"" of the product, reinforcing its worth in Bob's mind. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your minimum acceptable price is $1,200,001 to ensure a profit over John's offer."
