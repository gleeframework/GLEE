"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $13,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that still allows you to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
