Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum value and hopefully closer to a range where Bob might be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable value. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price.  Accepting this offer ensures I get my minimum desired value and doesn't risk further negotiation with Bob potentially lowering the price even further."
