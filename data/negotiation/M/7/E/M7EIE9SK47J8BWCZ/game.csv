"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, my budget is capped at $10,000. I'm willing to pay that amount right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $10,000.  If we can't reach an agreement at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value and my costs. I think it's a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",10800.0,Alice,5,
