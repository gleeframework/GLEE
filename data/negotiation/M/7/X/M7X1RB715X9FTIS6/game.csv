"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me. How about $135?  It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great value for the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $135. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? I'm willing to meet you halfway.,125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. Would you be willing to pay $130? It's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. Would you be willing to meet me at $125 again? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $125 is still below what I need to sell for.  Let's try $128. It's a small step towards meeting your needs, and a good value for a product like this.",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not getting any closer to your target price, Alice. I'm willing to make one more offer. Would you be willing to meet me at $123? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",123.0,Bob,8,
