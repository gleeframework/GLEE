"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $900,000.
