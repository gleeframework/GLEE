Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you'll receive from selling it."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $850,000, but I'm not sure I'm willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product and the value I place on it. What do you think?

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not ready to accept $950,000. Considering we're getting close to my minimum price, I'm willing to make a more significant concession. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal with you. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a deal, but I'm not comfortable going below $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?
