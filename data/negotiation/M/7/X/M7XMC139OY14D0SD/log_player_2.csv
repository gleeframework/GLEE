"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $100 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $110.  While getting the product for $110 is a decent deal, your goal is to save as much as possible. John offers a guaranteed price of $100, which is better than Alice's current offer."
