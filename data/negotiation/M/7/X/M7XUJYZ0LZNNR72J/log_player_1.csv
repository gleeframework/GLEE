"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500.  I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high to maximize potential profit, knowing Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $11,500 offer leaves space for negotiation while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware of John's offer ($10,000), which serves as my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price and what I know the product is worth to him. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a loss.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?"", ""product_price"": 10750}

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** I'm lowering my price to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Aiming Higher:**  While closer to my minimum, $10,750 still leaves some room for negotiation while securing a profit above John's offer. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  I don't want to drop the price too drastically and undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,200. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and this price feels more comfortable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,200 isn't ideal, it's still a profit above my absolute minimum ($10,000 from John). Continuing to negotiate might push Bob away, risking a better deal. It's time to secure the profit and close the deal."
