"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $14,000 to start. Given its worth, I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000. This feels like a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your perspective on the price.  While $12,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product sits closer to my initial price.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible.  While $13,000 is better than John's $15,000,  and a better price than the previous round, there is still room for negotiation to get closer to Bob's desired price.  There's a chance Alice will be willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm happy to split the difference and pay $12,500.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
