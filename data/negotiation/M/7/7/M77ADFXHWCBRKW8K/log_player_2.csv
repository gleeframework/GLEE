"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000. You can get the product for $15,000 from John, so it makes the most sense to buy it from him and save the extra money."
