{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. It leaves room for negotiation, but I'm still in a good position. If Bob rejects, I can either counter or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm interested in selling to him, I need to hold out for a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer, but still below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply not feasible for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a price that I can work with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum. While I could counter, it's becoming clear that getting a price I'm truly happy with might be difficult.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to John. I'm guaranteed a much better price with him."
