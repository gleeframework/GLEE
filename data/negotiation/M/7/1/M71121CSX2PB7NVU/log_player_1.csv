Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly lower than my minimum value ($150). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price allows for negotiation, while still ensuring I make a decent profit. 
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. 

This strategy aims to initiate negotiations while keeping the door open to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $100. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum value:**  While it's closer to my minimum, $100 is still below the $150 I need to make a worthwhile sale. 
* **There's room for further negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can push for a higher price. 
* **John is a backup:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, so I can afford to hold out for a better price, knowing John is a reliable alternative. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a good price for the value you'll be getting."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($100). 
* **Emphasizing value:** I reiterate the value of the product and the fairness of my offer. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** While $120 is closer to my minimum, I'm still open to a little more negotiation if Bob is still hesitant. 

This strategy aims to find a compromise that benefits both of us while still allowing me to meet my minimum profit requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $110? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures I get my desired $150, eliminating the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price.
* **No significant incentive to negotiate:**  While I could try another counteroffer with Bob, there's no guarantee he'll accept, and the risk of a lower price isn't worth the potential gain.

Therefore, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John and secure my minimum profit."
