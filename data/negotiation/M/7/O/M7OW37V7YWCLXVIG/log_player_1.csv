Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, which allows for further negotiation. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own. If I don't feel like negotiating further, I can always sell the product to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible.** Bob is interested in the product and has shown willingness to negotiate. 
* **Counteroffer is likely to succeed.** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially reach a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price.

**Next steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I will continue to negotiate with Bob until I reach a price that is acceptable to both of us, or I decide to sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny, and I'm really interested in making this deal work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and makes it more likely that Bob will accept.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob to reinforce his interest in purchasing it.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to foster a productive negotiation.

**Next steps:**

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will assess his next offer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own. I will continue to negotiate with Bob until I reach a price that is acceptable to both of us or I decide to sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we go with $11,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I don't want to overpay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While he's shown some flexibility, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $15,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to get me closer to my goal.**  While Bob seems interested, he's shown he's unwilling to go higher than $11,500. 
* **Selling to John guarantees my desired profit.**  Selling the product to John for $15,000 guarantees my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

I will sell the product to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
