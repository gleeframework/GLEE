{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you!  I'm asking $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm aiming for a price above my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm also making a friendly opening to encourage a positive conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
