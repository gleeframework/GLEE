"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$400,000 is a great price, but it's still early in the negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower, especially since you haven't even made a counteroffer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows my serious intent to negotiate and establishes a lower price range.  While it's unlikely she'll accept this immediately, it forces her to consider a lower price and sets the stage for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my initial counteroffer, but it's still lower than her first price. I'm still in a good position to negotiate further. There's no need to accept her offer yet, and I can likely get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith and demonstrate my willingness to compromise.  $350,000 is a reasonable midpoint between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This should encourage Alice to reconsider and hopefully lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. We are halfway through the negotiation process, and I believe I can still secure a lower price. By rejecting the offer, I can continue exploring a better deal and see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, but it's still slightly above my comfort zone. I'm increasing my offer to $400,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not ready to accept her price just yet.  It's a strategic move that could potentially lead to a successful deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now significantly higher than my target price.  We are approaching the end of the negotiation, and while I could continue to bargain, the likelihood of reaching a satisfactory price within the remaining rounds is low. Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget, avoiding further negotiation risks and potential for a worse outcome."
