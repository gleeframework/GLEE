Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a comfortable price, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a bit more flexibility from you. I can offer you the product for $1200000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If you're still not comfortable with this, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000. I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point where I need to consider other options. I'm willing to make one last offer: I'll sell the product to you for $1200000, but this is my final price. If you're not willing to meet me at this point, I'll have to explore other opportunities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that she's not willing to go lower than $1,200,000. While I'm still hoping for a better deal, I only have one round left. Given that John is willing to sell me the product for $1,500,000, it's more advantageous for me to buy from him. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids potentially losing out if Alice changes her mind in the last round."
