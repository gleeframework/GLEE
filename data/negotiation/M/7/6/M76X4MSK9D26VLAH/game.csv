"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1200000 is a bit out of my range. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1050000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1300000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1300000. I'm still a little outside my comfort zone at that price.  Let's split the difference. How about $1150000? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1150000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you the product for $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably commit to.  I'm prepared to offer $1100000. Let's try to close this deal. This offer is my final one.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a comfortable price, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a bit more flexibility from you. I can offer you the product for $1200000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If you're still not comfortable with this, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $1150000.  This would be my final offer, and I believe it is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000. I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point where I need to consider other options. I'm willing to make one last offer: I'll sell the product to you for $1200000, but this is my final price. If you're not willing to meet me at this point, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
