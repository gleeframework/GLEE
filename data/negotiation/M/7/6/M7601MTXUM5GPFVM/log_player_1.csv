{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I've started with a price higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation.  By mentioning that I'm open to negotiation, I signal to Bob that a deal is possible without lowering my initial offer too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I'd rather sell to him than to John."
