"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer and how much I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to sell for that amount.  I will counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. I'll accept his offer."
