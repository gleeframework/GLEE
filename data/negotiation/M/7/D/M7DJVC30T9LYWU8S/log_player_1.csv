{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, hoping to maximize profit.  It also includes a friendly message to establish a rapport with Bob.  We'll see how he responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is a decent price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to see if I can push for a bit closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $95? I'm willing to compromise to make this work."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $92.50 is a good compromise. It's only $2.50 below my initial counteroffer and closer to my desired price than John's offer. It's worth accepting to secure the sale."
