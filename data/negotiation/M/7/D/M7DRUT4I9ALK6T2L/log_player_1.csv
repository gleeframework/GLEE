Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a competitive offer considering its true worth and the substantial benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but she also needs to incentivize Bob to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's higher than that but lower than her guaranteed sale to John.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to counter-offer.  
* **Confident Language:** The message uses confident language to emphasize the product's value, aiming to subtly influence Bob's perception.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, Alice increases her chances of securing a price closer to her desired outcome while still ensuring a sale."
