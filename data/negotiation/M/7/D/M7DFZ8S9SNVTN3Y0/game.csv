"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
