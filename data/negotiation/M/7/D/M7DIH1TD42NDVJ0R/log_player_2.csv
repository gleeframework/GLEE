"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value of your business. Given its high quality and unique features, it's valued at $15,000 to me. Considering its worth to you, I am offering it to you for $12,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It's in your best interest to see if Alice will come down further or proceed with buying from John."
