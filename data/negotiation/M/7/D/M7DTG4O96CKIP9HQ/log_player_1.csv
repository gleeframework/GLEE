Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000,  it's worth trying to get more from Bob. 
* **High but Reasonable:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but the ""exclusive opportunity"" framing and the knowledge of other buyers might persuade him.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""one-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, pushing Bob to decide quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still securing a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
