Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like your thinking, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,250 and $11,625, which is $11,937.50. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,937.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly demonstrating a willingness to meet in the middle and is unlikely to go much lower than $11,937.50. This price is a significant saving compared to John's offer and keeps me well within my $15,000 budget."
