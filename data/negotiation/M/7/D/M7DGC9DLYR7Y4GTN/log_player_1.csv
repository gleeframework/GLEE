Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer you could make as Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I know its value is significant to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let me know if you'd like to discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have leverage to start with a price significantly above that.  
* **Room for negotiation:** The $950,000 offer gives Bob room to negotiate down while still keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob aims to justify the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one potential strategy.  Negotiation is complex, and factors like your relationship with Bob, your negotiation style, and your risk tolerance might lead you to a different offer."
