"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's worth every penny. However, I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Could we settle somewhere around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, Alice.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is about the most I can justify spending on this product. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $1,000,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss a price of $1,080,000?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're getting close.  Would you be willing to settle this at $1,030,000?",1030000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but $1,030,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,080,000 and $1,030,000, so how about we discuss a price of $1,055,000?",1055000.0,Alice,7,
