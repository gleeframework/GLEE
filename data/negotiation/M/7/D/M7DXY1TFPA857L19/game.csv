"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1100000 for it. Can we discuss further?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. Can we meet at $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit above the halfway mark, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we meet at $1050000? It's a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm willing to consider it",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $980000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get at least $1080000 for it. Can we meet at that price?",1080000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not sure I can meet you at $1080000. I'm willing to go up to $990000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at that price?",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. $990000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not sure it's enough. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get at least $1100000 for it. If we can't meet at that price, I'll have to consider other options. Can we meet at $1000000?",1000000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $1000000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,10,
