"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $80.  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer of $90 allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is a fair compromise between our desired prices. This leaves room for Alice to still make a profit, while allowing me to save $5 compared to Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my initial goal of $85, but it's still not ideal. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $88. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but it's still a fair compromise that allows me to save $2 compared to her last offer.  I'm hoping she'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit. However, the negotiation seems to be getting more and more contentious, with no sign of reaching a compromise.  To avoid further time wasted and potential for escalating prices, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $100. This guarantees a purchase within my budget and avoids the risk of Alice continuing to raise her price."
