"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's meet halfway and close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,250. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
