"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm certainly interested in the product, but that price point is a bit too high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000? That feels like a fairer starting point for us to negotiate from.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to the table.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer the product for $775,000. This is my final compromise.",775000.0,Alice,5,
