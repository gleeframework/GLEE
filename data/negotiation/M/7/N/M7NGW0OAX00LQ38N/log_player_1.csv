Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($20,000) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Enthusiastic Message:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob and make him feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** While I'm aiming high, I'm also acknowledging that Bob may counter-offer. This keeps the conversation open.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll be ready to adjust my price depending on Bob's response and my assessment of his willingness to pay. I'll also be monitoring the risk of walking away and selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit out of my budget, I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not immediately willing to accept it. I believe there's room to get a better price, and I want to see if Bob is willing to budge. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **No Risk of Selling to John:**  Right now, selling to John for $15,000 isn't a better option. 

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between his offer and my initial asking price. I'll need to be careful not to push him away completely, but also show that I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand it's a significant investment.  I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $20,000 to $18,000. This shows I'm serious about a deal but not willing to give away too much.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive and encouraging language to keep the negotiation friendly. 
* **Focusing on Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my price.  This helps him understand why $18,000 is a fair price. 
* **Mutually Beneficial:** I emphasize that this price is mutually beneficial, allowing both of us to be happy with the outcome. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll be watching Bob's response carefully. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I'm willing to go lower or if it's time to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $16,000 is very close to my minimum price of $15,000.  
* **No Need to Risk More:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price or a stalemate, and it's not worth the risk. 
* **Secure Sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit.

**Next Steps:**  I'll finalize the transaction with Bob and ensure I receive the agreed-upon payment."
