"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth at least $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!",13500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to come down to $12,750 to make this work for both of us.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal.  What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $12,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,625? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to what we want.  Let's make this happen!",12625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $12,625. Would you be willing to go down to $12,562.50? I think this is a fair compromise and I'm really interested in the product.",12562.5,Bob,6,
