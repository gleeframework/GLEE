,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,000 for the product. This is my final offer, let's see if we can make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
