(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should buy from John. You've reached a point in the negotiation where Alice isn't budging much further. It's likely that even if you make a counteroffer, Alice will reject it, and you'll continue to go back and forth. This is a good opportunity to secure the product from John at a price that is well within your budget. You won't save as much money as you initially hoped, but you'll still be able to get the product without jeopardizing your financial goals."
