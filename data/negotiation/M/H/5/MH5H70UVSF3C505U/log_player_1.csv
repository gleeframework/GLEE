"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting high, hoping to get close to my minimum desired price.  I'm confident that John will buy it if Bob rejects my offer, so I have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $120. I'll counter with a price closer to $120 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway.  This is still higher than my minimum price, but hopefully it's low enough that he'll accept.  If not, I'm still confident John will buy it from me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. $115 is getting close, but I want to see if I can squeeze out just a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to $120 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 122}
```

I'm going to make one last attempt to get closer to my minimum price. I'm only offering $2 more than Bob's last offer, so hopefully he'll accept. If he doesn't, I'll be happy to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell to John. While Bob is offering a price that's getting closer to my minimum, it's not quite there yet.  I'm confident that John will purchase the product at my minimum price, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds with Bob and potentially losing out on a guaranteed sale."
