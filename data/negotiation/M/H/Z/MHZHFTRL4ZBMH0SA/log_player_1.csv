"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can't afford $9,500 for the product. I'm willing to pay up to $8,500. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,500 is above my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  Bob is clearly interested and I have 8 rounds to explore that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $9,000?  That would be a great price for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm still not able to go above $8,500. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful to get a higher price.  I have 6 rounds left to work with Bob, and we've established a pattern where he's willing to come up slightly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $8,900.  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

We're at round 6, and Bob has made it clear he's not willing to go higher than $8,750. I need to weigh the risks of continuing the negotiation:

* **Risk of continuing:**  If I reject, there's no guarantee he'll increase his offer further. I'm already above my minimum of $8,000, and with only 4 rounds left, the potential gains don't outweigh the risk of losing the deal. 
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob,  John offers a guaranteed $8,000. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale, and it's close enough to my minimum. It's time to close the deal."
