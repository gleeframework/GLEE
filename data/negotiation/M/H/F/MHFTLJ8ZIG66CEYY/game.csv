"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm open to negotiation, $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $1,650,000? This reflects a more reasonable compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
