"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $14,000?  I'm confident this product is worth that much to me, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $14,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth a bit more than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. While Alice is willing to meet halfway, the price is still too high.  Bob can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $16,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my willingness to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $15,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's likely that Alice won't come down any further.  To save time and avoid further haggling, it's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John for $15,000."
