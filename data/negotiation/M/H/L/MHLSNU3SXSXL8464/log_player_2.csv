# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is starting the negotiation at her product's full value to her.  While she might be willing to come down in price, it's very unlikely she'll go as low as John's offer.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is your maximum price, so you should take that deal."
