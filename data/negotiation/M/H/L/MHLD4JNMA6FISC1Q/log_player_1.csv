Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but I think it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a premium for the product, as it's worth more than $150 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'm not giving up on getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}

I'm offering $160.  This is still a bit higher than what Bob offered, but it's a compromise. I'm hoping he'll see that it's a fair price, considering my minimum acceptable price is $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum requirement.  Selling to John at $150 guarantees me a profit and avoids further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiations."
