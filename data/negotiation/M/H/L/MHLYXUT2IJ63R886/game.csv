"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that the initial price was a bit high, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I propose a price of $1,325,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,325,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  Would you consider $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,275,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a profit. I propose a price of $1,290,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
