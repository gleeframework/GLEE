"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
