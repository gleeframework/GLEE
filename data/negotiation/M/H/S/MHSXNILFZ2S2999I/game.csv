"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional item. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1800000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $1400000 is below my minimum expectation. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My revised offer is $1600000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1350000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, Bob. However, $1350000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. My next offer is $1550000. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm still open to negotiations. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
