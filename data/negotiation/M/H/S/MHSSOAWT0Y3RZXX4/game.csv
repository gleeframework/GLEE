"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $750,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $800,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that aligns with the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I've made a significant concession already, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a dedicated support package, which adds significant value to the product. I'm still firm at $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
