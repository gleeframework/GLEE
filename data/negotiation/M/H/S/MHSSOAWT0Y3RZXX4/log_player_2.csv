"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $750,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You have 7 rounds left, so there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $800,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that aligns with the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've made a significant concession already, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a dedicated support package, which adds significant value to the product. I'm still firm at $825,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering additional benefits like a warranty and support package, but the price remains above your budget. While these extras may be valuable, you've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely Alice will budge on the price. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's  riskier to continue negotiating and potentially miss out on the product altogether. 

Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price, even though you miss out on the added benefits. In this scenario,  certainty and budget are more important than the extras Alice offers."
