Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a good profit, but also want to leave room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  $20,000 is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it's still potentially attractive to Bob. 

Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's low offer, I'm not ready to sell for that price just yet. I believe there's still potential to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's lowball price.  Hopefully, this shows good faith and encourages Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is really pushing down the price, and I'm not sure we'll be able to find a compromise that works for both of us.  At this point, it's best to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000. While I'm not thrilled with this outcome, it's better than risking a continued negotiation with Bob that could result in an even lower price."
