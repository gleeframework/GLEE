"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $119 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply proceed to buy from John and save a dollar."
