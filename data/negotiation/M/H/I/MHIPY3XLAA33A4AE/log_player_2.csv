"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's much better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price or purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget, $8,000. This is a bold move, but it signals to Alice that I'm serious about getting the product at a fair price. If she rejects this, I can still buy from John, so there's no risk on my end."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000. I will continue to negotiate with Alice in hopes of reaching a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $10,000, which is still significantly lower than Alice's price of $16,000 but represents a compromise. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still staying within a reasonable price range for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my budget.  At this point, I've already spent some time negotiating with Alice, and it's clear she's not willing to drop the price to a point where I'm comfortable. Buying from John guarantees I get the product for my maximum budget. I'm willing to cut my losses and move on to a more straightforward transaction with John."
