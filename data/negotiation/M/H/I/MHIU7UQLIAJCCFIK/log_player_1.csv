I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value, but hopefully still attractive to Bob. I'll see if he bites, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$80 is far too low for me.  I'm rejecting his offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to stick to my minimum price of $120.  This is still a good deal for Bob, and it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. Hopefully, he'll see that and come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round. I'm hoping that Bob will eventually realize my true value for the product and come closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to lower my price a little to $110. I want to be reasonable, but I'm still not willing to go much lower than this.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and finally agree to buy the product."
