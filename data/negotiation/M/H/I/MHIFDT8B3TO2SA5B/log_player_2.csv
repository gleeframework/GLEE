"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less than $10,000. There's no reason to accept this offer when he can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so he offers a price closer to that value, hoping to find a middle ground.  $9,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he still believes he can get it for less. There's no guarantee Alice won't come down further, and he has several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of incremental offers. He's raised his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise but still pushing for a better price.  This keeps the negotiation moving and shows Alice he's serious about getting a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he might be able to squeeze out a bit more, he's already gotten a significant discount from his initial target price.  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
