"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but her offer is at $1,000,000.  
* There's room for negotiation, so it makes sense to reject and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about $950,000? That's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. Let's keep the negotiations moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.
* There's still room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
