**Reasoning:** 

Bob seems firmly anchored at $1,050,000 and is only incrementally increasing his offers. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the significant gap between his valuation and your minimum acceptable price.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, which is a much better outcome than continuing to haggle with Bob."
