"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that reflects its exceptional worth. While I value it at $1,200,000, I'm willing to negotiate a fair price that benefits us both.  Let's discuss a mutually agreeable figure that reflects its true value.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly what Bob values the product at. There's no room for negotiation to save money.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for the same price, rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy. This sets the stage for potential negotiation with Alice later, or potentially finding a better deal from another seller."
