Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I aim to get as much as possible from Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Confident Approach:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and opportunity, to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation strategy. If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
