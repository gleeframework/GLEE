Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you'd accept $100 from John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $95 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a bit high. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($80), giving you leverage in potential negotiations. 

By starting at $95, you're in a strong position to potentially secure a higher profit than your guaranteed $100 from John."
