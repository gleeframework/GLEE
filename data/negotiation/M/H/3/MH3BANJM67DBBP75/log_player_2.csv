"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you halfway at $11,000, which is a compromise that still benefits both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I can do $10,500, which is still a great deal for you, and it's a bit closer to my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Explanation:  At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,500. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $10,000, it makes more sense to take that deal and avoid further haggling."
