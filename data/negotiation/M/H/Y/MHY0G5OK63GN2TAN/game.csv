"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,750. It's a fair compromise, and it's the most I can afford. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",10750.0,Bob,4,

I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.
