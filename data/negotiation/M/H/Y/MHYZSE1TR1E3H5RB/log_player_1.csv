I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This is to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round based on his response."

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still staying above my minimum value. This shows flexibility while keeping the price at a level I'm comfortable with."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but I've gone through several rounds and it seems he's not willing to go higher. It's getting late in the game, and I'm confident I can get my minimum value from John. Selling to John is the best option to guarantee my minimum earnings."
