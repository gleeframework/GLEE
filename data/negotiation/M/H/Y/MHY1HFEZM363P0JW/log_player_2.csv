"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to say if $60 is a good deal. Let's see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is serious about selling. $45 is a significant discount from her initial offer, and I'm hoping she'll be willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, but I'm still not convinced $55 is a great deal.  I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

I'm bumping my offer up a bit, showing I'm serious about buying but still leaving room for negotiation. $50 seems like a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $52. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $52
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my desired price. At this point, it's more likely that she'll continue to come down incrementally rather than offering a much lower price.  I'm comfortable accepting $52, especially considering John's price of $150."
