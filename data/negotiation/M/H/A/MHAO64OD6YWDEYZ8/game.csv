"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential for success. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, considering its value and my own limitations.  Let me know if this works for you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. While I value the product highly, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to accept $825,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $825,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  I believe this is a fair price considering both of our positions. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
