"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in your product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it, considering its value to me.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm unable to match that price. How about we meet in the middle at $85? This still allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $80?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
