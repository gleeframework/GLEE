Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to save as much as I can. Can you meet me at $85?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to save, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $87.50 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $88.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but $88.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $86.25. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86.25

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again. While $86.25 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $87, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $86.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

At this point, with only two rounds left and Bob offering only a slight increase to $86.50, it's no longer worth it to continue negotiating with him. Selling to John for $80 guarantees me a sale and a profit, even though it's a bit lower than my preferred price."
