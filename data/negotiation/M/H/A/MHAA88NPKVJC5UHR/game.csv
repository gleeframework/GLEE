"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to save as much as I can. Can you meet me at $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to save, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $87.50. Can you consider that?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $87.50 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $88.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",88.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but $88.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $86.25. Can you consider that?",86.25,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you at $87.  Let's make this deal happen.  I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",87.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $87, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $86.50. Can you consider that?",86.5,Bob,8,
