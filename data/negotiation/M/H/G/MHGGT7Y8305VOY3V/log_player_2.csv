"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing its value to me. However,  $12,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to my target:**  $11,500 is significantly better than John's price of $15,000, and it's only $500 more than my initial counteroffer.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  While I could counter again, there's no guarantee Alice will lower her price further.  
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price but could also drag out the process. It's worth taking the deal while it's within a reasonable range."
