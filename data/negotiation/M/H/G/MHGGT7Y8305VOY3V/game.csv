"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing its value to me. However,  $12,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
