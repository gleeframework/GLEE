"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,000 is closer, but still a stretch for my budget. How about $7,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
