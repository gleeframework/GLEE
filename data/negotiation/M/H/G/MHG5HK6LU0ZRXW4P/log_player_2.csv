Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still believe this product is worth more than $800000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my preferred price point and is well within my budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer or me needing to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price.  I'm going to accept Alice's offer."
