"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While I'd ideally like to get more than $8,000, Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.  Since we're only in round 2, there's a risk of further negotiation dragging on and potentially leading to a lower offer or even a failed deal.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum price and ensures I don't lose out on the opportunity to sell to John."
