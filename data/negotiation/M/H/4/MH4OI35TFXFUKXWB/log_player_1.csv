Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this product would be a great addition to my business, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident this product can bring a lot of value to your business. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $1,700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

Even though Bob's offer is now above John's, I still believe I can negotiate a better price.  I'm willing to push a little further before accepting or going with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,700,000 is closer, but I need to be closer to $1,800,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $1,780,000? This is a significant investment for both of us, and I want to ensure we reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to try to find a middle ground. How about $1,750,000? I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,750,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away or the negotiations dragging on."
