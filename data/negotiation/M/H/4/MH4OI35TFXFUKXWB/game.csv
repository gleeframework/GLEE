"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  I think it could really benefit your business. To start, I'm proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a solution that works for both of us.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this product would be a great addition to my business, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident this product can bring a lot of value to your business. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,700,000 is closer, but I need to be closer to $1,800,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $1,780,000? This is a significant investment for both of us, and I want to ensure we reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1780000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to try to find a middle ground. How about $1,750,000? I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
