"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,400,000, considering the market value and other options available. Can we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While $1,300,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to find a price that reflects the true value of this product for your business.  Given the potential for [mention specific benefits again, tying to Bob's needs], I'd be willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price would allow both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1,200,000. Can we discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm still eager to find a solution that works for both of us. While $1,200,000 is lower than what I initially hoped for, I'm willing to bridge the gap a bit further. How about we settle at $1,250,000?  This would allow us to finalize the deal and ensure the product delivers its full potential for your business.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think $1,200,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can we meet at $1,200,000 or I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
