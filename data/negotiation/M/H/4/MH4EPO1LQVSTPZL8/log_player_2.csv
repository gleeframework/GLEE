"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that you might be interested in. I know it's worth $80 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is closer to your perceived value than her initial asking price, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and securing the lower price."
