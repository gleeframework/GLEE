"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this product would be a great fit for me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
