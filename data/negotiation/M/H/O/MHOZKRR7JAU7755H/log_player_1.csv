Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  This leaves room for negotiation without you having to immediately drop your price too low.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This incentivizes Bob to accept the offer since he's getting a deal. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This keeps the negotiation focused and avoids confusion. 

Remember, this is just the initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept given his counteroffer, it's important to remember:

* **Your minimum acceptable price:** You stated the product is worth no less than $800,000 to you. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer leaves very little room for you to negotiate back up to a more profitable price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can send a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This still allows you to get a good deal, while also ensuring I get a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

Here's why this is a good counteroffer:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price:** You're not giving away the product for less than what it's worth to you.
* **It's a compromise:** You're showing a willingness to negotiate, but you're not giving in completely.
* **It's still a good deal for Bob:**  The price is significantly below what the product is worth to him.
* **It keeps the negotiation going:** This keeps the door open for further discussion and potentially a better deal for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference again and settle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your stated goal of earning as much money as possible.  

You have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $800,000. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will yield a higher price, and the risk of continuing the negotiation might lead to a lower price or a breakdown in communication. 

Therefore, the most sensible decision is to sell the product to John and secure the guaranteed $800,000."
