Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. This is a common negotiation tactic. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'll counter with a lower price, aiming to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $10,500, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum. This shows flexibility while still trying to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold and getting lower with each round.  While it might be possible to continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer again is too high. I'm confident John will buy the product for $10,000, which meets my minimum requirement.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed deal and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
