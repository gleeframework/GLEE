"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we settle on $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $925,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but  $850,000 is cutting it a bit too close. This product offers significant value, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Would you be willing to consider $890,000? I believe this reflects a mutually beneficial agreement.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you be willing to consider $875,000? I think this is a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,6,
