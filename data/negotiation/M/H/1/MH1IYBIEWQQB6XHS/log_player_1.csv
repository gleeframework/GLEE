"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $900,000 is still a decent amount, I'm confident I can do better."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push him further. I'm confident I can get closer to $1,000,000 without risking selling to John."
