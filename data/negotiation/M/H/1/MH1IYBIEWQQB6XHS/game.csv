"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000.  It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's try to find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're eager to finalize this deal, but $950000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you a little closer to the middle ground. How about we settle on $1000000? This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's close this deal, and you'll be happy with the outcome.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my target, but I still think $1000000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $980000. Can you meet me at this price?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and we're getting very close. However, $980000 is still just a little too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $990000. This price would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.  What do you say?",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm almost there, but I'm still not willing to pay $990000. I'm willing to meet you at $985000. Can you consider this price?",985000.0,Bob,8,
