"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $800,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant step down from Alice's price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's close enough to my maximum price of $800,000 to be attractive, but still leaves Alice with a profit.  I'm hoping this will encourage her to accept, but I'm also prepared to walk away if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still higher than my maximum price of $800,000. While it's closer to my budget than her previous offer, it's still not a good deal. I will continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's counteroffer.  It's still above my ideal price of $800,000, but it shows that I'm willing to meet Alice halfway.  Hopefully, she'll see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $980,000 is getting very close to my maximum price of $800,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of not getting a deal at all is increasing. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid any further negotiation.  I've secured a better price and saved myself a significant amount of time and effort."
