Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well above my estimated value of $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This would still be a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
