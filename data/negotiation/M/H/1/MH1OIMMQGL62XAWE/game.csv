"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal considering the product's worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
