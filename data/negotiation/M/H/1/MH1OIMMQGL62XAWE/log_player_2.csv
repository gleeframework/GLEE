Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price."
