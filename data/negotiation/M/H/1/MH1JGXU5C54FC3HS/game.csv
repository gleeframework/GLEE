"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  That's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $85, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $105? It's still a great deal for both of us!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $95.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $110? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value the product brings",110.0,Alice,5,
