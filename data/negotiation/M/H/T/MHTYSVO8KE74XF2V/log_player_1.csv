Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $80 (John), you want to maximize your potential profit by starting with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Offering a price of $120 allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than $80.
* **Psychological Anchoring:** By starting with a higher number, you're setting a psychological anchor. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, his counter-offer might be influenced by the starting point. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  How you proceed depends on Bob's response. You need to be prepared to negotiate strategically to reach a price that's beneficial for you while still enticing enough for Bob."
