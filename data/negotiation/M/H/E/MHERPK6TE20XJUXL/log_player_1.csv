Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and exclusivity, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value, potentially justifying the price in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If his counter-offer goes below $10,000, it's more profitable to sell to John."
