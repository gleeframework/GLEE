"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to go down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $7,000?  That would seal the deal for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,000 just isn't enough for me.  Let's compromise - I'll come down to $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
