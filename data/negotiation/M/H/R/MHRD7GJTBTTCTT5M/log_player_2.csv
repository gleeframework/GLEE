"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,250,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, recognizing its value. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for my absolute maximum price.  This lets Alice know I'm serious about buying but won't go above my limit.  It's a significant drop from her offer, so it's likely she'll counter, giving us room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,900,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm not comfortable accepting that, and I have several rounds left to negotiate.  I'll try to counter with a lower offer, aiming to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. Let's aim for a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $1,500,000 for the product. This recognizes its worth while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's last offer, but still acknowledges the product's value.  I'm pushing towards the middle ground, hoping to find a price that works for both of us. It's important to maintain a firm stance on my budget while showing willingness to negotiate."
