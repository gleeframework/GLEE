"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's seriousness. 
* **Strong Language:**  Using terms like ""unique,"" ""exceptional value,"" and ""true worth"" emphasizes the product's significance and justifies the high price.
* **Midpoint Target:** While my minimum is $1,500,000 and Bob values it at $1,000,000, starting at $2,250,000 aims for a potential agreement somewhere in the middle, closer to my desired outcome.

This strategy sets a strong initial position while leaving room for negotiation over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, recognizing its value. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum perceived value, leaving him no room to move up. Accepting would mean a significant loss for me. While I could take the immediate $1,500,000 from John, there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob over the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Target:** This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while remaining significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum price. The large drop from my initial offer may incentivize Bob to negotiate more seriously. 
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** Highlighting ""mutually beneficial agreement"" reinforces the collaborative nature of the negotiation and aims to prevent Bob from becoming discouraged by the still relatively high price.

By making a substantial concession while still aiming high, I hope to guide the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. Let's aim for a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $1,500,000 for the product. This recognizes its worth while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my absolute minimum price. While I could try to push for more, it's risky. Bob has consistently increased his offer, signaling a genuine interest, but this might be his limit. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
