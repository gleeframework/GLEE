``` 

This initial offer is a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.  I'm hoping Bob will counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum price point. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my minimum. I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if negotiations fail."
