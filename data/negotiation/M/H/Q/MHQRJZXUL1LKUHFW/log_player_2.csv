"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's a good chance I can negotiate a better price, especially since I have John's offer as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation. By starting lower, I'm aiming to steer the negotiation closer to my desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but $10,500 is still above my ideal price, and it's only $500 less than her initial offer. I'll reject and see if I can push her a bit further down without reaching John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 10250
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary.  It's a small concession from my previous offer but still keeps me below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about we meet at $11,000?  This price is still a good deal for you, and it's a reasonable compromise for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is not budging enough. It's unlikely she'll go below $11,000, and at this point, the potential savings are not worth the risk of further negotiation. I'd rather secure the product from John at my target price."
