Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob, making it more appealing to him.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation by asking for his thoughts. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** The higher starting price gives me more leverage.
* **Encourage Bob to counter:** An open-ended question makes it more likely Bob will make a counteroffer, allowing for further negotiation.
* **Maintain control:**  I'm still leaving myself the option to walk away and sell to John if negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees my minimum desired profit, and  I have room for negotiation with Bob.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintain leverage:**  While this is a lower price than my initial offer, it's still above Bob's offer and above my minimum acceptable price.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find common ground:**  A compromise position might be more appealing to Bob.
* **Keep negotiations moving forward:**  A counteroffer shows I'm serious about selling to Bob.
* **Maintain potential profit:**  This price is still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Selling to John guarantees a profit of $12,000, which is my minimum target.  However,  Bob's offer is also close enough that I want to continue negotiating. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter again, aiming for a price closer to $11,000.  This keeps the pressure on Bob and allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about we meet at $11,000?  This price is still a good deal for you, and it's a reasonable compromise for me."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a slight increase:** I'm proposing a price that's higher than Bob's last offer but still lower than my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm firm on my minimum desired price.
* **Emphasis on value for Bob:**  I'm highlighting that $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob, which might encourage him to accept.
* **Framing it as a compromise:**  I'm presenting it as a ""reasonable compromise"" for both of us. This appeals to Bob's sense of fairness and might make it easier for him to agree. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  This offer is closer to Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain pressure:**  A higher counteroffer keeps the pressure on Bob to meet my expectations. 
* **Preserve profit:**  While this is lower than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price."
