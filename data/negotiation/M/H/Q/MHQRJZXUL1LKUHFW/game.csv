"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That's a fair compromise.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about we meet at $11,000?  This price is still a good deal for you, and it's a reasonable compromise for me.",11000.0,Alice,5,
