"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. It's a significant price drop, but I believe it's a more reasonable price for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price is still quite a bit above your offer, but it reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
