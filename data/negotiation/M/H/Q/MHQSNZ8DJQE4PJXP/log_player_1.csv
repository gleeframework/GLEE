Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. It's a significant price drop, but I believe it's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can do better."

Let me know if you're interested in this compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Bob's offer:

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I consider fair. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with John, who's already willing to pay $1,200,000.  I'll take the guaranteed sale with John."
