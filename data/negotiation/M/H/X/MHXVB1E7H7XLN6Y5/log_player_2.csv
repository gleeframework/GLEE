"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value might differ. I'm willing to start at $95 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our $80 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $80 maximum. This approach might encourage Alice to engage in a more active negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I'm unable to accept $65 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is closer to our goal, we're still not at our ideal price point. We should counter-offer again and try to meet somewhere between $65 and $75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a premium product, Alice. How about we settle on $70? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between her last offer ($75) and our previous offer ($65). This shows a willingness to compromise while still moving towards our target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob. Considering its value, I propose we meet closer to my initial offer at $80. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our maximum price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John, as they both offer the product at $80."
