"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, there's potential to save even more by making a counteroffer.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and see if he can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going down to $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,800, which is a good deal for Bob.  He is aiming to save as much money as possible, and while he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away. At this point, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price lower than John's, achieving his goal of saving money."
