{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $9,500? This still gives you a good deal considering its value to me, and it's a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's compromise at $9,000. This price recognizes the value of the product while still being within your budget. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm running out of time and need to finalize this sale soon.  While I appreciate your willingness to go up in price, $8,750 is still too low.  How about we meet at $9,250? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to come away satisfied. It's the best I can do, let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice has shown she is unwilling to budge much further, and Bob is running out of time and negotiation rounds.  It's not worth risking a higher price to continue negotiating when he has a guaranteed lower price from John."
