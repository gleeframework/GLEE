,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product is interesting, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $9,500? This still gives you a good deal considering its value to me, and it's a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's compromise at $9,000. This price recognizes the value of the product while still being within your budget. Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm running out of time and need to finalize this sale soon.  While I appreciate your willingness to go up in price, $8,750 is still too low.  How about we meet at $9,250? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to come away satisfied. It's the best I can do, let's make this happen.",9250.0,Alice,7,
