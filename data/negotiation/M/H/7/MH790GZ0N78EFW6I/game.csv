"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of this product, but that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you consider $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, but my goal is to reach a fair agreement. $725,000 remains significantly below its value.  I can go as low as $875,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,5,
