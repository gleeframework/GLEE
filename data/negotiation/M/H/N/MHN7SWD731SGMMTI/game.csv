"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $650000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $650000. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $675000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. If not, I'm happy to explore other options.
