"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you could be much higher. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $900000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to offer $950000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think I can do a bit better. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1050000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1050000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's the highest I can go, so let's see if we can finalize this.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1000000, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1025000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
