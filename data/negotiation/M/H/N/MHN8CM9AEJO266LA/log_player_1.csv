Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than what John is offering.
* **The message** is friendly and inviting, aiming to encourage Bob to seriously consider my offer. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get close to my target price. I'm prepared to counter if Bob rejects, but I'll always have the option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* I'm not willing to sell for that price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.
* Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $950,000 is a compromise, significantly higher than Bob's offer but still below my initial offer.
* **Message:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone, acknowledging Bob's interest, and highlighting the ""good deal"" aspect. 
* **Strategy:**  I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further while staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest,  $900,000 is the highest I can go. If that works, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $900,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.** While it's lower than I'd like, it's a significant improvement over his previous offer. 
* **I'm willing to take the risk and accept Bob's offer.** I'm confident that I can still earn a reasonable profit.
* **The possibility of a counteroffer:** I could reject Bob's offer and try to get him to pay closer to my minimum price, but there's a risk that he'll walk away from the deal entirely.
* **Selling to John:** While John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm not guaranteed that he will stay interested if I reject Bob's offer. 
* **Overall:** Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision in this scenario, ensuring a sale and maximizing my potential profit."
