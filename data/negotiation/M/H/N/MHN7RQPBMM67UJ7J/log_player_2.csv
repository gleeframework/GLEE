# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and potential impact on your endeavors, I am offering it to you at a special price of $12,000. This is a fair and advantageous deal considering the product's worth to you and my desire to ensure it reaches the right hands. I trust this proposal aligns with your expectations and budget. Should you have any questions or wish to proceed, please let me know promptly. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is a reasonable price, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. Your goal is to save as much money as possible, so buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
