Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but still offer Bob a price that seems attractive.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $9,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, while still ensuring Alice a good profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position, allowing her to be a bit bolder with her initial offer to Bob."
