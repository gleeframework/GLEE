"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $119. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice values the product at $100. There is room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:

It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is willing to sell for $115.  There's still some room for a compromise."
