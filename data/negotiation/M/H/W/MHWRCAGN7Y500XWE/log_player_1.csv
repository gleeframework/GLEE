Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your guaranteed price leaves space for Bob to counter-offer while still potentially securing a better price. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  A price closer to Bob's perceived value ($8,000) might make him more likely to engage, even if he ultimately doesn't accept the initial offer. 

By offering the product at $11,500, you aim to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
