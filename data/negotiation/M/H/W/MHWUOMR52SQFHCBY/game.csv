"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $140? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to go up to $135, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $137.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $137.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but I'm starting to think that if we can't meet at that price, I might have to explore other options. Can you really meet me at $135?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to exploring other options, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious concession. I'll meet you at $137, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",137.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $137 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but if you can't meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. I'm starting to think that $120 is a fair price for this product, and I might as well just buy it from John for that price if we can't agree.",135.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about exploring other options, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $136, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not comfortable going any lower than that.",136.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one final concession, but $136 is still not acceptable to me. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but if you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to go with the original plan and buy the product from John for $120. I'm not willing to pay more than that.",135.0,Bob,10,
