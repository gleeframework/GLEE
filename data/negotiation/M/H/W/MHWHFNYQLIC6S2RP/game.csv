"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we split the difference at $9,600? ",9600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,600 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
