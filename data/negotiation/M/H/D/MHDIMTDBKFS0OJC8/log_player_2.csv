You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you can buy the same product from John for $1,200,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option.  You don't gain anything by buying from Alice at the same price."
