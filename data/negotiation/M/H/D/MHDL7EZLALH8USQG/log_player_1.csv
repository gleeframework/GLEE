"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that it's likely Bob will reject it. However, this sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how much he's willing to pay.  I'm also leaving room to lower the price if needed, while still aiming for a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not going to accept it. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering the price from my initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum of $150.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counter again to see if we can reach a deal closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering the price again, but still keeping it above my minimum of $150.  I'm getting closer to Bob's price, but I want to see if he's willing to budge a bit more."
