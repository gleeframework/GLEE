"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,200,000 is significantly below my bottom line. To move things forward, I can offer it to you for $1,450,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $1,300,000. This is my final offer for now.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. It seems we're getting closer. How about we bridge the remaining gap â€“ I can come down to $1,375,000.  This reflects my strong desire to close the deal today.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but that's as high as I can go. This is my final offer.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
