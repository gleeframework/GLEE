"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $16,000. I believe it's a great deal, and you'll get excellent value for your money. However, I have another buyer, John, who is also interested and willing to pay $15,000. So, you have the chance to secure this product at a slightly higher price than John would pay. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
