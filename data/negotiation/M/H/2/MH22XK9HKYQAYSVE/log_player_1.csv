Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I believe a price of $1,100,000 would be fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to aim for the maximum, it's risky. Offering it at his maximum valuation leaves no room for negotiation and might make him suspicious.
* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It allows for some negotiation downward while still securing a significant profit for Alice ($300,000 above her minimum).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John. Knowing this allows her to be more assertive in her pricing with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. A more aggressive approach might involve a higher initial offer. However, this strategy balances risk and reward effectively."
