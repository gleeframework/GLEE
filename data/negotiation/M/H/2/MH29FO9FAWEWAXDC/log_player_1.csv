"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. This leaves us room for negotiation to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I begin with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and anchors the price high in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions negotiation, signaling to Bob that I'm willing to come down from my initial price. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The language focuses on the ""value,"" ""potential,"" and a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" to create a positive and collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. While I acknowledge the product's value, I'm only willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and my budget. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm confident this is a reasonable starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum perceived value, leaving no room for negotiation upwards from that point. While I could secure a deal now, it would be at a significant loss compared to selling to John. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a loss when I have a guaranteed buyer at a higher price.  I'll use the next round to try and bring Bob closer to a price that's acceptable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  However, my initial offer reflected the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but to make this work for both of us, I need to see a price closer to $2,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's worth.  Are you open to exploring options in this range?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Position:** I start by acknowledging Bob's budget to show I understand his perspective.
* **Reiterating Value:** I subtly remind Bob of the product's value to justify my position without sounding dismissive of his offer.
* **Significant Price Reduction:** I'm making a substantial drop from $2,250,000 to $2,000,000 to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate upward. 
* **Framing as Compromise:**  By presenting it as a compromise, I emphasize my willingness to move towards a deal while still aiming for a favorable price.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question at the end encourages Bob to engage and counter-propose instead of simply saying yes or no."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair midpoint between our current positions, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to both of us. I'm eager to finalize this deal, but I need to stay within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now showing a willingness to negotiate upwards, which is positive. However, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I need to signal that while I'm willing to negotiate further, I'm not going to settle for a price that's a significant loss compared to selling to John. I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway between your offer and my previous price at $1,625,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done while still reflecting the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1625000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** I acknowledge Bob's movement on price to encourage further concessions.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Proposing a price directly in the middle of our last offers suggests fairness and a desire to compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $1,625,000 is a strong move towards my minimum price while still leaving some negotiation space.
* **Reiterating Value:** I continue to emphasize the product's value to justify the price without directly dismissing Bob's offer.
* **Solution-Oriented Language:** Phrases like ""find a solution"" and ""getting this deal done"" maintain a collaborative and positive tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,625,000 is still above my limit. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us and my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now repeated his previous offer of $1,250,000 and is signaling that he is unwilling to move significantly higher.  There are a few factors contributing to my decision to sell to John:

* **Limited Upside with Bob:** It's unlikely Bob will go much higher than his current offer, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of him walking away. 
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price. There's no risk of losing the sale or having to negotiate further.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Every round spent negotiating with Bob is an opportunity cost. Closing the deal quickly with John allows me to access and utilize the funds sooner.

While I might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth the risk of losing the guaranteed sale to John at this point."
