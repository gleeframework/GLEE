"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,050,000. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,050,000 is quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefit to your business. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This price reflects both the product's value and my budgetary constraints.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,175,000 is still significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000 as a final compromise.  This price reflects the potential benefit to your business and gives me a fair return on my investment.  Let's make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
