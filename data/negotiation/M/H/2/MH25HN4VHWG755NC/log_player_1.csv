{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is above my minimum desired price of $10,000, but also leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay closer to the value I know the product holds for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can push him higher, and hopefully closer to $13,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $11,500 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $11,750? This is the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a fair compromise, considering he is willing to pay more than my minimum desired price.  While I'd prefer closer to $13,000, accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit.  It's also better than selling to John for $10,000."
