"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $11,500 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $11,750? This is the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11750.0,Bob,4,
