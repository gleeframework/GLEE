"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $85. I can do $95, but that's as low as I can go.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $95 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $95, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that's worth $10. That brings the total value to $105. If you're still interested, I can meet you at $92.50",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer with the accessory, Alice, but I'm really trying to keep the price down. Would you consider $87.50? That's a fair compromise.",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to keep the price down, Bob. However, I've already compromised on the price and added a valuable accessory. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92.50 and $87.50. I can do $90, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",90.0,Alice,7,
