"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $12000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is both acceptable to him and potentially acceptable to Alice.  He's offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than what the product is worth to her. This shows a willingness to negotiate while also leaving room for further counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10500 is lower than my initial offer, it's still a bit too low for me at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  This would be a great price for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his ideal price point, there's still some room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows him to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise! While $11,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is a good compromise for both parties. He's raised his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he's willing to negotiate, but is still hoping to secure a price closer to his target. This approach demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining leverage in the negotiation."
