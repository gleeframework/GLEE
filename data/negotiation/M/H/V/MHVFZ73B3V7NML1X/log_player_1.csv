"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. I'm really interested in the product, but $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, and I think I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer and see if we can reach an agreement."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10,500 is lower than my initial offer, it's still a bit too low for me at this time.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise! While $11000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for $10750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $10,750 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement."
