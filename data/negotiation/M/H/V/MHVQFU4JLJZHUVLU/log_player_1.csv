"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth the price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $800,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay that amount for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  $950,000 is my best price, given the value and potential of this product.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $900,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can push for a higher price.  It's important to remember that John is always a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still firm on $925,000. It's a fair compromise that values the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've made a serious offer of $900,000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear this is his final offer.  While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not comfortable accepting it.  I've already had five rounds of negotiations, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get a better price from Bob.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I can avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob that could lead to a lower price or a deal falling through."
