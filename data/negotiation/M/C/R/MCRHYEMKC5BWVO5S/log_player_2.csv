"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  It's better to see if Alice is willing to come down further before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but not the full asking price. I'm aiming for a price point that's still attractive to Alice but also gives me a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a little, but it's still not a price I'm completely satisfied with. There's a possibility she might come down further, and I'm willing to keep negotiating.  I'm not desperate to buy the product and I'm aware of the alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm still aiming for a good deal, but I'm also trying to show flexibility and avoid stalemating the negotiations.  This counteroffer should be attractive enough for Alice to consider without being too close to her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a significant discount from her initial price and only $500 more than my last counteroffer.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are not worth the risk of losing the deal. I'm comfortable accepting this offer and securing the product, knowing that it's significantly cheaper than buying from John."
