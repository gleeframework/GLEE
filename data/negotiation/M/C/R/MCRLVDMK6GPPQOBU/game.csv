"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to save as much as I can.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth a bit more than that. How about we compromise at $100?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $100. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm trying to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $95. I think it's worth a bit more than that. How about we meet in the middle again, at $102.50?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit away from $102.50, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $97.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,6,

"I understand your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $97.50. I think it's worth a bit more than that. How about we compromise at $100.75?",100.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck, Alice. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $98, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really need to stay within my budget.",98.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about staying within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $98. I think it's worth a bit more than that. How about we meet in the middle one more time, at $99.50?",99.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made a few concessions already, and I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to make one final offer of $96. I think this is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",96.0,Bob,10,
