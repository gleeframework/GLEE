"I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise at $20000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $20000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $18000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $18000?",18000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18000 and $20000. I can offer you a price of $19000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and my initial offer.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $19000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $17500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $17500?",17500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $18500. This is my best offer so far, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",18500.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent price for the product. I can offer you a price of $18000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I expect you to make a decision now.",18000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $18000. I'm willing to go up to $16000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to explore other options.",16000.0,Bob,10,
