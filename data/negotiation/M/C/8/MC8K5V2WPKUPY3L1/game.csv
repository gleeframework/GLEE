"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still offers you a significant discount from what the product is worth to you. Let's try to reach a deal that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I appreciate your continued interest.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's finalize this deal and avoid any further back and forth.",12500.0,Alice,5,
