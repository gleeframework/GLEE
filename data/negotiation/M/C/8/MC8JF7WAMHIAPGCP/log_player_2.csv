"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $11500. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum, you can likely get a better deal. You know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and she's motivated to sell. Rejecting the offer gives you leverage to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $10500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11000. It's still a great deal considering its value to you is $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already lowered her price, showing she's motivated to sell.  While $11,000 is still better than John's offer, you can likely negotiate further. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice and gives you another opportunity to make a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I can offer the product to you for $11200. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, she's still at $11,200, which is further from your target price of $10,000 than John's offer. At this point, the negotiation is likely to be drawn out and time-consuming, and John offers a guaranteed price within your budget. Buying from John is the most efficient and cost-effective choice."
