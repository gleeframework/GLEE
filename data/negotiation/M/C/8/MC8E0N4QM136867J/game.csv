"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $10500 is still a bit outside my budget.  Could you go down to $10000? That's my absolute limit, but I'm confident we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $11000. I can see that you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
