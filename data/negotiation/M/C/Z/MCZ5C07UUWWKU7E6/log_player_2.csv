You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can still do better by counteroffering and potentially get the product for closer to his $8,000 limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  The product is worth more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know if that works for you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still potentially do better by counteroffering again. There's room for negotiation, and he can aim for a price closer to his $8,000 limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $9,000.  However, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  This would be a good price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  What do you think?

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his $8,000 limit. At this point, it's better for Bob to accept the guaranteed deal with John.  There's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and it's not worth risking going over his limit."
