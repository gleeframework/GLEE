"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  What do you think about $140?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While the price is higher than Alice's valuation, accepting the offer at $140 is the best choice for Bob in this scenario. It's cheaper than John's $150 offer and still falls within Bob's $150 budget."
