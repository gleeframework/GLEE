"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $140. It's a great deal, as it's worth more than that to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You value the product at $150 and Alice is offering it for $140, which is a better deal.
* **You're getting a good price.** While you'd ideally like to pay less, $140 is still within your budget and a good deal considering the product's value to you."
