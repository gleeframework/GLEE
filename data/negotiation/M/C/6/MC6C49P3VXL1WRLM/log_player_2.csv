"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still well below its worth to you. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $1,400,000 saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John.
* Even though the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, your goal is to save money, not necessarily get the lowest possible price."
