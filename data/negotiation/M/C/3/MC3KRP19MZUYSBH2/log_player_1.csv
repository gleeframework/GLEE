"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for negotiation space and might pique Bob's interest.  I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to hold out for a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $1,700,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that I believe the product is worth more than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000, which is what John is offering. I'll reject his offer and see if he'll come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about making a deal with him, while still maintaining a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still too low, but he's getting closer.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get him to raise his price again.  We are running out of rounds, but I'm still holding out for more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm making a final push with this offer of $1,400,000.  I'm coming down in price, but I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to make a deal. We're getting close to the end of our rounds, and I'm not willing to sell for less than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are running out of rounds, and Bob's offer is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm not confident I can close the deal with Bob, so I'll take John's offer of $1,500,000 to ensure I get a price that's worth it to me."
