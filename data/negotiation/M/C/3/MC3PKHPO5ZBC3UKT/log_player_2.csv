"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  You can get the product for $100 from John, but seeing if you can get it for less from Alice is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to do $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 108? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
It's better to accept Alice's offer and buy the product for $108.  While you can buy it from John for $100, it's more beneficial to close the deal with Alice at this point. You have already saved $2.  Further negotiations might take longer and risk Alice walking away from the deal."
