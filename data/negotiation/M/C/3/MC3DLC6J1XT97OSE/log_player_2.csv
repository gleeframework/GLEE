# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $1100000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident that we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $900000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating,  the risk of not reaching an agreement within the remaining rounds is high.  I'm better off taking the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000."
