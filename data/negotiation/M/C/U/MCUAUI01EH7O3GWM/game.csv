"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the substantial value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hoping to close this deal, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm prepared to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This price reflects the product's true value, and it would be a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
