Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I have 8 rounds remaining to negotiate with Bob.  I'll try to get a better price."
