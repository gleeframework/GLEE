Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is worth a great deal to you.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting price is $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the value to Bob and emphasizing finding a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Openness:**  I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, keeping the negotiation going. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) while still being higher than my minimum ($1,000,000). By starting high and being open to counteroffers, I can explore the possibility of a higher price while maintaining flexibility. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1150000 is a bit too high for me. Given what I know about the product, I'm willing to offer $1050000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I would get from John.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  There's room to negotiate further.  Bob has shown he's willing to pay more than $1,000,000.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.  I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer, but still below Bob's perceived value. This will allow me to potentially secure a higher price while keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price is still fair to both of us and allows for a successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and justification:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and suggesting a compromise, while justifying my counteroffer by emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Middle ground:** The $1,100,000 price is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, suggesting I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to go too low.
* **Positive framing:** I'm focusing on a ""successful transaction"" to highlight the potential benefits for both of us.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer allows for a potential middle ground while still keeping my minimum in mind.  The goal is to find a price that is both acceptable to Bob and allows me to achieve a higher profit than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1100000 is still a little high. I'm willing to go up to $1075000. This is a fair compromise and I believe it allows for a smooth transaction. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is only $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower offer from Bob or a stalemate.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and secures a price close to my minimum, leaving room for potential profit.  While I would prefer a higher price, the potential for further negotiation could lead to a lower offer or a prolonged process.  By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale and can focus on other opportunities."
