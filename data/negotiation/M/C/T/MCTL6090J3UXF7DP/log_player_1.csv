**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to your $1,200,000 walk-away point. You have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. 

At this stage, continuing negotiations with Bob risks:

* **Wasting time and effort:** You have limited rounds, and further haggling might not result in a significant increase from Bob.
* **Losing John's offer:** There's no guarantee John's offer will stand indefinitely.

It's strategically advantageous to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risking a lower final offer from Bob."
