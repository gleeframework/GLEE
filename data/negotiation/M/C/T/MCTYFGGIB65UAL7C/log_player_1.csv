Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000** is a fair starting point. It's higher than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still provides a substantial profit for me. 
* The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer without being aggressive. 
* I'm not aiming for the full $1,500,000 value to Bob right away, as I want to leave space for a potential counteroffer and further negotiations.

This strategy balances maximizing my profit with encouraging a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. That's the value I've seen similar products going for, and I'd like to stay within that range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum desired price, I believe I can do better. Here's why:

* **Bob's valuation:** He acknowledges the product is worth more to him ($1,500,000), so there's room for compromise.
* **Potential counteroffer:** I can counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer ($1,400,000), aiming for a deal closer to the middle ground.

By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I maintain control of the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for this particular product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to him and emphasizing the benefit of this price for both of us.
* **Tone:** The message is still friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

This counteroffer is strategic:

* **Increases my profit:** $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's offer.
* **Shows flexibility:** I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to undervalue the product.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can further adjust my price based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $1250000? That's the highest I can go without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of losing a deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I'll be left with only John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Time and effort:** Further negotiation might take more time and effort without a guarantee of a better price.

Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice, considering the potential risks and the fact that it's very close to my minimum acceptable price."
