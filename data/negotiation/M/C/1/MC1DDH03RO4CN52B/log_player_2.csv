"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm asking $15000 for it, but I'm confident it's worth more than that.  I understand this is a significant investment, so I'm happy to answer any questions you have.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this product could be truly beneficial for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. There's no incentive to accept it. You can get the same product from John for the same price. You might be able to negotiate with Alice if you reject her offer, but there's no guarantee she'll lower her price."
