"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than Alice's value of $12,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to his maximum budget but still leaves some room for negotiation. This initial counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. It's still a great price for a product worth $12000, and it gives us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making another counteroffer, but this time he's going up slightly from his previous offer. He's signaling that he's willing to compromise but still wants a good deal.  The offer of $10,750 is a good compromise because it is closer to Alice's offer but still remains under Bob's maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing if we can find a compromise.  I'm willing to go down to $10900. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the best I can offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This time, Alice's offer is $10,900, which is only $900 above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance Alice will not budge any further. It's more likely that Bob will have to pay the extra $900 to get the product from Alice than to find a better deal in further negotiations.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product and saves time compared to continuing to negotiate."
