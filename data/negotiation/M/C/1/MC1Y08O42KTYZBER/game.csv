"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This leaves a good margin for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  That said, $1,025,000 is still a touch higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $960,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",960000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
