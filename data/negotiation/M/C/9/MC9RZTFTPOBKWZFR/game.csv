"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $800000 is below my minimum acceptable value, I'm willing to compromise. I'd be happy to accept $1200000 for the product. This price reflects the unique value it offers and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $900000. I believe this price reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,
