"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is far too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 is a good backup option, but there's potential to get the product for less by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a bold counteroffer at my maximum price. This forces Alice to either accept and give me the product at my desired price, or to counteroffer and show their willingness to negotiate. This is the starting point for a negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down in price, but it's still too high.  I'm going to keep negotiating. There's a good chance I can get a better price than John's offer by continuing to bargain with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the last round. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating but still committed to a lower price. I'm aiming for a price that's a good compromise between her last offer and my maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.
