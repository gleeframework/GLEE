"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer ($120)** is lower than your maximum budget of $150. 
* This means you're saving $30 compared to buying from John.
* It's always better to get a lower price, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible."
