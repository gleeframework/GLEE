"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it holds significant value for your business as well.  I'm starting with a price of $900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price, but I'm also open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $750,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $850,000. This price reflects both my needs and the potential benefits you'll gain from this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $775,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product and the value it holds for you.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution.  While $775,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise. I'm confident this price allows both of us to achieve our goals.  What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product and the value it holds for you. I'm getting close to my limit, so I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
