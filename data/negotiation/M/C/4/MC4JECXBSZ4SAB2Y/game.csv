"Hi Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. It's a fair price, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115. This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $115 is still below what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $120?  It's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with that.",120.0,Alice,5,
