"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems interesting, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is not terrible, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's close this deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

This is a great deal! Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I'd rather close the deal now than risk further negotiation."
