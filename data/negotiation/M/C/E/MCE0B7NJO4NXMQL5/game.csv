"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a little hesitant. How about we split the difference at $12,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
