"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, you can likely get it lower. You have room to negotiate since your maximum is $15,000 and Alice is willing to sell for $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get the price down a bit further.  Rejecting allows you to continue haggling."
