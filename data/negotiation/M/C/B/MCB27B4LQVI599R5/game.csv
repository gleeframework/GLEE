"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,600,000. Is that a price you'd be comfortable with?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,400,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,700,000. It's still a bit above your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
