Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters. I also want to make sure I make a profit over my minimum value of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell it for less than what I consider it to be worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counter-offering at $85. This is still a profit for me and is closer to Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to go below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Even though it's only slightly above my minimum, it's still a profit for me, and it avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether. I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
