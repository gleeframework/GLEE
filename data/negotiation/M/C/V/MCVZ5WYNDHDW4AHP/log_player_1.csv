**Reasoning:** 

Bob has significantly dropped his offer to $16,000. It's clear he's unlikely to meet the $19,000 mark.  While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk of him further lowballing or the negotiation stalling. Accepting John's offer ensures we get our minimum acceptable price of $15,000 without further delay or risk."
