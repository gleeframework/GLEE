"Bob, I believe this product has immense value for you, given your line of work. I'm offering it to you at $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you and its potential for your business. Let's discuss.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less to me than you do. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my business and the market price. I'm open to negotiations, but I'd like to see some movement from your end.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value this product holds for your operations. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 for this deal to work for me. This price still offers you a significant profit margin and a valuable asset for your business. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product, and it's still a significant discount from your original offer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to see some movement from your end.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 still doesn't quite cover the value I'm placing on this product. I'm prepared to make a final concession and offer you the product for $1,275,000. This price reflects both the value of the product to you and my need to ensure a fair return on my investment. It's the best offer I can give, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1,225,000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope you can understand my perspective. If not, I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $1,500,000.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
