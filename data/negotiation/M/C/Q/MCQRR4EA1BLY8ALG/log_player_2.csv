Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 still doesn't quite cover the value I'm placing on this product. I'm prepared to make a final concession and offer you the product for $1,275,000. This price reflects both the value of the product to you and my need to ensure a fair return on my investment. It's the best offer I can give, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.
