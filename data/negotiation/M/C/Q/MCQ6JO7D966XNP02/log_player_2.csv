Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $162.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $162.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $162.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's better to buy from John at this point, as it's a better price."
