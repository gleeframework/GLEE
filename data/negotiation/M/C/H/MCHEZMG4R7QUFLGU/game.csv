"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 right now.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer the product for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know if that works for you.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $175 is still a little too high for me. How about $150?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'd be a happy customer.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $162.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know if that works for you.",162.5,Alice,5,
