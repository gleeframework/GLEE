"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? I think this is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
