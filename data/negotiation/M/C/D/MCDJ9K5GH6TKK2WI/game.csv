"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $18,000 for it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $14,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $14,000. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $15,500. I think it's a great price that still reflects the product's value, and it's closer to my original price.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting a bit drawn out. I'm willing to pay $14,500, but that's my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to go with John.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go above $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, so I'm counteroffering at $15,250. This is my best and final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",15250.0,Alice,7,
