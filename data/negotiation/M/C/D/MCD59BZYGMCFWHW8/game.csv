"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
