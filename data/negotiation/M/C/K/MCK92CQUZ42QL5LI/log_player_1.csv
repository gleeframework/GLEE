{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for potential compromise. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I would like to propose a lower price of $100. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $100 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $105?  It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to meet somewhere in the middle at $102. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $102 is still above my minimum and a good compromise.  It's better to secure a sale at this price than risk further negotiation or selling to John for $100."
