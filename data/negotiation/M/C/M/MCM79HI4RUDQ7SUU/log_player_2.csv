"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I know it's worth $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's talk about a price of $1050000. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a bit lower than what the product is worth to you, it's still higher than what you'd pay John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product for $1,000,000 from John, saving you $50,000."
