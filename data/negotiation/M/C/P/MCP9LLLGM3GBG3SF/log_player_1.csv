{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to stall or lowball.
* **High Anchor:** This opening offer sets a high anchor point, making a final price closer to your desired range more likely.

It's important to balance getting the best possible price from Bob while also ensuring he doesn't walk away, leaving you to sell at your minimum to John."
