""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth much more than my asking price. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product significantly exceeds $700,000.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $875,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $875,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $785,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We are getting close to John's offer, but there is still room to negotiate with Bob. We are aiming for a much higher price than Bob is currently offering."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product. $785,000 is closer, but it's still below its true worth.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $840,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you're gaining."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  I'm getting close to my limit, but  $840,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to settle at $810,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is getting very close to John's offer and we are already above our minimum. Accepting at $810,000 secures a good profit.  Continuing to push for a higher price might encourage Bob to walk away, leaving us with John's lower offer as the only option."
