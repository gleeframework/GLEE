"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth much more than my asking price. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product significantly exceeds $700,000.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $875,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $785,000?",785000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product. $785,000 is closer, but it's still below its true worth.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $840,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you're gaining.",840000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  I'm getting close to my limit, but  $840,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to settle at $810,000?",810000.0,Bob,6,
