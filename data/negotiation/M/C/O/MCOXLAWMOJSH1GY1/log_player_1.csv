Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  This price leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested, and I know I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob isn't willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000. I'll counter his offer, but I'm prepared to sell to John if we can't reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a good price. $1,750,000 is a fair compromise, and it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counter again, but I'm getting closer to selling to John if we can't reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm making a final concession here, and offering a price that's a little below my ideal but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. If he doesn't accept this, I'll be moving on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm getting frustrated with the negotiation.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. At least I'll get a decent price, and I can move on to other opportunities."
