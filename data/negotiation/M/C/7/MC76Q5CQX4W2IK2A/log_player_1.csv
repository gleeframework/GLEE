Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,199,999. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1199999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price leaves a small margin for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quicker. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to avoid him rejecting it."
