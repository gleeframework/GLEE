"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $120. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $160. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you'll consider it.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is the highest you can go, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $160. I'm willing to give you a small discount, so I'll offer you the product for $155. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you'll consider it.",155.0,Alice,5,
