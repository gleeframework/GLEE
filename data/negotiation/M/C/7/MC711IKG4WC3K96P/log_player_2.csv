Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is the highest you can go, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $160. I'm willing to give you a small discount, so I'll offer you the product for $155. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $155.  At this point, buying from John for $150 is the most financially sound choice."
