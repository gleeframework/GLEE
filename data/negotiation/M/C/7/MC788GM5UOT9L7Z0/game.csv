"I understand you're looking for a deal, Bob. However, I've already invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $10500 to make it worth my while.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9200. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $10000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",10000.0,Alice,5,
