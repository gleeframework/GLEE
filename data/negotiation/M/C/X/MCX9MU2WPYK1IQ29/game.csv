"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. While the product sounds great, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think!",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $108. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",108.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate!  $108 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference â€“  how about $106? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $106. I'm willing to offer you a slight adjustment, and I'll sell the product to you for $109. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",109.0,Alice,5,
