"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $1240000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1290000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price again, but she's not budging much further. While $1,290,000 is still a bit above my ideal price, it's getting close to my maximum budget, and I'm confident I can get a good return on this investment. It's also significantly lower than what John is offering, so it's the better deal right now.  I'm going to accept Alice's offer."
