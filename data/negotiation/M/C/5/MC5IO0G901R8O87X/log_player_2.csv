Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I can offer you a compromise - I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I can offer you a slight discount from my original price, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for me. I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and buy from John. Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Alice has consistently rejected offers close to your $1,000,000 limit.  Her latest counteroffer suggests she's not willing to move much lower.
* **Time is a factor:**  You're losing valuable time in this negotiation. With each round, the potential for significant savings diminishes. 
* **John offers a guaranteed price:** While John's price is higher than you hoped, it's a known quantity.  Continuing with Alice could result in a similar price or even no deal at all. 

Sometimes the best negotiation is knowing when to walk away."
