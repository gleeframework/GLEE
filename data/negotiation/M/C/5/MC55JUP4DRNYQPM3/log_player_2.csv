"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than John's, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $11,500, the price is still well within his budget and significantly lower than John's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject and he'd be stuck with John's higher price."
