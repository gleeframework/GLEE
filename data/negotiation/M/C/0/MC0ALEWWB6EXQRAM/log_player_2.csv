Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. However, $65 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $75 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to work with you, but $85 is my absolute bottom line. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and you have a guaranteed option at $80 with John. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
