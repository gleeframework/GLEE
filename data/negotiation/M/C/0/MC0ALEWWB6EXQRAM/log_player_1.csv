"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, but still within a range that Bob might find appealing.  This is to maximize my potential profit. I'm also framing the offer positively to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I would like to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. However, $65 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum threshold. I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and framing the offer as a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I have a budget in mind. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm not willing to sell for less than that, even though I've already rejected two of his offers. It's important to stick to my principles and not settle for a price that I'm not comfortable with. I will continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $75 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to work with you, but $85 is my absolute bottom line. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm continuing to negotiate with Bob, but I'm getting closer to John's offer of $100. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and agree to my counteroffer."
