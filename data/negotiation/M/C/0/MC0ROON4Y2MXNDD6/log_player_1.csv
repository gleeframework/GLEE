Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm friendly and emphasize the value proposition for Bob, while also stating my own desire for a good deal. 
* **Strategy:**  I'm aiming to secure a price that is closer to my minimum value while still being attractive to Bob. By starting with a lower price, I can potentially push for a higher counteroffer, increasing my earnings.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:**  Remember, I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $1,200,000. This provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.
* **Bob's Value:**  I know Bob's product value is $800,000. This informs my pricing strategy â€“ I need to ensure my offer is higher than his value but still attractive enough to encourage a deal.
* **Negotiation Dynamics:**  This is just the first offer. Be prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, his counteroffers, and my own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's still a good price, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a huge loss for me.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating, potentially pushing for a higher price or ultimately selling to John.

**Reasoning:**

* **Financial Loss:**  $700,000 is a substantial loss compared to my minimum value and even compared to my initial offer of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** By rejecting, I signal that I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away. This could encourage Bob to increase his offer.
* **John's Offer:**  I still have John's offer of $1,200,000 as a safety net, so I can afford to be more firm with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a middle ground that is closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  I'm aiming for a compromise.  $900,000 is a significant improvement on Bob's offer while still being above his perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Message:**  I acknowledge his budget, but also reiterate the value of the product. This helps keep the negotiation open and collaborative.
* **Counteroffer:**  My new price is a middle ground, showing flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Next Steps:**  I'm now waiting for Bob's response. Depending on his reaction, I may need to adjust my strategy and potentially make another counteroffer or accept his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $850,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's previous offers, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make a profit and achieve my desired outcome.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Financial Loss:**  Even at $850,000, I would be selling the product for a significant loss compared to my minimum value of $1,200,000. 
* **Limited Upside:** Bob's counteroffer is showing a reluctance to go higher, and further negotiation might not yield a result that significantly improves the price.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay my desired price, guaranteeing the desired outcome without further negotiation.

**Decision:**

Selling to John guarantees me the best possible outcome and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who might not be willing to increase his offer significantly."
