Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $100 is above your $80 minimum, meaning you'll make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** $100 is lower than the $120 value Bob places on the product, making it attractive to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space to negotiate if Bob wants to lower the price further.

By starting with this offer, you set a strong foundation for the negotiation while keeping your profit potential in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 is a good price, it's still worth trying to get closer to my initial offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $95?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would like to get closer to $95,  $92 is still a good price and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. It's a good compromise and ensures a decent profit."
