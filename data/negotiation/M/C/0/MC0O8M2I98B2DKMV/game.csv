"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While it's certainly attractive, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price given its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This reflects the product's true worth and allows us both to benefit.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,225,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,162,500.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you think?",1162500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm eager to find an agreement, $1,162,500 falls a bit short of what I had in mind.  I'm willing to accept $1,193,750. This represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the inherent value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1193750.0,Alice,5,
