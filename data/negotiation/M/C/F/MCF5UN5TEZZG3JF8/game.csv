I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept?,108.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $111. This is a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",111.0,Alice,5,
