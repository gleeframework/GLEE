"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There's also the option of buying from John for $1,200,000, providing a baseline for Bob's negotiation strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob's counteroffer starts with a significant decrease from Alice's initial price. This signals Bob's serious intent to negotiate and sets a clear expectation of further negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $1,300,000 is still within Bob's budget and provides a reasonable margin for potential compromise.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  The message emphasizes finding ""common ground"" to keep the negotiation open and encourage further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to move forward. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has lowered her price, which is a positive sign.
* **Still above Target:** However, $1,350,000 is still higher than Bob's target price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for Improvement:**  Bob has room to negotiate further. There's a chance he can get closer to his desired price. 

Since Bob has a backup option with John, he's not under significant pressure to accept this offer.  Continuing to negotiate is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,300,000.  How about $1,325,000? That's a fair compromise, and it's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:**  Bob is moving his counteroffer incrementally closer to Alice's offer, showing that he's serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Compromise Position:**  $1,325,000 is a midpoint between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer, suggesting a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message highlights the deal being ""fair"" and ""great"" for both sides, aiming to build rapport and increase the chances of Alice accepting."
