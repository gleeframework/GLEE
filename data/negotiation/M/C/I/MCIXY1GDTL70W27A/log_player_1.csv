"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000, so you're still leaving yourself some room to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This avoids confusion and allows Bob to respond quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'm confident in the product's value and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to move forward. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,300,000.  How about $1,325,000? That's a fair compromise, and it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is only $25,000 away from my minimum price of $1,350,000. It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal rather than risking further negotiation or selling to John for a higher price but with the potential for a longer negotiation."
