"Alice, your offer is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in your product, but I can only go as high as $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $850,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
