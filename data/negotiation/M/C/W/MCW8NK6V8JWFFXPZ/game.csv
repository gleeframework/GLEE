"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that high. Given the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price point.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm eager to find an agreement, I can't quite go down to $1,050,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,075,000, but that's my final offer. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
