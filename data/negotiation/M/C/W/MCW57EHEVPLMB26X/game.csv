"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see you're serious about buying the product. How about we meet in the middle again, at $825000? It's a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $820000. That's my bottom line. If you're willing to meet me there, we can make a deal.",820000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $820000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one final offer: $800000. This is my absolute maximum budget, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John.",800000.0,Bob,10,
