,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a great price for a product worth $100 to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we meet at $82.50?",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $82.50.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $87.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",87.5,Alice,5,
