"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still well within your budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? That feels like a fair compromise.",9250.0,Bob,4,
