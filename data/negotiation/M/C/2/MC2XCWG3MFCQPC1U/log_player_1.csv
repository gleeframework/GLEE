"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It also shows Bob that I believe in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $17,500. This is still a good price for me, and it shows that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}

I'll lower my price to $16,000.  This is a compromise, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$13,000 is still too low for me. I'll try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
