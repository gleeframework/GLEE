"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that.  $130 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $140. This is a fair price, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $140, which would be $135. Can you accept this offer?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but  $135 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle *again* at $137.50. This is a good price for both of us, and I really want to make this work.",137.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but $137.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",135.0,Bob,8,
