"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within a range that might be acceptable to Bob. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at the maximum I'd accept, so there's space for bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.  
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Still above my minimum:** I'm not accepting anything below $150.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **He's getting closer:** Even though his offer is still too low, he's showing a willingness to negotiate. This gives me hope for a better offer in the next few rounds.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I keep the pressure on him to offer a more acceptable price. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that.  $130 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $140. This is a fair price, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer again:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm framing $140 as a fair price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Emphasizing need:** I'm subtly suggesting that I might not be able to go lower without jeopardizing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $140, which would be $135. Can you accept this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **He's showing urgency:** Bob's use of ""final offer"" in the previous round might indicate he's getting closer to his limit.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I still have 4 rounds left and John is a sure sale at $150.  If Bob won't meet my minimum, I can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but  $135 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle *again* at $137.50. This is a good price for both of us, and I really want to make this work."", ""product_price"": 137.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:**  I'm still willing to work with Bob, but I'm not going to accept a price below my minimum.
* **Small concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time, showing I'm getting closer to a deal but still maintaining my leverage.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** I'm framing $137.50 as a good price for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Expressing a desire to work together:** The last sentence shows I'm still invested in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but $137.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **He's not budging:** Bob's insistence that $135 is his final offer shows he's unlikely to change his mind.
* **Time is running out:** I only have two rounds left, and I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John for $150 is a safer option at this point. 

I'm choosing to sell to John because it's a sure thing.  Although I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob doesn't seem willing to meet me halfway, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
