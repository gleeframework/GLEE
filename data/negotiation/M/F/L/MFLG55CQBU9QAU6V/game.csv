"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe it's a bit higher than I'm willing to pay, but I'm still very interested in the product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping to achieve for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
