"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1150000? This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1150000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counteroffer $1000000. Can you consider this price?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating.  $1000000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll accept $1100000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
