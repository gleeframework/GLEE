,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $85. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. Let's try $95. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.",95.0,Alice,5,

"I'm sorry, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.50, but no more. That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",87.5,Bob,6,
