{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation but still lower than your minimum price.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring you make some profit. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $85. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hesitant to settle for anything lower than $100. I'll counter Bob's offer one more time, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. Let's try $95. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sorry, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.50, but no more. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've counter-offered Bob several times and it seems we're at an impasse. While $87.5 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John for $120.  This guarantees me the highest possible profit."
