"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $150 seems a bit steep for me though. Would you consider something closer to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  While $115 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing if we can find a solution that works for both of us. I can't go as low as $95, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm and unlikely to go below $105.  While getting the product for $105 is better than her initial offer, you have a guaranteed option to buy it from John for $100. It makes more sense to take the sure bet and maximize your savings."
