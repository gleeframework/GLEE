"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential and worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a high profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message frames the price as related to the product's ""immense potential and worth.""  This emphasizes value rather than simply stating a number.
* **Open to negotiation:** By calling it a ""starting point,"" I signal that I'm willing to negotiate. This encourages Bob to engage in the process.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:** His response will indicate how motivated he is to acquire the product.
2. **Anchor high:**  Even if he rejects this initial price, it sets a high reference point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me at the moment. I'm more comfortable with something around $800,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000).  This suggests he has room to move considerably. It's too early to accept such a low offer or to sell to John. I'll provide a counteroffer in the next round to guide the negotiation towards a more acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, however, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the value it offers while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection, but with acknowledgment:**  I want to acknowledge Bob's offer without sounding dismissive.
* **Significant, but not drastic, decrease:** I'm coming down $300,000 from my initial offer. This shows flexibility but also signals that I'm serious about a price above Bob's initial suggestion.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's potential to justify the higher price point. 
* **Seeking ""middle ground"":** This language frames the negotiation as collaborative and encourages Bob to move towards my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Let's meet closer to the middle - How about $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,500,000 I could get from John. Bob is clearly interested and moving in the right direction. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'll counter with a price closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,700,000. This represents a significant concession on my end and reflects my commitment to closing this deal."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I want Bob to know I see and appreciate his willingness to negotiate.
* **Significant Movement:** A $200,000 decrease is a considerable step, signaling my eagerness to close the deal but also demonstrating I'm still aiming high. 
* **Framing as ""Meeting Halfway"":**  This positions the offer as a fair compromise, even though it's closer to my previous price than Bob's.
* **Implying Scarcity:** By mentioning my ""commitment to closing this deal,"" I subtly hint that other options might be available (John) without explicitly stating it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. While $1,700,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation could drag on. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit and a quick close to the deal."
