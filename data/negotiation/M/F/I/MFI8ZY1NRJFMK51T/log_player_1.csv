Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant profit. However, this is a starting point. I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I won't go below $1,000,000, as that's my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind the potential of selling to John as a fallback option."

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm reducing my offer to $1,250,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale. I believe this price is fair and may be acceptable to Bob."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit and a better outcome than selling to John. I've successfully negotiated a higher price with Bob, achieving my goal of maximizing profit while avoiding the risk of losing the sale to John."
