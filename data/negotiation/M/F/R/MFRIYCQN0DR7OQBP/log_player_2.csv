"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you as it's well below its value to you. If you decline, I'll have to sell it to John for a lower price, so I hope you take advantage of this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing:**  Her message suggests she'll sell to John for less, but you know John's price is higher ($1,500,000). This implies she's trying to pressure you.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Alice wants to sell for more than her product is worth to her ($1,200,000). There's a good chance she'll come down in price if you reject her initial offer. 

By rejecting, you open the door to a counter-offer closer to Alice's true valuation, potentially saving you even more money."
