(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I think $130 is a fair price. I'd like to stick with my original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a higher price, Bob seems firm on $130. Accepting this offer secures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers."
