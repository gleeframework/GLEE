"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value it holds for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to find a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $16,500? This gives us both some room to compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can consider it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to sell for that price. I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500? This price is still within your stated value for the product and gives me a fair return.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's the maximum I can offer. I hope you can consider it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  Bob's counteroffer of $14,500 is still below my minimum price, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's better to take the sure thing with John and avoid the risk of getting stuck with a lower price."
