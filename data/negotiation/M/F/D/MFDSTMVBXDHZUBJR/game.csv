"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is quite high, though. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider $1,400,000. This is a more reasonable compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
