I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a high price, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm offering $9,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me. I'm not comfortable going below $8,000.  Since John is offering me my minimum, I'm going to take his offer and sell the product to him."
