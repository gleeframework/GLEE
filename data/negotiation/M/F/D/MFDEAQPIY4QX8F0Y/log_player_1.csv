"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value. I'm confident it will be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to be confident and express the value of the product while being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to accept it yet.  I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to reduce my price to $825,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still represents a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $775,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not ready to accept $775,000.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a bit more.  I'm confident I can close the deal for a price closer to my initial asking price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $775,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? This price is fair for both of us, and it ensures a smooth and successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to save some money. Would you be willing to meet me at $780,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While Bob's offer of $780,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm concerned that we're not making enough progress.  John is a reliable buyer and is willing to pay my minimum asking price.  It's not worth risking another round with Bob and potentially losing out on a sale."
