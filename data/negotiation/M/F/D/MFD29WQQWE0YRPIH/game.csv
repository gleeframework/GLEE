"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway and offering $11500?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your counteroffer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway on your previous offer. Can you consider dropping the price to $12750? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",12750.0,Bob,4,
