Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm confident that $1,200,000 is a fair price for this product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this point.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been unwavering in his valuation of the product at $1,200,000 and has now stated this is his final offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price.  While you could continue to counter, you risk Bob walking away entirely. Accepting his offer would net you the same amount as John's guaranteed offer.  It makes the most sense to take the guaranteed deal at this point."
