"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  I believe this revised offer represents a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This acknowledges the product's value while recognizing your budget considerations.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm confident that $1,200,000 is a fair price for this product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this point.  This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
