"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, I think $9,500 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it. "",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product has a lot of value, and I believe $9,000 is a fair price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down a bit, but we're still aiming for a price closer to $7,000. Let's see if we can negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget in mind.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $7,750?"",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine - $8,375? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is getting closer to our desired range, we're still a bit away. Let's counter with a price closer to our $7,000 target, knowing we still have room to negotiate before hitting John's $10,000 price."
