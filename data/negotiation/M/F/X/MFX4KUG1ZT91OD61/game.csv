"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $90? I'm really interested in this product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a decent profit on this product.
