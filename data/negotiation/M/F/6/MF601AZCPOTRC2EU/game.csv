"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to stay within a $10,000 budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and the fact that I'm committed to making a deal with you. Let's close this out.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free premium support package, which is a $1,000 value. So, if you're willing to meet me at $11,000, I'll throw in the support package. That brings the total value to $12,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",11000.0,Alice,5,
