"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product,  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to offer $9,500 for it,  seeing as it's worth $10,000 to me.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you, and I think you'll really benefit from owning this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $10,000 to me and you're already getting a profit. Let's make this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really benefit from owning this product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
