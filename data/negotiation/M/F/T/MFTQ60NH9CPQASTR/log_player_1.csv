Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to the upper end of Bob's valuation.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $15,000, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counter-offer might be more favorable than if I had started lower.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While John offers a guaranteed $10,000, aiming higher with Bob initially allows me to potentially gain an additional profit. I can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation with Bob isn't progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches his valuation and what John is offering, it's too early to accept. I started high to leave room for negotiation. By immediately accepting his first counteroffer, I signal that my initial price wasn't serious and I'm willing to settle for the minimum. I'll try to meet him somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This reflects the product's true value."", 
""product_price"": 12500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved significantly from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I've reinforced the idea of ""true value,"" subtly suggesting Bob is getting a good deal even with this compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer aims to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. While I'm open to further negotiation, this keeps the price well above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $11,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob is clearly interested and negotiating actively. His latest offer is reasonable, a good compromise between our positions, and significantly above my minimum. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains, with the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a solid profit.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal quickly with Bob is preferable to potentially lengthy negotiations or resorting to John's offer."
