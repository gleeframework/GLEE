"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $13,000 right now. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still negotiating, Bob! I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $17,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,5,
