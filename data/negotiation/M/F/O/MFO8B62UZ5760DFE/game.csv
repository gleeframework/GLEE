"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  However, $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product, which is a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I value your willingness to compromise, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really pushing my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  This is the absolute highest I can go, and I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, and I appreciate you coming up to $9,750. It's getting close to where we can both be happy.  I'm willing to come down just a bit more to $10,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",10000.0,Alice,7,
