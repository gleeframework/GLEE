Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers at $1,112,500. This is my final offer.

Bob's final offer is very close to my starting price and significantly higher than John's offer. Accepting this offer ensures I maximize my profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale."
