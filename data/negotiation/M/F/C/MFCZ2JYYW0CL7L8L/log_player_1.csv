{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

With only two rounds left, I'm realizing that I'm unlikely to get much closer to my desired price with Bob.  The negotiations have been tense and I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement. To secure a sale and avoid a potentially empty outcome, I'm going to sell to John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's the best guaranteed outcome given the current situation."
