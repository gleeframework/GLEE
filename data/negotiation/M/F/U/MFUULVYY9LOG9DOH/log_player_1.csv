Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room in case Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Time Value:** While Alice has a guaranteed $10,000 from John, selling to Bob quickly might be more appealing than waiting for the alternative deal.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't know Bob's exact valuation of $12,000. If she did, she'd offer it at $11,999!"
