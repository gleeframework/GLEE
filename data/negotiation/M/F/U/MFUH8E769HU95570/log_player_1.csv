Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is quite low, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. I believe this product will bring you significant value, and I want to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. To be honest, I'm thinking closer to $7,000. Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about $11,000? That's a significant reduction on my end and reflects my desire to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, to be completely transparent, my budget for this product is capped, and $11,000 is still beyond what I can do. I can offer a maximum of $7,500. I understand this might be a stretch, but I believe it's a fair offer given my constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a very firm ceiling to his budget. He's made three offers, all around the $7,000 mark.  It's highly unlikely he'll come close to my $12,000 minimum.  Rather than waste further time and potentially end up with an even lower offer, it's more profitable to accept John's guaranteed $12,000."
