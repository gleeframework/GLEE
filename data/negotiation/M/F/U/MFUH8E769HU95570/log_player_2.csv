"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000."", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my actual maximum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation and try to understand Alice's flexibility. 
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a low number first, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range. 

This strategy is about testing the waters and seeing how much Alice is willing to move from her initial high price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is quite low, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. I believe this product will bring you significant value, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice dropped her price significantly, which is a good sign. However, $14,000 is still way above my budget. I'll reject and counteroffer, trying to bring the price closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. To be honest, I'm thinking closer to $7,000. Would that be possible?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing Incrementally:**  I'm increasing my offer, but strategically staying well below my maximum ($8,000).
* **Honesty and Budget:** By mentioning my budget limitations (without revealing the exact number), I'm signaling a genuine interest while setting a boundary. 
* **Seeking a Feasible Price:**  The goal is to find a price Alice might actually consider, encouraging her to negotiate further towards a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about $11,000? That's a significant reduction on my end and reflects my desire to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice continues to decrease her price, $11,000 is still significantly more than I want to pay, and well above my alternative option with John. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I need to show Alice that I'm willing to walk away from the deal if it doesn't meet my budget.

I'll reject and counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my limit, but prepared to walk away if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, to be completely transparent, my budget for this product is capped, and $11,000 is still beyond what I can do. I can offer a maximum of $7,500. I understand this might be a stretch, but I believe it's a fair offer given my constraints."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer. I'm getting very close to my maximum budget, and I need to signal this clearly to Alice.
* **Transparency and Constraints:** By being transparent about my budget constraints (without revealing the exact amount), I'm hoping Alice understands I'm being serious and not just trying to lowball her. 
* **Walk-Away Point:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'm prepared to buy from John for $8,000. It's better to secure a guaranteed deal than risk losing the product altogether."
