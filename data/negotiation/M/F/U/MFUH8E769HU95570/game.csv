"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is quite low, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. I believe this product will bring you significant value, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. To be honest, I'm thinking closer to $7,000. Would that be possible?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about $11,000? That's a significant reduction on my end and reflects my desire to make this deal happen.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, to be completely transparent, my budget for this product is capped, and $11,000 is still beyond what I can do. I can offer a maximum of $7,500. I understand this might be a stretch, but I believe it's a fair offer given my constraints.",7500.0,Bob,6,
