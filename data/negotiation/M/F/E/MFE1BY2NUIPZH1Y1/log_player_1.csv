Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $160.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I believe I can offer you $140 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm looking for a price closer to $150. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $145?"", ""product_price"": 145}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I would like to counter with $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's tempting to hold out for more, but Bob seems anchored at $140.  Taking the sure $140 is better than risking getting stuck with John's $120 offer if the negotiation stalls."
