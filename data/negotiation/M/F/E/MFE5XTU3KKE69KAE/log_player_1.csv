Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way above what I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $1,200,000.  Let's start with that price and see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding the value of this product. While $2,000,000 represents its true worth, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This offer reflects my desire to find a middle ground while ensuring a fair deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, accepting $1,350,000 would still be a significant loss compared to John's standing offer. It's worth continuing the negotiation for at least another round to see if Bob is willing to move closer to $1,500,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,575,000?  This is a significant reduction on my part and represents a fair price for both of us."",
