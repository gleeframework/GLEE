"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $125?  That way we both get a good deal.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
