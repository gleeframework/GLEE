Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You won't sell for less than $15,000 as you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $10,000.  You need to offer a price that is enticing, but still significantly profitable for you.
* **Anchoring high:** Starting with a higher price ($19,000) sets an anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're starting from a strong position.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The $19,000 offer leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob, leading to a potentially higher final sale price than if you started too low.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $19,000. You have to weigh the risk of him rejecting the offer (and you getting $15,000 from John) against the potential reward of a higher sale price."
