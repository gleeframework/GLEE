"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make a deal happen.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. This product is only worth $8,000 to me, and I know I can get a similar one elsewhere for a reasonable price.  How about we start at $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $6,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?  That's a significant offer on my part.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
