I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. This product is only worth $8,000 to me, and I know I can get a similar one elsewhere for a reasonable price.  How about we start at $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
