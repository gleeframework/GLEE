"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. It's still a great deal, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000? It's still a great price for the product and it gives us both room to negotiate.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,250. It's still a bit above my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10,250 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $10,375? It's a bit above $10,000, but I'm willing to compromise.",10375.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $10,375 is still not quite there for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,562.50? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal.",10562.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get as close as possible to $10,000. How about $10,312.50? It's a bit above $10,000, but I'm willing to make a final offer.",10312.5,Bob,8,
