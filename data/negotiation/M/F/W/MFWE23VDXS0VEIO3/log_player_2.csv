You have a good chance of getting a lower price considering your previous counteroffer, and you can always choose to buy from John if negotiations fail."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,325,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product to you for $1,325,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,325,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further. You've already rejected two of her counteroffers, and it seems like she's unwilling to go lower than $1,325,000.  At this point, it's best to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $1,200,000. This ensures you get the product within your budget, avoiding further negotiation that may not be fruitful."
