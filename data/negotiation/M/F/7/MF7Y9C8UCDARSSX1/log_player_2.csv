"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something I value at least $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as I know you'd find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is $3,000 less than your maximum budget and $3,000 less than buying from John. Even though Alice values the product at a lower price, accepting her offer saves you the most money."
