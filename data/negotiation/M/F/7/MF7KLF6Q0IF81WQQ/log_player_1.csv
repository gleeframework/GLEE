Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $800,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's too far below what the product is worth to me."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is a good price, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I believe the product's worth to him justifies a slightly higher price, and I'm prepared to negotiate further."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  It's been a frustrating negotiation with Bob, and we're running out of time.  While $955,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely, so I'm going to take John's offer."
