"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Gauging Bob's Response:**  This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase and what his negotiation style might be. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob are not progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is good, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'm willing to engage in further negotiation to try and close the deal closer to $1,125,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. Bob decreased his offer by $50,000, and I'm meeting him halfway by decreasing my ask by $25,000.
* **Strong Position:**  I'm still in a strong negotiating position, as this offer is well above my minimum selling price.
* **Time Consideration:** I'm aware that we have a limited number of rounds, so I'm pushing for a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try $1,080,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating more aggressively now, but I'm not ready to concede that much. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but $1,080,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum. I need to hold my ground and signal that I'm not desperate to make a deal at any price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,110,000? This represents a significant concession on my end and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal happen."", 
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concessions:** I'm reducing my counteroffer by $15,000, a smaller amount than Bob's last decrease. This signals I'm nearing my limit.
* **Justification:** I'm highlighting that this price is a substantial concession to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly emphasizing the need for a decision soon as we're past the halfway point in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we try $1,070,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to test my resolve by making smaller and smaller concessions.  While $1,070,000 is tempting, I believe I can still get a slightly better price. I'm willing to take a calculated risk and see if he'll budge closer to $1,100,000 in the next round or two.  However, I need to be prepared to accept a smaller profit if he remains firm on his offer or walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close here. I'm willing to make one final concession to demonstrate my commitment to getting this done. Let's settle at $1,090,000. This is my best and final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my last offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still keeping the price above $1,080,000.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair compromise.
* **Walk-Away Point:**  I'm mentally prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob rejects this offer. The difference in profit at this point isn't substantial enough to continue dragging out the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your commitment to getting this deal done, but I'm still not quite there. How about we try $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is simply too low. It has become clear that he is trying to take advantage of my willingness to negotiate.  While I could continue and try to squeeze out a bit more profit, it's not worth the risk of him lowballing me further or the negotiations falling apart altogether.  

Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a good profit and avoids a potentially frustrating and time-consuming negotiation process. It's time to move on to a buyer who is more reasonable and values the product appropriately."
