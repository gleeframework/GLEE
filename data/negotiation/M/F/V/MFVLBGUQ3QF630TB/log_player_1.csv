"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to leverage the fact that Bob values the product at $800,000. This creates room for negotiation and I'm confident I can still get a good price even if he rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still far below what I consider the product's worth.  I believe I can get a better price through further negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm offering $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and what John is willing to pay. This should be a fair price for both of us, as it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I have a few more rounds to try and get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,100,000. This shows good faith and willingness to compromise, while still staying above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is tempting, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating. It's getting close to the end of the rounds, but I'm not ready to give up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, but it shows a strong willingness to reach an agreement. With only a few rounds left, I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good price and closing the deal before I have to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although $1,000,000 is a good price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to risk it and try to get a better price. I have two rounds left to negotiate and I believe I can still reach a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,025,000. It's a small compromise from my last offer but still above Bob's current offer. With only one round left, I need to make a decision to either accept Bob's offer or sell to John.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable final offer and close the deal."
