"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to Bob. It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds to go, and Bob can always choose to buy from John for $10,000 if the negotiation fails."

Round 3

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
