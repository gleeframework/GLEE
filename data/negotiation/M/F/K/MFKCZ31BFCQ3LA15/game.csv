"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? ",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  That way we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,
