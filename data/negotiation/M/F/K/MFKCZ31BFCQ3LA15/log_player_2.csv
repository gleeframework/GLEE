"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better price by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  That way we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good deal for me. It's below my maximum price of $12,000 and is still a reasonable profit for Alice, considering her value of $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate might get me a slightly lower price, but there's a risk of Alice getting impatient and choosing to sell to someone else, or me losing time and ultimately having to pay John $12,000.  It's best to accept her offer and move on."
