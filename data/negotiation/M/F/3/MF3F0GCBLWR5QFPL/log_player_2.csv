"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price point of $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering its worth to me and its potential for your business. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially save more money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  You have a significant buffer between your maximum price ($1,500,000) and her offer ($1,400,000).  Negotiating will give you the chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too far below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering the potential of this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above your target price of $1,200,000. You're still within your budget with some room to negotiate further. It's worth continuing to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your need for a good price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still firm on needing to get at least $1,300,000 for this product.  It's a unique opportunity for your company, and I believe this price reflects its value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm confident we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her price of $1,300,000.  You've already made your best offer at $1,250,000.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can budge Alice, but you're getting close to the point where it might be more advantageous to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's finalize this at $1,275,000. This is a good deal for both of us.  It's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I see we're getting closer.  However, $1,275,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,290,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to profit.  Let's close this deal now!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is within your budget and is only slightly higher than your last counteroffer of $1,275,000. Given that you only have 3 rounds left and John's price is higher, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
