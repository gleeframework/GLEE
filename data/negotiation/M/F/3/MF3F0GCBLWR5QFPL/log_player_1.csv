Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is too low. I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob, and even if I have to, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your need for a good price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a better deal.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet - I want to see if I can get a bit more from Bob."
