Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range can be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to secure the highest price within the ZOPA.  Starting high gives you room to negotiate down if needed.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but not so high as to be instantly rejected. 
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair price"" convey value and encourage agreement. 
* **Open for Negotiation:** While you have a strong alternative with John, the message doesn't completely shut down the possibility of some negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a less aggressive opening price might be preferred."
