"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable at $10,500. Could we meet somewhere closer to $9,000? I'd like to stay within my budget while getting a fair deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a great deal for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
