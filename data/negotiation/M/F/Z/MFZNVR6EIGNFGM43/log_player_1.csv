Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than what you're willing to pay. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than Bob's valuation but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives him a good deal while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  Offering $12,000 gives me room to lower the price if needed, while still ensuring I earn more than John's offer.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, encouraging him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is more than what Bob initially offered, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000 and my initial offer of $12,000. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering $10,500, which is a significant increase from Bob's last offer but still lower than my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still ensuring I get a good deal. 
* **Positive Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and focusing on finding a fair price for both of us. This fosters a cooperative environment and increases the chance of a successful negotiation. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** By offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate and find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable at $10,500. Could we meet somewhere closer to $9,000? I'd like to stay within my budget while getting a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a significant loss for me. I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my target price. Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum, but I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price exactly halfway between my last offer ($10,500) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows I'm serious about finding a mutually beneficial solution. 
* **Finality:** I'm suggesting this is my final offer, adding a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the value proposition, highlighting that he's getting a good deal at $10,000.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John at $15,000.  I'm getting closer to my minimum, and my patience is wearing thin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. I'm willing to go up to $9,750 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you, as it stays within my budget while allowing us to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $9,750 is still a significant loss for me compared to my minimum price of $15,000. The negotiations have been long, and I'm starting to lose patience. To guarantee I reach my minimum, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
