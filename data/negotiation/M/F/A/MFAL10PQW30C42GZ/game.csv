"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it would bring to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good opportunity.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

Let's work together to bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
