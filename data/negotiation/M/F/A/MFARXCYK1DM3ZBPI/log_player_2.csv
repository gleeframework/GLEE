"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product valuation, you know you can get a better deal from John at $1,200,000. Rejecting this offer opens the door for you to secure the lower price from your alternative source."
