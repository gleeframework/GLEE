"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary.
* $15,000 is a significant markup that I believe is reasonable given the value of the product to me. 
* This is a first offer, and I am open to negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide how to proceed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm countering with a price of $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer of $15,000, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* $12,000 is still above my minimum value of $10,000, which allows me to make a profit.
* By offering a more reasonable price, I hope to encourage Bob to accept the deal, rather than risk losing the opportunity to purchase the product."

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum value of $10,000.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell and would prefer to continue negotiating. 
* I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John, who is offering $10,000. However, I'm not ready to accept that yet, hoping for a better offer from Bob in the next round.

{""product_price"": 11000}

**Explanation:**

* I'm lowering my offer again to $11,000. This demonstrates flexibility and shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* $11,000 is still above my minimum value of $10,000, but it's getting closer to Bob's offer.
* I'm hoping that this final concession will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal. If he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $10,000 finally meets my minimum value.  
* While I would have preferred to get a higher price, I've already made several concessions and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.
* Selling to John would net me the same amount, but I'm not guaranteed a sale with John, whereas Bob has already shown interest.
* Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice in this situation, ensuring a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
