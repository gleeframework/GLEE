Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. It's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but I think it's a fair starting point.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's better than selling to John.  I'll take it."
