"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $950,000 is still a lot higher than Alice's value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a price that is as close to Alice's minimum value as possible, while still leaving some room for negotiation.  $850,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate, while still being a reasonable price for a product worth $1,000,000 to Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's desired price and even higher than her previous offer.  Bob should continue negotiating to try to get a better price.  There's still room to bargain before resorting to buying from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to Alice's initial offer, demonstrating flexibility.  However, he's still significantly below the $975,000 offered by Alice. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and allows both parties to potentially find a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price. Buying from John at this point would be more expensive, and there's still potential to reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his last offer and Alice's current offer, while staying under the $950,000 mark of Alice's initial offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. It's important to keep the negotiation moving without getting too aggressive, as Alice might become unwilling to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $955,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's desired price, but it is very close to the $950,000 she offered initially. Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better price, and there's a risk Alice might become unwilling to negotiate further.  Buying from John at this point would be more expensive, and with only a few rounds remaining, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is still within Bob's budget and achieves a decent savings."
