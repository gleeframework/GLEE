Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is my first offer. It's a bit above my minimum price of $150 to see if Bob is interested and to give him some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $175. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price and I'm happy to take it. It's better than selling to John for $150."
