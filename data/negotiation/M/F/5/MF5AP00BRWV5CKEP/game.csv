"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This still leaves some room for you to get a great deal, while allowing me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to get closer to my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our current offers.",9500.0,Bob,4,
