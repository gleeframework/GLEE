This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Meeting your baseline:** Bob's offer of $12,000 matches your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Potential for losing the deal:**  Continuing to push for more could backfire. Bob might walk away, leaving you to sell to John at your minimum.
* **Time invested:** You've already spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting now avoids further time investment and potential frustration."
