"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's valuation but gives him room to negotiate.  I'm hoping to entice him to accept, but if he rejects, I have room to lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  $1,300,000 is still below my minimum valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,550,000. This is still a bit above Bob's valuation, but it's closer to my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm also mindful that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000.  There's no guarantee that Bob will continue to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,450,000.  This is closer to Bob's last offer, but still slightly above his valuation. I'm hoping to close the deal this round, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not the ideal price, it's above my minimum valuation and I'm running out of rounds.  It's also possible that Bob won't increase his offer further.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk getting a lower price or having to sell to John for $1,500,000."
