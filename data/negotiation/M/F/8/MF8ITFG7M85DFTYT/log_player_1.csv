Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Starting High:**  Starting with a higher price ($150) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Potential for Higher Gain:** There's a chance Bob values the product more than he's letting on or is willing to pay a premium for convenience.  

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always propose a lower price, gradually approaching your minimum acceptable price of $100."
