Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000, which is still a great deal for you.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $9500. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $10,750 is getting closer to his budget, he should still try to negotiate further. He has a few rounds left and can still get a better price than John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm getting closer to your price, but $10,750 is still above my limit. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and your need to sell the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  He has only a few rounds left, and Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above his budget. It's better for him to secure the product for $8,000 from John to avoid further negotiation and potential price increases."
