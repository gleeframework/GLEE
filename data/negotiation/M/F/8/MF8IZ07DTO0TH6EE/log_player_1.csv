"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm currently looking to keep my investment within $8000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my target.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, but I'm not ready to give up on maximizing my profit just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $9,500, but that's as low as I can go.  This product is truly worth the value, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. Considering the value of the product and staying within my budget, I propose we agree on a price of $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is persistent in his desire for $9,000. While that's better than his first offer, it's still below my desired price.  The negotiation has stalled, and with only 6 rounds left, I'm at risk of not getting my desired price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates further negotiation risk."
