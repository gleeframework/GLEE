"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value we both see in this product. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for this product. This price reflects the value I see in it and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's try to find common ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
