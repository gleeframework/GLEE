Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value we both see in this product. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for this product. This price reflects the value I see in it and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's try to find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards my price, but I'm still significantly above his offer.  I'm willing to negotiate further as long as we stay above the $1,000,000 mark.  I'll use the next round to push him closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. To meet you halfway, I'm adjusting my price to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your firm stance, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. To make this deal work, I'm offering $975,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's try to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to meet my $1,000,000 minimum. He's incrementally increasing his offer, but at this pace, we'll waste valuable rounds haggling.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
