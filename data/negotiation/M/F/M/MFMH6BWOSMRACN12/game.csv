"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the value to both of us, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  To demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget. Let's work together to finalize this.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's aim for a price that works well for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000 for the product?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
