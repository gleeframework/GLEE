Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm looking to get $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. It's a starting point to see if Bob is interested and how much he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That's still a good deal for you and closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 102.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $102.50 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer more, it's a good compromise and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
