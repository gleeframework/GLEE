Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, trying to sell to Bob first at a higher price could lead to a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves me with a good profit margin if he accepts. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a firm offer, the slightly higher price leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, allowing me to potentially earn even closer to my $10,000 minimum."
