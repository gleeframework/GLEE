"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,100,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering its potential worth to your operations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice's position, but I need to stick to my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
