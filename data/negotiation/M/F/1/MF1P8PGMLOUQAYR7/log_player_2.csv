"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice before going to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still outside of his ideal range. It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since John is offering the product for $8,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $9,000. I've already compromised a lot by coming down to $12,000, and I'm not willing to give up more. I'm willing to make one more offer: $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy from John. Alice has come down to $11,000, but that's still above Bob's ideal price. Since John is selling for $8,000, it's better for Bob to go with the guaranteed lower price, even if it means losing out on the chance to negotiate further with Alice."
