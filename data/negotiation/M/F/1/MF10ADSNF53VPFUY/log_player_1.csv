Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it presents significant value, and this offer reflects a fair price point."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's always beneficial to explore if I can get a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,500 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum acceptable price.

**This strategy aims to:**

1. **Secure the highest possible price from Bob.**
2. **Maintain the option to sell to John at $15,000 if Bob rejects the offer.**"
