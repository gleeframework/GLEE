"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
 
This is a good starting point. You want to save as much money as you can, and $1,200,000 is way above your target of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. What do you think?

While $1,050,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your target of $800,000.  There's still room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
