"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,,
