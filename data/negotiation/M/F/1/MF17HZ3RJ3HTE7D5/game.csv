"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now. Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $85, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $85 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $90. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if you're interested.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I'm willing to offer you $87.50, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  It's a fair compromise and hopefully a good price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $87.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $87.50, which would be $88.75. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if you're interested.",88.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $88.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88, which is a fair compromise and a significant reduction from your previous offer.  This would allow me to close the deal with you, and you'd still get a great price.  Let me know what you think.",88.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $88. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $89. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if you're interested.",89.0,Alice,9,
