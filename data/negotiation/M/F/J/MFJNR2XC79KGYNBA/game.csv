"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the competitive pricing, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,000 for the product? This would still allow you to make a good profit, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $10,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I'm still looking for a price closer to $10,000.  Would you consider $10,500? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,500. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $11,400. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I'm getting closer to my target,  $11,400 is still a bit higher than I'd like.  How about $10,900?  This would be a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a price that would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10900.0,Bob,6,
