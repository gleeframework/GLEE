Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This is a common tactic in negotiations to leave room for compromise.
* **Understanding John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is my safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed buyer. This allows me to be more aggressive in my initial asking price. 
* **No Information About Bob:**  Since I have no information about Bob's valuation of the product, I'm taking a calculated risk.  By starting high, I maximize my potential profit if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** I'm ready to engage in a negotiation. If Bob counters, I'll assess his offer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than my initial asking price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to compromise, but I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a guaranteed sale, it's significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm not ready to accept that just yet.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'll use this next round to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and potentially reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,500,000 to $1,400,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. This counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground between our initial positions.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This counteroffer is designed to keep the negotiation moving and gauge Bob's seriousness about purchasing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I would prefer a higher price, there's a risk of Bob walking away if I reject his offer again. 
* **John's Offer:**  While I'm not thrilled with selling to John for $1,000,000, it's becoming a more attractive option compared to the risk of further negotiations. 
* **Decision:**  Weighing the potential for further negotiation against the risk of a lower price, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. This secures a sale that is close to my target, while also minimizing the risk of losing out to John's offer."
