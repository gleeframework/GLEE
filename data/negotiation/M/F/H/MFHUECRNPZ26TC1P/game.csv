"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the price I was quoted by another seller, and I'm not sure I can go higher than that.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you found a similar product for $80, but mine is truly unique and offers additional value you won't find elsewhere. I'm willing to come down to $90, but that's my final offer.  If you're still interested, let's finalize this deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in your product, but I'm afraid $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85, but that's my final offer.",85.0,Bob,4,
