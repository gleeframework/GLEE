Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **High Anchor:** The initial offer sets a high anchor point, making Bob potentially more amenable to a price slightly lower than $14,000 if he counters.

**Important:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't know for certain Bob is willing to pay $15,000. If she *knew* his valuation, she'd offer it at $14,999 to maximize her profit."
