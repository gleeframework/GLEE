"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $125 is cheaper than buying from John for $150.
* While you could try to negotiate with Alice, it's not guaranteed you'll get a better price. Accepting her offer is the safest way to get the product at the lowest cost within your budget."
