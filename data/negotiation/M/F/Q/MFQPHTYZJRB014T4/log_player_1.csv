Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further but selling to John for $800,000 is still on the table if I don't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $850,000?  This would still leave you with a good profit margin.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial goal. I'll counteroffer again.  John is always an option, but I want to see if we can reach a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal soon. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? This would be a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's a fair deal, and it's better than selling to John for the same price.  I'll accept this offer and finalize the sale."
