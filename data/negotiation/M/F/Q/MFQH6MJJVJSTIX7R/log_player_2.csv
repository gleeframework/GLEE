{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is getting closer to your desired price point.  While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher cost. It's a reasonable price given the progress you've made in the negotiation. Accepting this offer allows you to save a significant amount compared to buying from John, with a good chance of getting a better price in future rounds."
