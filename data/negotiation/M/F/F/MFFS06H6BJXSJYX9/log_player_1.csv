"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I appreciate his interest, $9,800 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $10,250 is still less than what I'd like, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and a better deal than selling to John. Let's close this deal!"
