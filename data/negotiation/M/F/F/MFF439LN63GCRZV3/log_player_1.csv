Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it leaves some room for negotiation while still securing a good price for me. I'm also highlighting the value Bob will get from the product to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
