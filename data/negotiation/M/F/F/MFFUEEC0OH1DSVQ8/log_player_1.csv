Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay up to $80, so $100 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  You're not selling below your minimum value of $120 right away, giving you room to negotiate downwards.
* **It's a friendly message:**  Starting with a friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $80. Would you be willing to meet me at $85?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

While $85 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.  I'll see if I can get him to budge a little higher."
