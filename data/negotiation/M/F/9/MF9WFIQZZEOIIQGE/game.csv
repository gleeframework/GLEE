"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details further. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10000. ",15000.0,Alice,1,
