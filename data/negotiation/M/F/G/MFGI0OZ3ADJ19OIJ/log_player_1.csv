Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. It's still a great deal for me, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  While I can sell to John for $8,000, I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $10,000.  Let's see if I can convince Bob to come up a bit!"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $8,000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $8500? It's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push it to $9,000. If that fails, I'll consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  I'm still a bit away from your offer. How about $8,750?  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to being comfortable with the price. How about $8250? It's a bit lower than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While I'm getting closer to a deal with Bob, the negotiation seems to be dragging on, and I'm not sure I can get to my desired price. It's better to secure the $8,000 sale with John now rather than risk getting stuck in a long negotiation and ending up with less."
