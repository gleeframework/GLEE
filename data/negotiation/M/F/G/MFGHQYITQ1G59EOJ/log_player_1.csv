"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $1000000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum acceptable price, I'm not keen on giving up any more of the potential profit. I believe I can get closer to my desired price in further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This represents a fair compromise, considering the value this product will bring to your business.  Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $1100000 is still a bit too high.  I'm prepared to pay $1050000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's aim for a win-win here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's slightly lower than my ideal price, it's a fair compromise and ensures I sell the product without risking the deal falling apart.  I can still make a decent profit, and it's likely that further negotiation will lead to more back and forth without guaranteeing a better outcome."
