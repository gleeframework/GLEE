"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $80 is below my minimum, and I think I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $90 for the product. Can you meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I have a few more rounds and John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not in a rush to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $98. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $98 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $92 for the product. Can you meet me at $95 is too high, how about $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This time, I'm going to sell to John.  Bob has already offered a price lower than my minimum, and I'm not confident I can get him to budge any higher.  While it would be nice to make a bit more, John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether."
