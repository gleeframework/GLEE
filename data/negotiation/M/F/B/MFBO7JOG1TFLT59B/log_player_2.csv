"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting significantly lower than Alice's offer and your maximum budget, you create room for negotiation and signal that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Staying Above Alice's Value:**  Offering $110 ensures you're still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($120), giving her an incentive to continue the negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer allows you to potentially secure a very favorable price while leaving you space to increase your offer slightly if Alice rejects it, keeping you well below John's $150 alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think it's a bit pricey, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Would you be interested in that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to your desired price range, $130 is still above your ideal spending limit. You have room to negotiate further, especially since John's offer acts as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $120? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while staying firm on your budget. 
* **Sweet Spot:**  $120 hits Alice's estimated value for the product, giving her a strong incentive to accept.
* **Time Pressure:** By expressing your readiness to buy immediately, you add a subtle pressure for Alice to accept and close the deal."
