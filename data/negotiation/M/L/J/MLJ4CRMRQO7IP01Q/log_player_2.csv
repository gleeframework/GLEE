{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer.  It's a bold move, but it aims to set a lower bar for the negotiation and hopefully incentivize Alice to come down in price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still higher than your ideal price.  There's room to negotiate further, and you have a better chance of getting a lower price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}

Alice has already lowered her price, demonstrating some flexibility.  This counteroffer increases the initial offer by $100,000, showing you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your ideal target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000. Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous option. While further negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and ending up with John's higher price outweighs the potential savings."
