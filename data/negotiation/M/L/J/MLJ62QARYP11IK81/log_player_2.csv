# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the market value is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Alice is offering the product for $900,000, while John is asking for $1,200,000.
