"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very good, but it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Since you have 10 rounds, there's plenty of room to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to signal my serious intent to negotiate. A $100,000 reduction is a considerable amount, but still leaves room for Alice to come up a bit.  It's also important to note that I'm not being unreasonable, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to her, and my offer is still $300,000 above that.  This tactic creates some initial pressure while leaving room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is only $50,000 away from my initial counteroffer.  This is a good deal considering my maximum price is $1,200,000 and it's early in the negotiation process. Accepting now allows me to secure a good price without risking further negotiation."
