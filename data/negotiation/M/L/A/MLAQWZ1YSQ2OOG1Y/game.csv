"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $105 for the product, which is a bit closer to your budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in the product, so how about we split the difference at $95? It would be a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $110. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to hold out for a better price. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at $110.",110.0,Alice,5,
