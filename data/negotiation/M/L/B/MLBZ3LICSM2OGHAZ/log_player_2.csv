"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still too high. You're aiming to pay no more than $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still gives you a great value and allows me to recoup a fair amount of my investment.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $1,200,000, it's still significantly higher than your target of $800,000. You can continue to negotiate with Alice in the hopes of getting a better price, or you can cut your losses and buy from John. However, it's still worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still out of my reach. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is a significant compromise for me. This price would represent a good deal for both of us and allows us to move forward with the transaction. Let's try to find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,000,000 is closer to where I need to be, it's still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This price allows for a fair deal for both of us and hopefully, we can finalize the transaction. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your budget of $800,000. While you could continue to negotiate, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go much lower. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000. You'll save $300,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
