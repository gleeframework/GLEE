Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to make a significant profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
