"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to make a significant profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still gives you a great value and allows me to recoup a fair amount of my investment.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still out of my reach. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is a significant compromise for me. This price would represent a good deal for both of us and allows us to move forward with the transaction. Let's try to find common ground at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,000,000 is closer to where I need to be, it's still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This price allows for a fair deal for both of us and hopefully, we can finalize the transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
