"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $13,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $12,250. This price still gives me a good return while being within your range. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. Bob should try to negotiate further to see if he can get a better deal. There are still rounds left, so it's worth exploring more options before committing to a price above his initial target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This price would allow us both to close a deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
