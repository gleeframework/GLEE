"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a fair value for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,,
