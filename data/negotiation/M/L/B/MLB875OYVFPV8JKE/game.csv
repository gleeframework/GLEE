"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product if we can meet in the middle.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I must respectfully decline. My company has invested significantly in the production and quality assurance of this product. At $75, it would not allow us to cover our costs and sustain our business. I am open to discussing other terms or finding a solution that could benefit both of us. Here's a revised offer: if you're interested, I can consider selling the product for $85. This price still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being competitive in the market.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $82. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm really interested in purchasing the product, and I think it's a great value at the right price.",82.0,Bob,4,
