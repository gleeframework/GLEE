Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I must respectfully decline. My company has invested significantly in the production and quality assurance of this product. At $75, it would not allow us to cover our costs and sustain our business. I am open to discussing other terms or finding a solution that could benefit both of us. Here's a revised offer: if you're interested, I can consider selling the product for $85. This price still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being competitive in the market.
