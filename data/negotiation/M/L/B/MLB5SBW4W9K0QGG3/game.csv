"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product today. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start, I propose a price of $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This seems like a fair price considering both of our positions.",10500.0,Bob,4,
