"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you're excited about the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to consider $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little high for me.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can close the deal at this price.",105.0,Bob,4,
