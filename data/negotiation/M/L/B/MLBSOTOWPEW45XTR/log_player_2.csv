Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $12000 is a good offer, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $13500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still over his ideal price point. He should continue to negotiate with Alice in an attempt to get closer to his desired price."
