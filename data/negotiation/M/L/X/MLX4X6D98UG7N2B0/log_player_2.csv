"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,100,000, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer in this direction, so I hope we can meet in the middle at last. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're tough! I do value my time though, and I feel like we're getting close.  How about we agree on $1,000,000 even and call it a day?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $1,000,000. I've already received a better offer from another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000, and this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a tough one, but it's time to cut my losses.  Alice seems firm on her price, and it's better to secure the product at $1,050,000 than risk losing it and having to buy from John at $1,500,000."
