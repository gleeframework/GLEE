Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000, and this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
