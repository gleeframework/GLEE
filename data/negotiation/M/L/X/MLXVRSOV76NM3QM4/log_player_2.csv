"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate further. You can likely get a better price than $950,000, especially since Alice is willing to sell for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer offers a significant discount from Alice's initial price while still being a reasonable amount. It allows for room for negotiation and hopefully encourages Alice to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved closer to your initial counteroffer.  Accepting this offer saves you $75,000 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your offer again and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it."
