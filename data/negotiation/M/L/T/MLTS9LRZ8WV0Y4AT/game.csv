Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you.,120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the value of the product, $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's still a great deal considering its value to you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  If you're not willing to go that low, I may have to consider John's offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $105. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is John's price. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.",100.0,Bob,6,
