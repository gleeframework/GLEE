"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 
 
I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob a reasonable starting point for negotiation, while still allowing me to potentially make a decent profit. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price if needed, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $175. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a more reasonable price than Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push Bob higher.  There's a chance he might be willing to meet me halfway, and I'd still be making a good profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $160. I'm starting to feel the pressure as rounds are passing, but I'm still holding out for a better price.  It's important to stay firm, but also be willing to compromise a little. I believe this is a reasonable price for both of us."
