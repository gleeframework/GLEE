"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $14,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see you're willing to pay a bit more than your initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting close!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further. How about $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
