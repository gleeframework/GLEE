"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer positively to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Room for negotiation:** $120 leaves ample space for both of us to find a mutually agreeable price within the next 9 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, and $100 is still significantly lower than that.
* **Negotiation Value:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Time Remaining:** I have 8 rounds left, which is ample time to find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by reducing my price, but not by much.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly pressuring him to meet me halfway.
* **Time Management:**  While I want a good price, I'm also aware of the limited rounds and need to make progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Bob's offer is steadily increasing, and we are nearing a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We are now in round 4, and with limited rounds remaining, accepting his offer guarantees a sale. 
* **Value vs. Risk:**  $105 is significantly higher than what John is offering, and there's no guarantee I can achieve a better price with more rounds.  It's a good balance of value and minimizing risk."
