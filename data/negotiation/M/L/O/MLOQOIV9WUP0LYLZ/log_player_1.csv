"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is still a substantial investment for me and reflects the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm also confident in the future value of this product.  How about we meet halfway at $1,250,000? This would still be a great deal for you in the long run."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $1,000,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at his valuation, but we still have negotiating room and time.  I'll try to nudge him a bit higher before accepting his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your firmness, but I need to see a little more movement on your end to make this deal worthwhile for me. How about $1,125,000? That's my final offer."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a good price, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,125,000 is still outside my budget.  I can offer $1,050,000.  This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has finally moved from his original offer, and we're getting close to the halfway point of the negotiation. Accepting $1,050,000 secures a profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
