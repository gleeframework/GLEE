"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand $750,000 is your preferred price, it's below my minimum for this item.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000, so I'm offering $800,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",800000.0,Bob,4,
