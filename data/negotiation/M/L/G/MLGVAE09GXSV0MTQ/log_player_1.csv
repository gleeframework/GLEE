"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to Bob, but I want to see his reaction and gauge his interest level.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000. I want to see if I can push for a better price. 

I'm confident I can get closer to my goal by continuing the negotiation. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than $750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $950,000, which is still a good profit for me. This shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible but I'm also not giving away the product for cheap. This should encourage him to consider my offer seriously, especially since he knows I have a backup buyer at $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price,  $825,000 is a good deal, exceeding my minimum value of $800,000.  There's a chance I could push for more, but the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and potentially lowering his offer again is too high.  I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
