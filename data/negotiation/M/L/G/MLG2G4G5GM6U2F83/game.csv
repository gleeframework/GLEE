"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but I believe the price could be more competitive. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is still significant. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the price is still a bit high for me. Could you consider $950,000?  I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value it brings while working with my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  To be completely transparent, I'm trying to keep my budget under $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there at $990,000? I'm ready to close the deal if so.",990000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $990,000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, and I'm proposing a price of $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.
