{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* $18,000 is far above your budget of $10,000. 
* There's no reason to accept the offer at this point.
* You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for a much lower price, so it makes sense to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  
*  This counteroffer is still within my budget, but it gives Alice some room to negotiate. 
*  I'm hoping to get a price closer to my ideal $10,000, but I'm willing to compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* While $16,000 is a better offer than her first one, it's still above my budget. 
* I have more rounds left, and I can still buy from John for a lower price, so it makes sense to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer, but still staying below my $10,000 limit.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* While $16,500 is a slight improvement, it's still above my budget. 
* I have more rounds to negotiate, and I'm close to my $10,000 limit from John.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

* I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to accept this offer, or we can reach a deal in the next few rounds."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is not coming down enough in price. 
* We are running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk her making a counteroffer that is even higher than her last offer.
* It's better to secure the product from John at $10,000, even though I was hoping to save more."
