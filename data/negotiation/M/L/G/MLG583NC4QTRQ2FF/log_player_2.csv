"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. It's closer to her value than mine. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle during the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product but $80 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $105 is still more than I want to pay.  I'll counteroffer a bit higher than my last offer to show I'm willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. How about $90? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $90 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. This is a great deal for you, and we can finalize this quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now very close to my maximum price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll dig in or that we'll waste rounds going back and forth. Accepting at $95 gets me the product for a price I'm comfortable with."
