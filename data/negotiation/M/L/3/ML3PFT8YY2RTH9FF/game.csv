"Hi Bob, I have a unique product I'm offering for sale.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. I'm initially offering it for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, Thanks for your interest! While $8000 is a bit low for me, I appreciate your offer.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $12000? It's still a good deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. ",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12000 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway.  How about $10000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10000 is still a little low for me, but I'm open to finding a compromise. How about $11000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $10500.  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,6,
