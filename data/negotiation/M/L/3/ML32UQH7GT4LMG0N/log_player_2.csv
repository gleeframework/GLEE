"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to me, so accepting Alice's offer of $20,000 is not a good idea. I will reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, hoping to get a good deal early on. I'm offering $10,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows my strong interest in the product but also my budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum price point. I'll reject Alice's offer again and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

Since Alice is still above my budget, I'm increasing my offer to $11,000, showing I'm willing to compromise but still need to stay below my maximum price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,500 is getting closer, it's still above my budget. I'll reject this offer and try to get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm now offering my maximum price of $12,000. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be better off buying from John. This is a clear indication of my final stance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is still too high with her price. Even though I'm running out of rounds, it's not worth it to risk getting stuck with a price higher than my maximum. It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John."
