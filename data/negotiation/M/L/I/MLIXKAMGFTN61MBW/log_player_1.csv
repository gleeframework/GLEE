"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The price is also below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, indicating I'm open to a deal.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential benefits for Bob. This can encourage him to engage.

**Strategy:**

By starting high but still being open to negotiation, I hope to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. This will give me more information about his willingness to pay and allow me to gauge whether I can close the deal within the 10 rounds or if it's better to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **There's still room to negotiate:**  I believe I can likely get a better price from Bob. He's shown interest and is willing to negotiate.
* **More information needed:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can gauge his true maximum price point with a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, aiming to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This price still allows for a good return for me and a fair deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and Bob's offer ($1,400,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive and reassuring tone:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is a good deal for both of us.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than his initial offer, making the counteroffer seem more reasonable.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that by offering a compromise, I can push Bob closer to my desired price range and potentially close the deal within the remaining rounds. If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his maximum price point for future counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,550,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,450,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  There are still rounds left, and Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate. I believe I can get closer to my target price.
* **Testing Bob's limits:** By rejecting his offer, I can further gauge how far he's willing to go.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer again, moving closer to my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation. My goal is to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible while still keeping the deal alive with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,450,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's try $1,525,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our needs. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1525000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my minimum:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing flexibility while staying within my acceptable range.
* **Focusing on fairness:** I emphasize ""fair compromise"" and ""great deal"" to appeal to Bob's sense of value.
* **Highlighting benefits for both:** I reiterate the deal's benefits for both of us, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is designed to subtly pressure Bob to accept. I'm hoping to push him just past his perceived value of $1,000,000 while still staying above my minimum. If he rejects, I'll need to assess if I should continue negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,525,000. I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I think $1,475,000 is the highest I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,475,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited time:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and I need to ensure I get a price that meets my needs. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob has shown a willingness to go up, indicating there's room for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer one last time, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. If he rejects, I'll need to weigh the remaining rounds against the certainty of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up, but $1,475,000 is still a little too low for me.  Considering the value of this product and our ongoing negotiations, how about we settle at $1,495,000? It's a small step for you, but it gets us closer to a deal.  I'm confident you'll agree that this price reflects the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1495000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This is my last counteroffer before potentially moving on to John. 
* **Small increase:** The offer is only $20,000 higher than Bob's last offer, making it seem like a minor adjustment. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the product's worth and highlight the value of a successful negotiation for both of us. 

**Strategy:**

This offer is designed to push Bob to accept, as he's shown a willingness to negotiate. However, if he rejects, I'll likely move on to John to secure the $1,500,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,495,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,462,500? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,462,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,462,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** We have only three rounds left, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **No clear path to agreement:**  While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, his offers haven't gotten close enough to my desired price point.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me the full $1,500,000, which is more than I'm likely to get from Bob with the remaining time.

**Strategy:**

The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high. I'm losing valuable time, and there's no guarantee I can reach a price that meets my minimum. Selling to John ensures a profitable outcome with less risk."
