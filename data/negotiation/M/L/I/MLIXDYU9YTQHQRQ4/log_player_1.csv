Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum ($8,000) but still leaves room for bargaining. It also conveys a friendly and positive tone, hoping to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, you still have room to negotiate and try to get closer to your desired price. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500?  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $8,200 is only $200 less than what John is willing to pay. This is a good deal, and it's likely that further negotiation with Bob won't yield a significantly higher price. Accepting the offer maximizes my profit at this point."
