"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000. I'm willing to throw in some extras, such as a special warranty and personalized support, to sweeten the deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider it?",10500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000.

This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,7,
