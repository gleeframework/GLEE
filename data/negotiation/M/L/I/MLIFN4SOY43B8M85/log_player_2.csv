"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $14,000.  The product is only worth $10,000 to Alice, meaning there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $12,000, which is still above Alice's value of $10,000, giving her an incentive to sell. This is a significant drop from her initial offer, and it shows that I'm serious about negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good deal. It's lower than my initial counteroffer, but still within my budget. I could try to negotiate further, but there's a risk she'll reject again, and then I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
