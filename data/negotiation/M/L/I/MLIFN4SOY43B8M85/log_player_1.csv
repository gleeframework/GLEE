Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for a profit and $14,000 ensures you're making at least $4,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth $15,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more than $14,000.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A very high opening offer might make Bob less likely to negotiate.

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below the price we'd like to get. There's room for a counter-offer to get closer to the value we know Bob is willing to pay.  We'll try to get something closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

We're splitting the difference between our initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. This shows willingness to compromise while still getting a price that's closer to what we want."
