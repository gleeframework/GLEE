"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, close to the value Bob places on the product. This allows me to maximize potential profit, but also leaves room for negotiation. I am confident that Bob will counter, as he values the product higher than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm also showing flexibility to ensure we reach an agreement. This should encourage Bob to accept the offer or come back with a counteroffer closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,120,000 is very close to my desired price.  While I could try to push for a bit more, there's a good chance that further negotiation will only lead to a lower price or a stalemate. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
