# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price.  There's no benefit to rejecting and buying from John, as the price is the same.  You might as well buy from Alice."
