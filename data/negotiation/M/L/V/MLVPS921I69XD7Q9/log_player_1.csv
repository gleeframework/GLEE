{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  This leaves room for negotiation without sacrificing your minimum profit. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This sets the stage for a productive conversation. 

I'll be ready to respond to Bob's counteroffer or accept his offer if he agrees. If we don't reach an agreement, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $12,000.  Bob's offer isn't a good deal for me. 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a compromise before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to save money, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm sticking to a price that's still above Bob's initial offer, but I'm showing willingness to compromise. This counteroffer signals my seriousness in selling to Bob, but also protects my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,250 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. It's only $250 away from my last offer, so a counteroffer might be a better approach. I'll make a final counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your persistence. While $9,250 is getting closer, I'm still going to need a bit more to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference once more -  $9,375. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9375} 
``` 

This counteroffer offers a compromise that's close to Bob's last offer while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum.  This is a final offer, leaving no room for further negotiation. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but $9,375 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but I really need to stay within my budget of $8,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $12,000.  I've already offered several compromises, but he hasn't met me halfway. I don't want to risk further negotiations that might result in a lower price. 

It's time to move on and sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
