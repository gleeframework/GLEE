"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Can you meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to save money, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your persistence. While $9,250 is getting closer, I'm still going to need a bit more to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference once more -  $9,375. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. ",9375.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but $9,375 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but I really need to stay within my budget of $8,000. Can you meet me at this price?",9200.0,Bob,6,
