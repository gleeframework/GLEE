"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for your business. My initial price is $2,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my business.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer.  While I acknowledge your perspective on its value,  $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, which still allows for a substantial margin for your business.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value it will bring to my business.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  However, $1,400,000 is still below the value I've placed on this product.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000. This leaves room for you to generate a good return and keeps me close to my minimum price.  Let's find common ground on this figure.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
