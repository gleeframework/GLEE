,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This price is closer to my budget and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere.  I've already lowered my price significantly. I'm only willing to go down to $1,050,000. If you're serious about acquiring this product, this is our final offer.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is the highest price I can afford, and it reflects the value I place on it.  I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement to close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
