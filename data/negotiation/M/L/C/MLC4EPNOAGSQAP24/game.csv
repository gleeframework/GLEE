"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  After careful consideration, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its significant value and potential for your business.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and understand your budget constraints.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues what it brings to the table.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,000,000.  This is a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to reach $1,000,000.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and closer to your position.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $975,000. This is a very competitive price and reflects the significant value this product brings. However, I need to be transparent â€“ I have another interested buyer.  So, I need you to be close to this number for us to make a deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $975,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal here.",950000.0,Bob,6,
