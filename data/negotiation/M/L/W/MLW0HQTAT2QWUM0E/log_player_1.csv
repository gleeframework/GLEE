**Reasoning:** 

Bob has been incredibly stubborn, returning to his $960,000 offer multiple times.  It's unlikely he'll move significantly from this price. At this point, the additional $5,000 we might squeeze out of him isn't worth the time and effort, especially when we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John."
