"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love.  I'm asking $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  How about $95? That's a fair bit closer to your price and I think it's a good deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference -  $110.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",110.0,Alice,5,
