"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100 maximum.
* Alice is offering it for $90, which is still within your budget.
* However, you can get the product for $100 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer means you can save $10."
