"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her own valuation ($1,300,000 vs. $800,000).  There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price.  While buying from John is a fallback option, there's a chance to get the product cheaper from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the true value you'll be gaining while still offering a fair deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. While there's less room to negotiate now, I can still try to push for a lower price. I'm not yet ready to accept a price that's close to John's offer."
