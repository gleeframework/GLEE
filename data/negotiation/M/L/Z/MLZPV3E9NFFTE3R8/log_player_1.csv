Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher than Bob's value:** $10,000 is more than the product is worth to Bob ($8,000), giving him some incentive to buy.
* **Lower than my minimum:** This price is still above my minimum of $12,000, ensuring I make a profit even if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room for Bob to negotiate, making him feel like he got a good deal.

This strategy maximizes my potential profit by giving Bob a tempting offer while still guaranteeing I get at least my minimum price."
