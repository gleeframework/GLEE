Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something you'll value highly."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximize Profit:** Offering the product for slightly less than Bob's maximum valuation ($95) creates a strong chance of acceptance. If Bob rejects this offer, you can still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to balance profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
