"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $12000? This would still give you a great deal on a valuable product, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,
