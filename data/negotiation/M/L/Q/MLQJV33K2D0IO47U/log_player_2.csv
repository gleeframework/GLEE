"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $130. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have the option to buy from John for $150. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to secure the sale."
