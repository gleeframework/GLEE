"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable value. This allows room for negotiation while still being profitable for me.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and optimistic, emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit.  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, but I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $15,000 mark if possible.  By starting high, I create leverage for negotiations and encourage Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired value and my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both of us, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low.  The possibility of selling to John for $15,000 gives me the leverage to hold firm in my negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and also the price John is willing to pay. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but emphasizing that I'm willing to compromise. I'm also reiterating the value of the product and suggesting a fair compromise. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to reach a mutually agreeable price as quickly as possible. By offering $15,000, I'm showing flexibility while still protecting my minimum profit margin. This approach also keeps the door open for a quick deal, reducing the risk of Bob getting frustrated and walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $13,500 is still below my target. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $15,000 at this point.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with another proposal. I'll try to find a compromise closer to my target while maintaining the leverage of selling to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $14,000, which is a compromise that's closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's concerns about his budget while emphasizing that the price is fair and represents a good value for him.  I'm also encouraging him to consider the deal.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground with Bob. I'm showing flexibility by decreasing my price, but I'm still holding out for a price that's profitable for me. I'm also keeping the pressure on by suggesting that this is a good deal for both of us,  prompting him to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my desired range.  I'm trying to find a compromise, but I won't settle for a price that's too low.  The option to sell to John for $15,000 gives me the leverage to hold firm in the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still willing to work with you, but $12,500 simply won't cover my costs.  Let's try $13,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $13,750, which is a compromise halfway between my last offer of $14,000 and Bob's current offer of $12,500.
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating my willingness to negotiate while emphasizing that I need to cover my costs. I'm framing the price as a fair compromise and suggesting that it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob. I'm showing flexibility by decreasing my price further, but I'm still trying to maintain a profit margin. By framing the offer as a ""fair price"" and highlighting the possibility of a mutually beneficial outcome, I'm encouraging Bob to reconsider his position and accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiations with Bob have stalled. His latest offer of $11,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and not reaching a deal is high.

**Strategy:**

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John for $15,000 than to risk a lower price with Bob or potentially no deal at all. I'm confident that John will buy the product at my desired price."
