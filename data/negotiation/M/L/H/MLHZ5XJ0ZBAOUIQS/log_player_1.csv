"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get a good starting point.  It's likely he'll counter, and we can then negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still lower than my initial asking price. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate to sell. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12200}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,200. This is a smaller increment than my previous offer, showing I'm getting closer to a compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will see that we're close to a deal and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, I'm starting to run out of time and rounds.  John's offer of $12,000 is my minimum, and I don't want to risk going lower and potentially losing out on a guaranteed sale.  It's time to sell to John."
