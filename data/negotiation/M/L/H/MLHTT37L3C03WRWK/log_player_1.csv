Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so starting near that value is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net.  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice still gets a decent price."
