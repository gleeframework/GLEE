Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe the product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually agreeable price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $1,300,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm excited about the product, but I have to think about my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

``` 

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and $1,300,000 is a solid profit above my minimum.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk pushing him away and potentially getting a lower offer later."
