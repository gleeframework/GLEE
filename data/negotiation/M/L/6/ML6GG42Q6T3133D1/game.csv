"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe the product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your budget considerations.  While $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway at $1,325,000? This reflects my desire to close this deal while acknowledging the value this product brings to your specific needs.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $1,300,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm excited about the product, but I have to think about my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
