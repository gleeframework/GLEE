"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. How about $110? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $110, while John is selling it for $150. 
* **You still save money:** Even though Alice's offer is above your ideal price, it's still a significant saving compared to buying from John."
