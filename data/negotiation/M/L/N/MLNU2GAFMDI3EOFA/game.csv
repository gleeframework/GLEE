"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,800 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make at least $9,200 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,200.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,3,
