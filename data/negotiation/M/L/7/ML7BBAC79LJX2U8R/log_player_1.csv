Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum value ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the product's potential value to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message clearly indicates that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counter if he wants to.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open.  If Bob counter-offers, I'll adjust my price based on his offer and my willingness to sell at that point. If he rejects my initial offer, I'll assess his counter-offer and decide whether to accept, counter-offer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($150).** While it's tempting to take the $120, it's below my floor.
* **Selling to John is still a viable option.**  John is willing to pay $150, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **There's room for negotiation.** I'm willing to counter-offer Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling my commitment to a higher price. I'll counter-offer at a price that's still attractive to Bob but closer to my minimum value. This keeps the negotiation going while protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:**  My counter-offer is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my minimum acceptable value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still protects my interests.
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:**  I use a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Bob to reconsider.

**Strategy:**

This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground. By being flexible but firm, I hope to entice Bob to accept, leading to a mutually beneficial outcome.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to carefully assess his next counter-offer and decide whether to accept, counter-offer again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value ($150).**  While it's closer than his initial offer, it's not enough for me to accept.
* **Selling to John is still the best option.**  John is willing to pay $150, which is more than what Bob is currently offering.
* **There's little room for further negotiation.** I've already lowered my price significantly from my initial offer, and another counter-offer could drag the negotiation further without a guarantee of a better outcome.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm choosing the most profitable option available. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable value and avoids further back-and-forth with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still hesitant about the price. To be completely honest,  $125 isn't quite enough for me. However, I want to make this work for both of us. If you're truly interested, I'd be willing to come down to $135. This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to either accept or walk away.
* **Slight Compromise:**  While still above Bob's offer, I've lowered the price to $135, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  I frame the offer as beneficial for both of us, highlighting the win-win aspect of the deal.

**Strategy:**

This counter-offer aims to get Bob closer to my minimum acceptable value without risking further negotiation rounds. I'm hoping that the finality of my offer and the emphasis on mutual benefit will persuade Bob to accept. If he rejects this offer, I'll proceed with selling to John."
