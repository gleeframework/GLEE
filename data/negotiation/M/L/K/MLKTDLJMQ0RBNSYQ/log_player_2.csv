# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $850,000. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1,100,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $925,000. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business.

Alice is unlikely to come down much further and is still trying to get a significantly higher price than John's offer. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the product at the best price."
