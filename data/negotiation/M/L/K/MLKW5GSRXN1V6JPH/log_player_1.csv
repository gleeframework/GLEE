"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profits.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I'm aiming for a significant profit margin. I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $16,000. This is still a good profit for me and hopefully a more palatable price for Bob, considering he offered $14,000.  We're getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $15,500. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it will be acceptable to Bob.  This should be close enough for Bob to accept, and I'm still within the range I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  We're nearing the end of the rounds, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower. I've made significant concessions, but he's still not willing to meet my expectations.  I'm confident I can achieve a better price with John, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower offer."
