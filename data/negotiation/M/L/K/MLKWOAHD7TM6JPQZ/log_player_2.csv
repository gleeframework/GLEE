"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it! Would you like to take it home for $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $180 is far above your $100 limit and even above what it's worth to her. Buying from John at $100 gets you the product at the best possible price."
