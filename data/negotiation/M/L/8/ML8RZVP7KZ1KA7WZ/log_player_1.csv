{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
