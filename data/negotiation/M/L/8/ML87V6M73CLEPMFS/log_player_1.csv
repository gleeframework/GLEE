Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price ($100) and it leaves room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, he might be willing to accept this offer.  If not, I'll be ready to counter his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm confident that Bob will see this as a fair price, considering he values the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $125 is still a good deal. It's above my minimum price and significantly higher than selling to John.  I'm willing to accept this to finalize the sale."
