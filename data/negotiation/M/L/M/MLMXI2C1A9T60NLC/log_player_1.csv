{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for bargaining. It's also lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving me flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,200 for your product. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,200 is closer to my target price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm confident that I can get my full asking price from John, so I'm going to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John."
