"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this valuable product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a unique item that will surely bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering the product for $11,500.  There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product.  While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I believe this price is fair, reflecting the value you've placed on the product and allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,000.**  This is still below Bob's maximum price of $12,000.
* **There's limited room for further negotiation.** Bob's last counteroffer of $10,500 was rejected.  Another counteroffer might be rejected again, leading to a potential impasse.
* **Buying from John would be more expensive.**  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John.

It's better for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product for a price within his budget."
