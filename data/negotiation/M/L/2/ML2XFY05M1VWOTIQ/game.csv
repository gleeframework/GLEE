"Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit too steep for me right now.  Would you consider $50?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $50 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, $50 is quite a jump. How about $70? That's closer to the middle ground.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $70 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement!",90.0,Alice,5,
