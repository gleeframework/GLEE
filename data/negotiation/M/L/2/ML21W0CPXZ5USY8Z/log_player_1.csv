Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I believe it will be a valuable asset to you, even more so than my minimum asking price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($8,000) as possible without going below her minimum ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price that's still very profitable for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John, so she can be firm with Bob.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit from Bob while having a safety net with John."
