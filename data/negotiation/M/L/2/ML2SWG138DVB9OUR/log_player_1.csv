Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This allows room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and even less than what John is willing to pay. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130, which is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his range. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still ensuring I get a fair profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $115 isn't my ideal price, it's close to my minimum acceptable price and higher than what John is offering. It's also a clear sign that Bob is willing to negotiate further, which suggests he values the product. Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
