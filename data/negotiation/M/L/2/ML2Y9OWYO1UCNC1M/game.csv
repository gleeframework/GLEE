"Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product. However, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is the maximum I'm able to spend. Let me know if this price works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the product's worth. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $16000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10000, which is a fair price that's closer to my budget and allows for some profit for you. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. Considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the product's worth. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
