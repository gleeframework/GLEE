"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $8,000, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.
