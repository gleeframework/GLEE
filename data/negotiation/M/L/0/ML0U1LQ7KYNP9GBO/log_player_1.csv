``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant discount for Bob but still allows me to make a profit well above my minimum of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still getting a decent profit."
