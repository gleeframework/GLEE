You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is offering $95. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price, as you can potentially get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $90 is still within your budget of $100 and is better than John's price of $100.  There's a chance you could negotiate further, but the risk of losing the deal altogether isn't worth it at this point."
