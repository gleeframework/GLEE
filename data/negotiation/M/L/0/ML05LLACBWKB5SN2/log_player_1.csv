Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, but still ensures a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Starting too low might make Bob think the product is low quality or make him unwilling to negotiate.
* **Secure a Sale:** While you have John as a backup, selling to Bob at $119 is a better outcome than selling to John for $100."
