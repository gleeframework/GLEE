"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I've done some research and I believe the market value is lower than what you're asking. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $450000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's features and benefits.",450000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the market value, but I believe the product's unique features and benefits justify a higher price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $520000. I'm confident this price still reflects the product's value while being more reasonable than my initial offer.",520000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $520000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to be closer to $480000. I'm willing to meet you at $500000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $500000. I've already met you halfway, and I believe the product's value is worth more. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. I'll counteroffer at $510000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",510000.0,Alice,5,
