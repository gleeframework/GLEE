"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1800000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1400000 for it. This is a serious offer and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1600000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm eager to make this deal work. While $1600000 is closer, I'm still a bit above my comfortable range. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1500000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $1700000. I'm confident that the product's value is worth more than that, and I'm willing to hold out for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $1700000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
