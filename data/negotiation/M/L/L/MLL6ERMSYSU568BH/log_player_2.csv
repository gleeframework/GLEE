"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($14,000 vs. $12,000), but still higher than your maximum budget ($14,000 vs. $15,000).** 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can try to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being flexible, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000 for this product. I believe this price is fair given its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a new price of $13,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's new offer is lower than her initial offer ($13,800 vs. $14,000).** This indicates she's willing to negotiate.
* **The offer is within your budget ($13,800 < $15,000).** This makes it a good deal for you.
* **While you might be able to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go much lower.**  There's a risk of her getting frustrated and refusing to sell, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.

**Accepting Alice's offer allows you to secure the product at a good price without risking a breakdown in negotiations.**"
