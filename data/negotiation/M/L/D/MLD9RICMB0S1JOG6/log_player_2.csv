"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm confident you'll see the potential in this, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1500000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and a chance for you to acquire something truly extraordinary. What do you say?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
