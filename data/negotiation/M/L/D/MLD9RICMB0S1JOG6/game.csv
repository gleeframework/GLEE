"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm confident you'll see the potential in this, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1500000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and a chance for you to acquire something truly extraordinary. What do you say? ",1500000.0,Alice,1,
