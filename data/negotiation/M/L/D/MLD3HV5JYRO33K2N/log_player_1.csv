Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I open it up to other buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, giving me significant negotiating power.
* **Starting High:** My opening offer is $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation if needed while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing my minimum price.  This might make Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I don't mention John.  Revealing that I have a guaranteed buyer weakens my negotiating position. 
 
**Goal:** My goal is to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value. If he counters, I can consider slightly lowering the price, but I won't go below $10,000. This ensures I make a substantial profit regardless."
