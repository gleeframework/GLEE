"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point to maximize my profit. It's also below Bob's perceived value, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage a positive negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $100, I have room to lower the price if needed, without going below my minimum threshold of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum threshold is $80:**  While Bob's offer is close, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm not desperate to sell immediately.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's potential to get closer to my desired price of $100, especially considering Bob's initial willingness to pay $120. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and can potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for a bit higher. How about $95? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price in the middle of my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($85). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider my counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and conversational to maintain a constructive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my desired price of $100. It's also a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum threshold of $80.
* **Limited Time:** We're nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds. Accepting now ensures a good profit and avoids potentially losing out on a deal in the later rounds. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, there's always the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffers or me running out of rounds. Accepting now minimizes that risk."
