"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique and valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find extremely useful. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $1000000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this unique product, $950000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to offer you $750000 for it, reflecting my maximum acceptable price. I'm confident this is still a fair deal for you considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is your maximum acceptable price, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value to me. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a counteroffer of $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $850000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $800000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to accept $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $825000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
