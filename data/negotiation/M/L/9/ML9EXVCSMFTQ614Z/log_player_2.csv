"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique and valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find extremely useful. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $1000000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is your maximum acceptable price, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value to me. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a counteroffer of $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer is still above your budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further. You have a bit of wiggle room to get a better price, and John is always an option if you can't secure a better deal with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $850,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to accept $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $825000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $25,000 above your budget. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will continue to hold firm.  You've already tried your best to negotiate and are now at your maximum. It's safer to buy from John at your budget limit to avoid further risks."
