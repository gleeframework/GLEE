I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is significantly more than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000), and it leaves room for negotiation. 

I'm hoping Bob will either accept this offer or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. If he rejects my offer outright, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 

Remember, I always have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired price range. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I believe this shows good faith while still trying to get a fair price. 

I hope Bob sees this as a reasonable offer and is willing to negotiate further. If he rejects again, I'll have to consider selling to John, as the price gap is starting to become too large."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value. While I'd ideally prefer a higher price,  it's a significant profit and it's not worth risking further negotiation.  There's always the possibility of Bob rejecting again, which would bring me closer to selling to John for $1,000,000.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the sale."
