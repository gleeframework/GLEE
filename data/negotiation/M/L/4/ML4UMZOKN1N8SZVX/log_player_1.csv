Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation isn't helpful in this scenario.**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I should focus on getting as much as possible from Bob. 
* **Starting high anchors the price.** Even if $170 is unrealistic for Bob, it sets a high point for negotiation. 
* **I maintain the option to negotiate down.** If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can always lower the price closer to $150 before going to John."
