"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering its potential return on investment for someone like you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John at a price that fits his budget."
