"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $120 to you. Let's discuss how we can reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.** You are willing to pay $120, so there's no immediate gain from accepting.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  You have 10 rounds to try and get a better price. By rejecting, you open the door to counter-offers and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm really interested in your product, though. Would you be willing to come down to $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a moderate counteroffer:**  $110 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still within a reasonable range where she might be willing to negotiate.
* **Express interest:** By highlighting your interest in the product, you show Alice that you're serious and are willing to negotiate. 
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  A counteroffer of $110 gives you some wiggle room if Alice rejects it. You can then counter with a higher price (e.g., $115) in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. To accommodate your budget, I am willing to consider $115 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget:**  $115 is still below your maximum price point of $120.
* **Negotiation has progressed:** Alice has lowered her price from $120 to $115, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further, and you might end up paying the full $120 to John.

**Accepting the offer is the most practical choice, as it secures the product at a price you're comfortable with without risking a prolonged negotiation.**"
