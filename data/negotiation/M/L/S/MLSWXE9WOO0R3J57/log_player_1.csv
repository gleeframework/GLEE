Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $125 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** Highlighting that the product is worth $150 to him makes the offer more attractive.
* **Open ended:**  The message leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 
* **Safety net:**  I'm aware that John is willing to buy for $100, so I'm confident in my starting price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still have room to get a better price. 
* **Value for Bob:** Bob still considers the product worth $150. This means there's a good chance I can get a higher price by counter-offering. 
* **Avoiding a loss:** Even if the negotiations fail, I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay $100. This gives me leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $110 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $115?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm still reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to incentivize him to pay a little more.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm not yet at my minimum price, so I still have leverage to negotiate further."
