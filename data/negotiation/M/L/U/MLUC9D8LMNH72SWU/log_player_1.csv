Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $2,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,750,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob seems firmly anchored at $1,200,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is more profitable than continuing with Bob's lowball offers."
