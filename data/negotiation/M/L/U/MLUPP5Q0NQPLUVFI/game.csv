"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $9,000? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $8,750 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a good agreement. ",8750.0,Bob,4,
