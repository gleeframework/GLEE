Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell now, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum asking price of $10,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 4
