"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $105. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think!",105.0,Alice,5,
