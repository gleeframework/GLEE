"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its market value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It is not a good idea to sell the product to John for $8,000, as I can potentially get a better deal from Bob. Also, $9,000 is not a good enough price considering Bob's value for the product. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $10,500?  This still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's work together to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,000?  That's a fair price considering the value you place on the product and leaves some room for me to make a profit.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,750? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and our negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally like a higher price, accepting Bob's offer for $9,750 is the best option here.  It's just above my minimum value and given the limited rounds left, it's likely I won't be able to get a better price. It's also a good compromise considering our negotiation history."
