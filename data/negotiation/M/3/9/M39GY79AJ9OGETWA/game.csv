"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that's worth $1000000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $750000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value the product holds for you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $800000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $815000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",815000.0,Alice,5,
