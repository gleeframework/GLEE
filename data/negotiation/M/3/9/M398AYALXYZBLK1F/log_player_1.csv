While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** This price is still a $50,000 gain over selling to John.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out negotiations has a cost. Accepting now secures the profit.
* **Uncertain Future:**  There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and we risk him walking away."
