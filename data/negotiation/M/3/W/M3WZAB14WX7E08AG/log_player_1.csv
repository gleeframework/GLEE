Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm asking for $1,300,000, which reflects its true worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit.  
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, and we know John will pay $1,500,000. Aiming for a price between these values maximizes the chance of Bob accepting while still securing a significant profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and we can always slightly reduce the price if needed. 
* **Confident Message:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly justifying the price while leaving room for discussion."
