"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm really interested in this product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we start at $1,000,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can do $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000. I'm still a little hesitant though. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away happy with the deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,050,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1,080,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
