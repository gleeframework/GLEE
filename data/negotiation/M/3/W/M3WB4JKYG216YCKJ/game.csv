"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm proposing $1600000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value and market conditions. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. I believe that's a fair price for the product's value.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's try to bridge the gap. I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise further. I'm proposing $1400000. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's get this deal done.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's my final offer. I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $1250000 is just too low for me to accept. I'm willing to go down to $1350000 as a final concession. This is the best I can do. Let's close this deal now.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000, but that's my final offer. If I don't get that, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
