"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $600,000 is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. I'll see if I can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $500,000. This reflects my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 500000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $550,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $550,000 is a good deal for me. While I'd prefer to pay even less, it's a significant savings compared to buying from John for $800,000.  It's also a good compromise from her previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.  At this point, accepting her offer is the most beneficial option."
