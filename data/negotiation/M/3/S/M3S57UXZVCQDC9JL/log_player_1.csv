Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $500,000. This reflects my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
