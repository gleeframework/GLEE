{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob has a better option with John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above his maximum budget. This signals that he's serious about buying but is also pushing for a fair price. He's leaving room for negotiation while also ensuring he doesn't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to try and lower the price. Buying from John is still a viable option if negotiations fail, so there's no need to accept a price that's still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again increasing his offer, but by a smaller margin this time. He's showing Alice that he's willing to negotiate, but he's also sticking to his budget.  This strategy keeps the negotiation moving and allows him to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While she has lowered the price, it's not enough for Bob to accept. He has a guaranteed deal with John at a price that fits his budget. At this point, continuing negotiations with Alice is a risk, and there's no guarantee that she will come down to a price that works for Bob. It's more prudent for him to take the guaranteed deal with John."
