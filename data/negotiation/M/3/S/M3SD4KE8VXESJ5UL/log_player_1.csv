Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer gives Bob a good deal, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to him.  However, it also leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired price, but I can still try to get more.  I will reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I will stick with my previous offer of $1,400,000. This price is still a good deal for Bob, and it's closer to my target than his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,380,000 is a good compromise. It is significantly higher than John's offer, and the potential for further negotiation is dwindling.  It's time to secure the deal and avoid further risk."
