"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $10,500 is still a bit lower than I can accept at this time. How about $11,500? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of the product to you. Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
