"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting the initial offer of $90 is the best move. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's a great offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you consider $80? I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $87? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still trying to save as much money as possible. Even though $87 is a better offer than the initial $90, it's still higher than your ideal price point.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we settle on $88? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $88 is within your budget, and while it's not your ideal price, it's a good compromise.  You've already gone back and forth a few times, and there's a risk that Alice will get tired of negotiating and you'll end up having to buy from John for $100."
