"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth a premium price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. How about we consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $6,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $9,000 for it. Can we discuss a price of $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Could we perhaps agree on $7,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, I believe.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $7,000, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $8,500 for it. Can we meet at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we are getting close.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further, how about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,500, which would be $8,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",8000.0,Alice,7,
