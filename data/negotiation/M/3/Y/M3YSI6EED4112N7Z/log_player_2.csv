Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To further explore a mutually beneficial agreement, I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair transaction while respecting the value you place on it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still better than buying from John for $12,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject any lower counteroffers, leading him to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal for Bob, saving him $1,000 compared to John."
