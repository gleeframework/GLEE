"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm willing to part with for a price of $12000. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll agree once you see it in person.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I can offer it to you for $10200. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $10050. It's my final compromise, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",10050.0,Alice,9,

"I'm not willing to go any higher than $9800. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere. I've already found another seller who is willing to sell the product to me for $8000.",9800.0,Bob,10,
