"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential benefits.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for the price (value and potential benefits) to make it seem more justified.
* **Openness:** I invite Bob to share his thoughts to encourage a dialogue and make him feel like he's part of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering its value and potential benefits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum of $1,000,000, I'm not willing to sell for less than that yet.
* **There's room for negotiation.** I have 8 more rounds to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  I can always go to John if the negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high for me. How about $1,050,000?  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer to Bob, but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in entirely.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm reiterating the need for a fair price for the product.  This helps to justify my position and encourages Bob to see the value in meeting my price.
* **Collaborative Approach:** I'm emphasizing the need for a solution that works for both of us. This promotes a more positive and cooperative tone in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still holding out for a higher price, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000. I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still too low:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to settle for less than that at this point.
* **Time is on my side:**  I still have 6 rounds left, and John is a guaranteed buyer.  I can afford to be patient and see if Bob is willing to come up. 
* **Testing the waters:**  By rejecting this offer, I can see how seriously Bob wants to buy the product. If he's truly interested, he may be willing to increase his offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's true value and would allow me to proceed with the sale.  I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm Stand:**  I'm standing firm on my minimum price of $1,000,000.  This is a strong stance that shows Bob I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""true value"" of the product. This reiterates my rationale for my price and may make Bob reconsider his offer.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the price as a ""mutually beneficial solution."" This helps Bob see that agreeing to my price is in his best interest as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but no higher. I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value and our previous discussions. Can you consider this offer?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum, but not quite there:**  While Bob's offer is only $25,000 below my minimum, I'm not willing to risk losing more time with the negotiations.
* **Time is running out:**  We are already at Round 6, and I have only 4 rounds remaining. I don't want to risk further delays and potentially miss out on John's offer.
* **Secure the deal:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired minimum price and a quicker resolution. I can move on to other opportunities."
