"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go below $105. That's my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go lower than $105, and your goal is to get the product for $100 or less.  It's time to cut your losses and take John's offer."
