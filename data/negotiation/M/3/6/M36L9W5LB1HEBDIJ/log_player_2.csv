"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I think you'll find this price to be very competitive, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,500,000.  There's a chance you can get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down further."
