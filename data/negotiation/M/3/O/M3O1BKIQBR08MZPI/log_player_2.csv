"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice:**  Costs $950,000, which is less than your maximum price of $1,200,000.
* **Buying from John:** Costs $1,200,000, which is your maximum price but leaves no room for negotiation.

Since you want to save as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy. You'll still get the product and save $250,000 compared to buying from John."
