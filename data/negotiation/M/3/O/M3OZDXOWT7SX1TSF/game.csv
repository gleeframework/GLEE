"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I understand your perspective,  $600,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table.  I could consider a price of $900,000.  This reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a good deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,
