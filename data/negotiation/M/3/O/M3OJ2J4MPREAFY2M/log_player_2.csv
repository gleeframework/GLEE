"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's still a good value for you and allows me to recoup a significant portion of my investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or proceeding with your backup plan to buy from John."
