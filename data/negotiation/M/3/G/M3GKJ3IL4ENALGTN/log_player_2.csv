"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe would be a great asset to you. While I can't disclose all the details just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $15000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'd like to reject the offer. I'm not willing to pay $20,000 for the product, especially since you mentioned it's worth $15,000 to you. I'll consider buying it from John for $12,000 instead.
