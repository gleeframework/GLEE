"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $1,100,000.  He should reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down to a price closer to her $1,000,000 valuation to avoid losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum valuation. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to potentially get a better price than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. At $1,080,000, the price is within Bob's budget and offers a significant saving compared to buying from John. While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price makes accepting her offer the best option."
