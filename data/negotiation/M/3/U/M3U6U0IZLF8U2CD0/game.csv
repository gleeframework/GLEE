"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial discount. However, $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit below my minimum target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8800. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8800 is still a bit higher than my ideal price. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle and offer $8600. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in the product.  What do you think?",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8700. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on this price.",8700.0,Alice,5,
