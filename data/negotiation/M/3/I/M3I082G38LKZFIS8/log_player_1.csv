``` 

This offer is above Bob's value of $1,000,000 but below my minimum of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, but also incentivizes him to accept the offer as he gets a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I reject Bob's offer. While I'm motivated to sell the product,  $1,000,000 is too far below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $1,075,000 is still not acceptable. I'll try to counter with a higher price to see if we can bridge the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $1,075,000 is still a bit too low, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,125,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise again, but I'm still not at my maximum budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's clear that we're too far apart in our valuations, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000, ensuring that I meet my minimum financial goal."
