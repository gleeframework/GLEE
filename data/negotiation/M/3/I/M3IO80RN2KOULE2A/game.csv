"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,500.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already mentioned that I'm not willing to go below $13,500. I can meet you halfway at $13,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,750. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $13,250, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, I think we can finalize the deal.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $12,750. If you're willing to come down just a bit, I think we can finalize the deal.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can meet you at $13,000, but that's the absolute lowest I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, I think we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your persistence, but $13,000 is still slightly higher than I'm willing to pay.  Could you consider $12,900 as a final compromise?  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",12900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession. I'm willing to meet you at $13,050, but that's the final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying the product at a fair price.",13050.0,Alice,9,
