{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,500,000, it's still above Bob's maximum of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price within his budget. This counteroffer starts at a significant discount from Alice's initial price, making a clear statement of his desired price point. It leaves room for negotiation while staying within Bob's budget."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price of $1,200,000. While it's closer than her initial offer, it's still not within Bob's budget. He has a good chance of getting closer to his desired price by continuing negotiations. There are still 7 rounds left, and Bob has time to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is demonstrating his commitment to finding a mutually acceptable price point. This offer is a small increase from his last counteroffer, showing that he is willing to compromise, but it still remains within his budget. This allows for potential finalization of the deal within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,330,000 is still above Bob's desired price, but it's getting very close to his budget. With only three rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice increases. It's also possible that Alice might become less flexible in the coming rounds. Buying the product from John would guarantee a price within Bob's budget, but accepting Alice's offer might still save him some money. Considering the potential for further negotiation and the risk of not reaching a deal, it's strategically advantageous for Bob to accept Alice's offer."
