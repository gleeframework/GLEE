"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $20000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12000.  This is a fair price considering I'm a serious buyer and we can close the deal quickly.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $15000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13000.  If you're serious about selling, this is the best I can do.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm running out of rounds and John is offering my minimum price. I'm going to sell the product to John to ensure I get my desired price."
