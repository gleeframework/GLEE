"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $18,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget ($18,000 vs $10,000). It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $18,000 is far more than I'm willing to pay. I'm offering $10,000. This is my top limit. Let me know if you're willing to work with that."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $18,000 is closer to the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go a little higher than my initial offer, but $14,000 is a stretch. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
