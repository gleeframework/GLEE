"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product is valuable, but  $1,600,000 is not within my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this negotiation.  While $1,600,000 represents its true value, I understand your perspective on the price. Considering that, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. However, $1,200,000 is still a long way from what I had in mind. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know if this works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us.  I'm willing to make another significant move and drop my price to $1,000,000. This is the very lowest I can go, as it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
