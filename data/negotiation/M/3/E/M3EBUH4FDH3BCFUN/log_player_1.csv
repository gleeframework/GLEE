Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product is valuable, but  $1,600,000 is not within my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
