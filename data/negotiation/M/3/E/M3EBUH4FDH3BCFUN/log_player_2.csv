"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product is valuable, but  $1,600,000 is not within my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this negotiation.  While $1,600,000 represents its true value, I understand your perspective on the price. Considering that, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. However, $1,200,000 is still a long way from what I had in mind. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know if this works for you."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us.  I'm willing to make another significant move and drop my price to $1,000,000. This is the very lowest I can go, as it's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, but she's still trying to anchor you around the idea of its ""true value"" being $1,000,000.  You have a firm alternative: buy from John for $800,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice when you can get the product for a guaranteed lower price elsewhere."
