"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us, so I'm offering $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,000,000. I'm willing to make another slight concession and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really want to make this deal work, but I'm simply unable to go above $975,000. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one last concession and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
