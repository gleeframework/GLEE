"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me at this point. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I am too.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still slightly higher than I can comfortably go at this point.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,100,000.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away with a positive outcome.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to sell to him for $1,100,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. There are still several rounds left, and I think I can push for a better deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,125,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a deal we are happy with. Let's finalize this agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Although it's getting closer to my goal, I believe I can still squeeze a bit more out of him. With only four rounds left, the pressure is on, but I think a counteroffer will be worth it."
