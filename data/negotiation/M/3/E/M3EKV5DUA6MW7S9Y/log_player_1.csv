**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob is consistently moving towards a reasonable middle ground. Accepting $1,180,000 is a significant profit, and continuing to push risks him walking away entirely.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with John's lower offer later."
