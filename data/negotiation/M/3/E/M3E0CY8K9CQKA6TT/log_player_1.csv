Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is still a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I have 9 rounds left, so I'm going to see if I can get closer to my target price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject his offer. I'm not in a rush, and I'd prefer to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While I'd like to get more, Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, and I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher.  I'd rather not risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000."
