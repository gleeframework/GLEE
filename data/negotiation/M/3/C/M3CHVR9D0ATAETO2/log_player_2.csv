This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Price is right:**  $755,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $800,000.
* **Alice is firm:** Alice has indicated this is her final compromise. Pushing further might make her less willing to negotiate and you could lose the deal. 
* **Time is ticking:** You're getting closer to the 10-round limit. If you push too hard and don't reach an agreement, you might be forced to buy from John at the higher price."
