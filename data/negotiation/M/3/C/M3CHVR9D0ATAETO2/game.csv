"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $775,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value while being more in line with your budget.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price point I'm comfortable with. How about $740,000?",740000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal for the product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a bit more than $740,000. I'm counteroffering at $760,000. This price still reflects the product's value while being more in line with your latest offer.",760000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate you working with me. To be honest, I have another offer on the table, but I'd much rather work with you.  Would you be willing to close the deal at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm glad to hear that you prefer working with me. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $755,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",755000.0,Alice,7,
