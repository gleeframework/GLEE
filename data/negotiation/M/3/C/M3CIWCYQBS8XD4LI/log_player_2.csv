"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to your ideal price range, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice.  You're willing to pay up to $800,000, so you have some leverage to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within your acceptable range.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer again. Additionally, there's no guarantee that John will still be available to sell at $800,000 if you reject Alice's offer.  It's more prudent to accept the current offer and secure the product."
