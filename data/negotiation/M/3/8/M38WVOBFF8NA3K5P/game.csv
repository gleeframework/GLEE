"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value I see in this asset. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is significantly lower than the value I believe this product holds.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is a fair compromise considering the potential value this asset could bring you. Let's see if we can reach a deal that benefits us both.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
