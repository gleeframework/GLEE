"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable asset for $1500000. I believe this price reflects the inherent value of the product, but I'm open to discussing it further if you're interested. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. There's no incentive to accept right away. Rejecting allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price. You have nothing to lose by trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value I see in this asset. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is significantly lower than the value I believe this product holds.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is a fair compromise considering the potential value this asset could bring you. Let's see if we can reach a deal that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,350,000, which is within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While I might be able to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and forcing me to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price within my budget."
