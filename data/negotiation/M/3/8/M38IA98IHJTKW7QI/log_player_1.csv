Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is significantly more than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal.  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he has incentive to negotiate and come to an agreement. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price through negotiation, but I don't want to push him away with an unreasonable initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $950,000 is a good offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm countering with $975,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation. I'm confident that I can reach a final price that's closer to my desired $1,000,000 mark."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $920,000 is a good offer, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000} 
```

I'm countering with $940,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to reach an agreement while still maintaining a price that is closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell to John for $800,000.  While I would have liked to have gotten a higher price from Bob, the negotiations have stalled, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. John's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, so it's a good deal for me."
