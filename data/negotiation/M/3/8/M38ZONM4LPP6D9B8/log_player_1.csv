Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is strategically priced:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $11,500 is above your minimum of $10,000, ensuring a profit.
* **Lower than Bob's value:** $11,500 is below the $12,000 value Bob places on the product, giving him an incentive to buy. 

This approach maximizes your chances of earning the most, as it balances your need for a profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
