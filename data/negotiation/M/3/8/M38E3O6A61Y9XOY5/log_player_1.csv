Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm not comfortable selling for that price yet, especially since I know the product is worth so much more to him.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While I'd love to get closer to my target price, we're running out of time. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale. $910,000 is still a good profit for me, and it's better than risking losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
