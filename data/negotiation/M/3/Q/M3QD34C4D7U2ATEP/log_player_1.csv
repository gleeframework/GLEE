"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll try to push for something closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This is a fair price that takes into account both of our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with the deal.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob seems stubborn and is unwilling to budge.  John is a sure thing and will pay my minimum, so it's better to take the guaranteed money rather than risk getting stuck with a lower offer."
