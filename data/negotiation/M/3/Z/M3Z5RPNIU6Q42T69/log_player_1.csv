"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value. You have plenty of room to negotiate and rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can offer it for $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Hold Firm:** We've reduced our price slightly, but still signal that we're not willing to go drastically below our initial offer.  
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value, we aim to shift Bob's focus from a large discount to a more reasonable price point.
* **Room to Negotiate:** We've left space for further negotiation if Bob comes back with a counter-offer closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is still a little too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Your Minimum:** Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Strong Position:** While you could push for more, there's a risk Bob might walk away in later rounds. Accepting now secures a good profit. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal sooner rather than later eliminates uncertainty and allows you to move on to other opportunities."
