"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can offer it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is still a little too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
