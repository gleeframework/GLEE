"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is only $1,000,000 to you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This price is still a fantastic value for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my desired price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is only $1,000,000 to you.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're both serious about finding a price that works for us. While I appreciate your persistence, $950,000 is still not quite there for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects its value, and it ensures we both walk away happy with the deal.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
