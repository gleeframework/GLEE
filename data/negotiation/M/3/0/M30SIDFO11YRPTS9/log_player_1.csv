Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is only $1,000,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent price, it's still below what the product is worth to me. I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is only $1,000,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While we're getting closer, $950,000 is still significantly below my desired price. I believe I can push for a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both serious about finding a price that works for us. While I appreciate your persistence, $950,000 is still not quite there for me. Let's meet in the middle.
