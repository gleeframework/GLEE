Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counter-offer. I want to see if I can push him closer to my minimum of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation.  It's better to secure the deal now than to potentially lose him and have to sell to John."
