"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's in excellent condition and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While the product is worth $150 to you, $120 is still a significant markup from Alice's valuation.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room to negotiate and get a better price. You can likely get the product for less than $120. 
* **Risk of going to John:**  While John is a safe option, you might be able to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $100?  I'm really interested in the product and think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a great price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room to negotiate:** Alice has come down, but there's still a gap between her offer ($110) and your target price (around $100).  
* **Counteroffer is the next step:**  A counteroffer will allow you to see if Alice is willing to come down further. 
* **John is a backup:**  While John is a reliable option, you're still closer to getting the product from Alice at a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. I'm really keen on getting this product, but I'm still not quite there at $110.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I think this would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
