"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $100?  I'm really interested in the product and think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a great price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible. I'm really keen on getting this product, but I'm still not quite there at $110.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I think this would be a good deal for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
