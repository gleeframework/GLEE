"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to make the price more palatable.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This initial offer sets the stage for potential counteroffers, allowing me to gauge Bob's interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is my best offer, considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. His counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay more than his initial assessment of $8,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I'm hoping to push for a higher price in the next round.  

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,500? This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Appeal to Fairness:** By using phrases like ""meet you halfway"" and ""good deal"", I'm framing the counteroffer as a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Continuing the Negotiation:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward, leaving room for potential adjustments in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500. However, I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm willing to go to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I'm hoping to find a compromise that benefits both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $10,500.  I'll emphasize the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm But Flexible:**  I'm sticking to my commitment to get at least $10,000 for the product but am still willing to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as fair and mutually beneficial, highlighting the value of the product for Bob.
* **Closing the Gap:**  This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from my previous offer and is hopefully closer to Bob's budget.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to evaluate if continuing the negotiation is worthwhile.  If the price isn't moving closer to my desired range, I might consider selling to John for $15,000."
