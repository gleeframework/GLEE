"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is my best offer, considering my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,500? This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500. However, I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm willing to go to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a profit. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
