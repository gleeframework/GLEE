"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for you. You can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is my best offer, considering my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,500? This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate further. You have several rounds remaining, and there's potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500. However, I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm willing to go to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $10,000 is a good deal. It's within your budget and you only have 5 rounds left to close the deal. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go lower and you risk losing the deal and having to buy from John."
