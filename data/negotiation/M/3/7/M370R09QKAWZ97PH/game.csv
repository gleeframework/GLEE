"Hey Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $120. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you the product for $160. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $160 is still a little out of my range. I'm happy to pay $130 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get for the product, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $145. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $145 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to pay $135 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",135.0,Bob,6,
