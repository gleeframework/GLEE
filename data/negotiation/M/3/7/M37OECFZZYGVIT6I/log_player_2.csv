Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your target price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower, and $10,500 is a good price, saving $4,500 compared to John's offer."
