Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product significantly exceeds your offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is firmly stuck at a price far too low.  It's clear further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap. Accepting his offer represents a significant loss. It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
