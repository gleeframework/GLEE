"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? This would be a good deal for me while still giving you a significant profit.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,250,000? This would give you a good price for the product and allow me to recoup a reasonable portion of my investment.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That's a significant move from my previous offer, demonstrating my commitment to getting this done.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is closer to your previous offer and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know if that works for you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
