"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm confident you'll recognize its potential. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000. This is a significant discount from what I believe its true value to be.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
