"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $10000 for it. Would you consider adjusting your price to meet my budget?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10000 is your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $12500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I still believe that $10000 is the maximum I can afford. Could we possibly meet at $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $11000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering it to you for $13000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
