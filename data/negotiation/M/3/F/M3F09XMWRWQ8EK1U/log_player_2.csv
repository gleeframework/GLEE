"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it will be immensely valuable to you, even more so than it is to me.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
Explanation: Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also less than John's offer.  Therefore, it makes the most sense to accept her offer and save $100,000."
