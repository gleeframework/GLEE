"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1050000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $1075000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close to the final stretch, and I'm willing to make one last concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1025000. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than my previous offer of $975000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.,975000.0,Bob,8,
