Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is beneficial to both parties. It is above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but leaves room for Bob to counteroffer if he feels it's too high.  It also frames the negotiation as a win-win situation for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with my own to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low just yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $9750?  It's still a good deal for you, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $9200 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,200 is close enough to my target and still significantly higher than selling to John. It's time to accept and close the deal."
