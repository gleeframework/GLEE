Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he has a potential profit margin of $200,000 if he buys from you at the right price. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know John exists or your guaranteed fallback offer.

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of Bob's potential profit margin as possible without pushing him away.  Offering a price slightly below his valuation creates a win-win scenario.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it aligns perfectly with your needs. I'm offering it to you at $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" subtly reinforce the product's worth.
* **Price Point:**  $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 potential profit, making it highly likely he'll accept. You secure a $150,000 gain over your minimum.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a range in mind for how low you're willing to go.
* **Relationship Matters:** While maximizing profit is key, consider the long-term implications if you push Bob too hard and sour the potential for future deals."
