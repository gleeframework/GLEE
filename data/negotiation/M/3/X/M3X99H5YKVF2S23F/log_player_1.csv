Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $230. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 230} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression that the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (even if vague) can make it seem more palatable. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer is primarily to get a sense of how interested Bob is and how he responds to higher prices.  

I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's reaction to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $230 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $100.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would mean a considerable loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While his offer is low, his message indicates strong interest. This suggests there's room for negotiation, and I might be able to get him closer to a price that works for me.
* **John as Backup:** I still have the option to sell to John for my minimum, so there's limited risk in continuing the negotiation with Bob for a little longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob.  While I can't go as low as $100, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway. How about we consider $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price significantly, but not drastically. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  Framing the offer as ""meeting halfway"" creates a sense of fairness, even though the midpoint between his initial offer and my initial asking price would be much lower.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This offer keeps me comfortably above my absolute minimum price, allowing for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $180 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has explicitly stated that $120 is his absolute limit. This suggests there's little chance of him going any higher.
* **Below Minimum:** Even with further negotiation, it's unlikely Bob will reach my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. There's no further risk or need for negotiation.

While I might have squeezed a bit more out of Bob, the difference isn't worth the risk of losing a guaranteed sale to John."
