"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $12,000 is significantly more than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000) and leaves you with less room to negotiate. 
* **It's early in the negotiation:** You have 10 rounds, so rejecting the initial offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  Let's split the difference.  How about $10,750?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, $10,750 is still above the midpoint between her value and my maximum. 
* **More negotiation is possible:** We're only in round 3, and there's room for further negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,750 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer:** $10,500 is closer to my target price than any previous offer.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks that Alice will walk away or that I'll run out of rounds.
* **Good value for the product:**  While I could potentially try to get a lower price, the $10,500 offer is a reasonable compromise."
