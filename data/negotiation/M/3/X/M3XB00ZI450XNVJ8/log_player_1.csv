"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's well above your minimum price of $8,000, but also leaves room for negotiation to potentially reach a higher price that's still attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the value of the product to Bob. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for potentially reaching a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  Let's split the difference.  How about $10,750?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,750 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, it's still below the potential value you could get from Bob.  You have time, and you want to try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
