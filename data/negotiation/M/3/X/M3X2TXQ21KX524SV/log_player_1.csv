Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, considering it's worth more to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential benefit for Bob. 

This strategy allows for a potential negotiation while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $120.  I'm not willing to sell at that price yet, as I can potentially get closer to my desired value through further negotiation or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product for Bob and emphasizing the potential for a win-win situation.

This strategy aims to nudge Bob closer to my desired price while keeping the negotiation open and friendly."
