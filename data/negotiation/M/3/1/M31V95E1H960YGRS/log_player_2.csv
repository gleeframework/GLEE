"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$600,000 is a good starting point, but there's significant room for negotiation.  It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer,  lowering the price by 33%. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to see Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she rejects this, I can gradually increase my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $500,000 is a good price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my initial target. I still have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $450,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I still believe I can get a better price than her last offer. This strategy allows me to gauge her willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $550,000, which is a good price considering my initial counteroffer and my goal of staying under $1,500,000.  While I could keep trying to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my offer and then raising her price again is too high. It's better to accept this deal and secure the product."
