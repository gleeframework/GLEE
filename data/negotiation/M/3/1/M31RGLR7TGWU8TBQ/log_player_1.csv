Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable, and I know you'd benefit greatly from it. I'm willing to offer it to you at a significantly discounted price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, selling to Bob at a higher price yields more profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $950,000 is a substantial offer for Bob, leaving him with a $150,000 potential gain (his valuation of $800,000 vs. the offer price). It's a strong incentive for him to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while maintaining a high probability of closing the deal before resorting to the guaranteed offer from John."
