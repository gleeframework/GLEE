Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but that's as low as I can go.  This product is truly worth more, and I believe it will generate significant value for you.  Let's find common ground.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still too wide for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's my limit. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits for you. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $750,000, but that's absolutely my final offer.  It's a fair compromise considering John is offering me a similar product at a lower price."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000, as a final compromise. This reflects the true value of the product and represents a significant concession on my part. If you're truly interested, I believe this is the last opportunity to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000, and even if she did, the savings would be minimal compared to the risk of her ending the negotiation. John provides a guaranteed price point that meets your needs."
