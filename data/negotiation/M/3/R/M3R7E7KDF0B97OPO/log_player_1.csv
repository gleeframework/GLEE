"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to negotiation, which could lead to a more amicable and productive conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  He clearly values the product at $15,000, so I'm confident I can get a price closer to that.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Rejecting his offer demonstrates my willingness to stand firm on my price and encourages further negotiation. 
* **Limited Time:** I want to avoid selling to John for $8,000 if possible, but I'm conscious of the limited rounds and will reassess if I don't see significant progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows good faith and helps to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to remind Bob of its worth and strengthen my position. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the benefits of the deal for both of us, highlighting the opportunity to ""benefit from this transaction."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $10,250 is significantly closer to my target price than John's offer of $8,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing a good deal by being too stubborn. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though this deal is a bit below my initial asking price, a positive relationship with Bob could lead to future deals where I can potentially achieve even better prices."
