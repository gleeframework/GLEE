Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm and the value you see in it. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1400000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $1400000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1450000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After carefully considering your latest offer, I believe we can reach an agreement that respects both our positions. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1425000. I hope this figure is within your acceptable range and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1425000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go up to $1425000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $1430000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1430000.0,Alice,5,

"I've given this matter considerable thought, Alice, and I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. While I respect your position, I am unable to meet the price of $1430000. I would like to make one last counteroffer of $1420000. I hope this proposal is acceptable, and we can proceed with the transaction.",1420000.0,Bob,6,
