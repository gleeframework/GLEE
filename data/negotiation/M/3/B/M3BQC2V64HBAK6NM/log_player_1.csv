Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $900,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential benefits for your business."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits the product will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can do better and will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $750,000 is a lower price than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $850,000?  That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits the product will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and I'm confident that I can't get a better offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his offer is the best option at this point."
