"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle on $800,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you consider $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This price still gives you a significant advantage over the market value and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
