Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle on $800,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This price still gives you a significant advantage over the market value and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly motivated to sell and is moving closer to our desired price point. While we could try to push for an even lower price, there's a risk that she'll become less willing to negotiate or that we might run out of rounds. $975,000 is a significant savings compared to her initial offer and John's price, making it a good deal at this point."
