{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain. Please let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, Bob's valuation of $1,200,000 presents a chance to earn significantly more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves a $100,000 profit margin for Bob, incentivizing him to purchase while still securing a substantial profit for us.
* **First Refusal:** By approaching Bob first, we acknowledge his higher valuation and create a sense of priority, potentially leading to a quicker and more profitable sale.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and your negotiation style, you might adjust the price slightly up or down. However, aiming for a price between $800,000 and $1,200,000 is crucial to maximize your potential profit."
