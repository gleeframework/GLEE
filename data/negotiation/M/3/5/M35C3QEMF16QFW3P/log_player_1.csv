{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I could get elsewhere.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value ($1,500,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed. It's also a good starting point for Bob, as it's lower than his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Message:** I'm using a positive and persuasive tone, highlighting the benefits for both of us. I'm also subtly mentioning the alternative of selling to John, without directly threatening it. 
* **Strategy:** This approach aims to:
    *  Quickly establish a reasonable price range.
    *  Encourage Bob to accept the offer before he considers making a lower counteroffer. 
    *  Maintain leverage by keeping the option of selling to John open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to hold firm on my position.  

By rejecting his offer, I can:

*  **Maintain Leverage:** Show Bob that I'm not desperate and that I'm prepared to walk away if necessary.
*  **Signal my Value:**  Reinforce that the product is worth more than $900,000.
*  **Explore Higher Offers:**  I can try to find a middle ground that's closer to my minimum value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my minimum value.

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $1,100,000, which is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still holding onto a significant profit.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive but firm tone, emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit. I'm also subtly reminding Bob that I'm not desperate to sell and have other options. 
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Signal My Value:** Reinforce that the product is worth more than $1,050,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  While I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, I need to be closer to my minimum value.  I'm offering $1,150,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and would still allow you to make a significant profit.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement that we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $1,150,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a better price. 
* **Message:** I'm using a positive but firm tone, reminding Bob of the product's value and my desire for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to:
    *  Signal my seriousness about a deal but not be overly aggressive.
    *  Keep the pressure on Bob to accept a price closer to my target.
    *  Maintain the option of selling to John if negotiations stall.

The key here is to be flexible yet resolute in my pursuit of a price that is closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering $1,075,000. I think this is the highest I can go and still make a profit. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, $1,075,000 is still significantly less than the $1,500,000 I could get from John.  At this point, the potential for further negotiation is low, and I'm not confident I can achieve a price that's closer to my target. 

Choosing to sell to John allows me to:

* **Maximize Profit:** Secure the highest possible price for my product.
* **Minimize Risk:** Avoid further negotiation and potential for a lower price.
* **Avoid Delays:**  Quickly finalize the sale and avoid further negotiation with Bob. 

It's a strategic decision to prioritize a guaranteed profit over potentially squeezing out a slightly higher price from Bob."
