"Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
