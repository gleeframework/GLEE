"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While I appreciate your perspective, the product's value significantly exceeds that price point, particularly in the current market.  Would you consider $1,900,000? This offer reflects a more accurate valuation of the product's potential.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has significant value, but I still think $1,900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1,050,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
