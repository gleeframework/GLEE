"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, close to my minimum, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I know he values the product at $8,000, so this leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is still significantly less than my minimum of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's so low. I have 8 rounds left, so there's still time to find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $10,000.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for profit. Hopefully Bob will see this as a fair compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is getting closer to Bob's valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I have other options.  I'll continue to negotiate, but I'm not giving up on getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm offering $9,500, which is halfway between my last offer and Bob's. I'm showing flexibility but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to meet him halfway and get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are too low, and I'm starting to run out of time. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not confident we can reach an agreement with only 4 rounds left. Selling to John at $12,000 guarantees me my desired price and avoids the risk of ending up with a suboptimal deal."
