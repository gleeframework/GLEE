"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",15000.0,Alice,3,
