"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our discussion.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $950000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $1025000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1100000. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to make a slight concession and propose a counteroffer of $1075000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's the best we can achieve at this point.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
