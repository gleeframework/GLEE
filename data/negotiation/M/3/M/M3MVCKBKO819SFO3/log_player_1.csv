Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it.  I'm asking for $1,500,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a more than fair price."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,500,000 allows for a 50% profit margin if Bob accepts. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential gain, aiming to justify the high price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, with a guaranteed buyer, you're not losing money by aiming high."
