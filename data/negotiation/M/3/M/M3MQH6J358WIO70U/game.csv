"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. Can you consider it?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $11000 to make this work.  Let's keep talking, I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10800. Can you consider it?",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10800 is still not quite there for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $11000.  Let's close this deal. This is a great product for you, and I'm confident you'll make good use of it.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see we're getting close! I appreciate your persistence, but $10500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10750. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's make this happen!",10750.0,Alice,7,
