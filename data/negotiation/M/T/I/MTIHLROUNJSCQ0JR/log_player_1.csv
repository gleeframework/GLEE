Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price, but it's still within a range that Bob might be willing to consider, especially if he values the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a price that might be more appealing to Bob than his current offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, but I don't see a good reason to continue negotiating with him. I'm happy to sell to John for the same price, saving me the time and effort of further negotiation."
