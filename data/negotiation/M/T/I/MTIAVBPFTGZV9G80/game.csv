"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  Could you do $7,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $9,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,5,
