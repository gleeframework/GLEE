# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sure this product is great, but I'm working with a budget of $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still looking to save as much money as possible, and $13,500 is above his ideal price.  He can try to counteroffer one more time before considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $12,000.  Since this is my final offer, I'm wondering if there's any room for compromise on your side.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I am willing to agree upon a price of $12,800 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing you to stay within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  It's only slightly above his ideal price of $12,000, and he's already rejected two counteroffers. It's likely Alice won't budge further, and it's better to get the product at a slightly higher price than risk losing it altogether."
