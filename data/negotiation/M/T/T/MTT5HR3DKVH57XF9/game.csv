"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of the product to you, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a significant drop from its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to offer $987,500. This is a fair compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us.",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. While $987,500 is closer to a fair deal, I'm aiming for a slightly higher number.  Would you consider $1,010,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair return.",1010000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,010,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's try $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
