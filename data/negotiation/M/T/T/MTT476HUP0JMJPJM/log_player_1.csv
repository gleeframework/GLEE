Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers excellent value, even at this price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, she should aim for a price slightly below that to incentivize Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $11,999 creates a sense of urgency and a perceived bargain for Bob. It's a price that's very close to Alice's minimum but significantly more attractive for Bob than his perceived value of $10,000.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  Alice knows John is a reliable backup buyer, so she can be more confident in offering a higher price to Bob."
