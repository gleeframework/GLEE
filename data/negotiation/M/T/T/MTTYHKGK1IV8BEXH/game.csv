"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe it's a bit above the market value, and I'd like to get a better deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,150,000 represents a fair valuation of its unique qualities and the value it brings. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This offer reflects my best effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $1,120,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to propose a price of $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. While $1,080,000 is appealing, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,080,000 and $1,100,000, so I'll propose $1,090,000. This is my final offer.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
