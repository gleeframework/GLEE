"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is $1,000,000 to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given your own valuation of the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would still represent a substantial profit for you, and it's a fair price considering my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good deal for my product. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and my own valuation of the product.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $862,500. This would give you a healthy profit and represents a fair price considering my budget.  Let's try to close this deal.",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $880,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my own costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $862,500 and $880,000. I'm offering you $871,250. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",871250.0,Alice,5,
