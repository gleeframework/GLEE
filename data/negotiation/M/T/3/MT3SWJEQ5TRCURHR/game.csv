"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to go all the way to $175.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 just isn't going to work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?  That's still a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $140. How about we try $130? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
