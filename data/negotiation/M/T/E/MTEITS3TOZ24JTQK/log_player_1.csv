{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  I'm running out of time and leverage.
* **I've already made several concessions and don't see much room for further negotiation.**  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might lead to an even lower price.
* **John is offering me my minimum acceptable price and I'm guaranteed to get the deal done.**  There's no risk of further negotiation with John, so it's a safer and more reliable option.

**Strategy:**

* I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with and avoid further negotiation with Bob, which might result in a lower price.
* This decision is made considering the time constraint (we're in Round 8) and the potential risk of further negotiation with Bob."
