"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $60 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $85? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $72? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",72.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $72 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $80, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!",80.0,Alice,5,
