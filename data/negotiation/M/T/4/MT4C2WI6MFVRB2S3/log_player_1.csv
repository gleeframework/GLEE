Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will give you insight into his perceived value of the product. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, you can always lower the price or move on to John.
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of John's offer ($8,000), ensuring you won't be forced to sell below your minimum acceptable price."
