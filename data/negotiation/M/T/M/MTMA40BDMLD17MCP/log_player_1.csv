Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  I believe this price reflects the value I place on it and is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This price is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product, and I truly believe this is a deal we can both be happy with.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, the offers are increasing in smaller increments. It's unlikely we'll reach a price that significantly surpasses John's offer. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive the full value important to me."
