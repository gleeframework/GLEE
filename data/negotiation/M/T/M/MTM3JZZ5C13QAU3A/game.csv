"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $18,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $13,500? I'm trying to find a middle ground here.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about $16,000? This is a significant reduction from my original asking price and reflects my eagerness to do business with you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $16,000 is getting closer, it's still a stretch for me. How about we settle at $14,000? That would work for me and be a fair compromise I believe.",14000.0,Bob,6,
