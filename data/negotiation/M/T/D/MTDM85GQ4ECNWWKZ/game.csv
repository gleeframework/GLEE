"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $925,000. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from the value I have in mind. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's worth. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to move forward with the deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $885,000. This is a reasonable price that's fair to both of us. Let's close this deal and move on.",885000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $885,000. However, I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my target price. I can offer the product to you for $895,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",895000.0,Alice,7,
