"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but given my budget constraints, I can only consider a price up to $800,000 for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be delighted to proceed with the purchase.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $900,000 to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I value your willingness to negotiate. However, given my financial situation, I am unable to meet even $900,000. I would like to stick to my original budget of $800,000. If you could accommodate this, I would be more than happy to proceed with the purchase.",800000.0,Bob,4,
