"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for a price that's sure to be a great deal for both of us. I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and you have a backup option with John. By rejecting this initial offer, you might be able to get Alice to lower the price further."
