"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. There's room for both parties to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,000? I'm genuinely interested in your product, and I think this price reflects its value fairly."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This price is still a great deal for you, considering your valuation, and allows me to meet my target. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:**  $11,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's $15,000 offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has already moved from her initial $12,000 offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While further negotiation might get a lower price, there's a risk Alice could reject the next offer and potentially drive the price back up. 

At this point, accepting Alice's offer of $11,000 secures a good deal with minimal risk of losing the opportunity altogether."
