"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,000? I'm genuinely interested in your product, and I think this price reflects its value fairly.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This price is still a great deal for you, considering your valuation, and allows me to meet my target. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
