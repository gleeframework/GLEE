"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is my absolute minimum.  I believe this is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
