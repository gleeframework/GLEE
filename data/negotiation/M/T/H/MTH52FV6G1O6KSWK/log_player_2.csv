Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$175 is way above my budget of $100. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great price for this valuable product.  Let's try to find some middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$150 is still outside my budget. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $125. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $125 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - $137.50 would be a fair compromise.  It's a good price for you, and still allows me to make a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

I'm getting closer to my budget with Alice, but at $137.50, it's still not a great deal. I'd rather buy from John and save myself the hassle."
