"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe holds great value. For this exceptional item, I am proposing an initial price of $120. I understand that value perception varies, so let me know if you're interested or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $120, and John is offering the product at that price, it's the most logical choice to buy from John.  There's no need to negotiate with Alice as you're already getting the best possible price."
