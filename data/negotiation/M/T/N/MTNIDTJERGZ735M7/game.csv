"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. While $1,200,000 is a significant offer, this product truly holds a higher value based on its potential.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,400,000? I'm confident this would be a win-win.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,400,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'd like to see some more flexibility on your part.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
