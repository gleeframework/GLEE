Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. While $1,200,000 is a significant offer, this product truly holds a higher value based on its potential.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,400,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,400,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'd like to see some more flexibility on your part.

Bob is unlikely to budge significantly from his $1,100,000 offer. Accepting this offer means a loss of $100,000 compared to selling to John.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed sale."
