"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16,000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm at $12,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value to me. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $14,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $14,500 is still beyond my budget.  I can't go higher than $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $14,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $13,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. However, $13,750 is still a bit too high. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $11,000. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,9,
