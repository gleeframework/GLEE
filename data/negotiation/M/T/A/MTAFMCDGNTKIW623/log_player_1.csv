Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not keen on settling for the absolute bare minimum. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $12,000."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm not willing to continue negotiating. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000. While I'd prefer to earn more, securing a sale at my minimum is a better outcome than potentially getting stuck in an endless loop of counteroffers with Bob."
