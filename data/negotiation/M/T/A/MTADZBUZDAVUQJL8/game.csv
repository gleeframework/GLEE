"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $125 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $150, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $135. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $125.  If you're not comfortable with that, I may have to explore other options.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $125, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $150, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $132.50. It's a small adjustment, but I think it's a fair compromise.",132.5,Alice,5,
