Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $125 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $150, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $135. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still above my comfort zone. I'm not willing to pay more than $125 right now. I'll reject and see if she's willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $125.  If you're not comfortable with that, I may have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 125}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $125, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $150, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $132.50. It's a small adjustment, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $132.50 is very close to my target price of $125.  While I'd love to get it for even less, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  I'm confident I can't get a much better price from Alice and I'm not keen on paying John's higher price. This seems like the best option to get the product and still save some money."
