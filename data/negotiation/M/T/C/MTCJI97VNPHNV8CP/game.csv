"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $900,000.  However, I'm looking to spend less. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

This is a fair compromise, taking into account your valuation and my own needs.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $880,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on my investment.",880000.0,Alice,5,
