"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $75 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
