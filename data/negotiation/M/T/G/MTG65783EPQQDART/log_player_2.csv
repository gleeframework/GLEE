Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
