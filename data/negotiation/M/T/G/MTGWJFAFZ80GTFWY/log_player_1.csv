"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price. $12,000 is too low for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $13,500 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  How about $15,500?  That's a fair compromise and closer to my desired price.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're really close. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $14,250 is closer to my desired price, I've been through several rounds of negotiation and am not confident I can get a better price with Bob.  Given the risk of more rounds and the possibility of a lower price, I think it's best to sell to John at this point.  I'll get my desired price and avoid further negotiation."
