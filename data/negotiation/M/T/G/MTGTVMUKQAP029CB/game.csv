"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth significantly more. Let's meet in the middle. How about $850,000? This price acknowledges the value to both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $750,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. If you're serious about this product, I believe this is a price we can both agree on.",800000.0,Alice,5,
