"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the condition of the product, but I can't afford $9,500. My budget allows me to spend up to $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go down to $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,750? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I've been considering the value of the product and my budget, and I'd like to propose $8,500. This would allow us to stay within my financial limits while still being fair to you.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about $8,625? It's a small increase from your last offer, but still gives you a great deal, and gets me closer to what I need.",8625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your latest proposal. I've thought about it carefully, and I'd like to counter with $8,600. This keeps us moving forward in our negotiations while respecting both of our financial positions.",8600.0,Bob,6,
