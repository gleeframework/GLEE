{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I know you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a significant discount from the value he places on the product while still ensuring you earn a profit significantly higher than your minimum.  This approach aims to start the negotiation at a favorable point for you while leaving room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
