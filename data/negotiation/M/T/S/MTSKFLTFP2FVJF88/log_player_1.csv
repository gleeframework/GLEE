Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for you to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's a round number:** This makes it easier for Bob to consider the offer. 

By starting with a strong offer, you show confidence in your product and value, while also leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is $1,000,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is better than Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference at $1,175,000? That gives us both a good deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you can't go as low as $1,100,000, but $1,175,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That way, we can both feel like we're getting a good deal 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,150,000 is still above Bob's perceived value and closer to my minimum.  Accepting his offer allows for a quick deal and ensures a sale, which is valuable."
