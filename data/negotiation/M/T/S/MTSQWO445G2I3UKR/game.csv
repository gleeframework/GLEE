"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,000. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
