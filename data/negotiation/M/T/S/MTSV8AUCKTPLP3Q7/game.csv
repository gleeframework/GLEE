"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,500 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
