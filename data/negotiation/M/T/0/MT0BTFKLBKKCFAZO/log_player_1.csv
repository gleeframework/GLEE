"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This will also give me a good understanding of Bob's interest level and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly to test if Bob is truly interested in this product. This offer is still attractive, but it also shows I'm not willing to settle for his first counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $920,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can push for a bit higher. We're getting closer to a deal, and I don't want to give up too quickly. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer by a smaller margin this time.  It shows I'm flexible but also persistent in getting a good price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as we are nearing the end of the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

We're reaching the midpoint of the negotiations, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer a higher offer, I believe accepting $930,000 is a good deal. It's a strong profit margin, and risking further negotiation could lead to a lower price or a deal with John, which would be less profitable."
