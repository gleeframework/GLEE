Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $150, which is a good starting point. It's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fantastic"" nature of the product to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to counteroffer if he's interested but not at the initial price. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation strong while leaving room for flexibility if Bob is a tough negotiator."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value Met:** Bob's offer of $120 matches my minimum value for the product. 
* **Potential for Loss:**  While I could try to negotiate higher, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Holding out could mean losing the sale entirely and being forced to sell to John for the same price. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
