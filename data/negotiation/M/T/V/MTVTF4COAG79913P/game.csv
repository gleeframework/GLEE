"Hi Alice,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you closer to your budget. Would you be willing to pay $13,000 for it?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
