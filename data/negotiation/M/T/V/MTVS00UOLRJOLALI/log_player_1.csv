"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit.  It's important to start with a reasonable price, as Bob may be more willing to negotiate if he feels the starting point isn't too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be open to $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's not worth selling to him for that price, as I'd be losing money. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering at $107.50, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $107.50 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a good deal for both of us, and it leaves room for us to both be happy with the sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm still determined to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still below what I need.  Let's try $100. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counteroffering at $100,  which is a bit closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still stuck at $90. It's the most I can afford right now, and I think it's a fair offer considering the value of the product for me.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for $90.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my goal in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $95, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows further willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit. With only a few rounds left, I need to find a compromise that works for both of us."
