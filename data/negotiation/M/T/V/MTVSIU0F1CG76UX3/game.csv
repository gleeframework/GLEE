"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is still a great price for you considering the value of this product. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $9,500? I'm serious about buying and I think this would be a fair deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 just isn't enough. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price. I can do $10,000, which is my absolute limit. I believe it's a fair offer considering the current market and the value it holds for me. If this works for you, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",10000.0,Bob,6,
