"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than my actual budget. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** I understand that Alice won't accept this offer, but it shows I'm serious about buying and willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is still a great price for you considering the value of this product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice has moved from her initial offer, $14,000 is still considerably more than both my budget and John's alternative offer. 
* **Continued Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's room for the price to come down further. I'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $9,500? I'm serious about buying and I think this would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but strategically staying well below my $10,000 maximum. 
* **Show Willingness:** This counter-offer shows Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price, but I'm still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  Highlighting ""fairness"" reminds Alice that a deal benefits both parties.  I'm hoping to appeal to her desire for a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 just isn't enough. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic to pressure me. However, I still have rounds to negotiate and a viable alternative with John.
* **Still Above Budget:**  Even though Alice has come down, $12,000 is still $2,000 over my budget.
* **Testing the Waters:** I need to see if she's truly firm on her ""final offer"" or if there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price. I can do $10,000, which is my absolute limit. I believe it's a fair offer considering the current market and the value it holds for me. If this works for you, I'm ready to close the deal right now."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Revealed:**  I'm now revealing my maximum budget. This shows Alice I'm serious and not trying to lowball her endlessly. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating I'm ""ready to close the deal right now,"" I'm adding a bit of pressure and emphasizing my commitment if she accepts.
* **Justification:** I'm giving a reason for my offer (""current market"") to make it seem less arbitrary.
* **Backup Plan:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John for $10,000."
