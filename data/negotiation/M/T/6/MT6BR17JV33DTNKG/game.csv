"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  My initial asking price is $1,200,000. This reflects the true value I see in the product. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial asking price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's not quite where I need to be to move forward.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I value your perspective, $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's try $1,000,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to move forward and you to get a valuable product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",975000.0,Bob,6,
