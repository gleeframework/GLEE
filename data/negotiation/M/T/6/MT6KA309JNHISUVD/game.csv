"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $1,250,000? That's as high as I can go.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise a little further, how about $1,300,000? This would be a good deal for both of us and get this transaction completed.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here. $1,275,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,290,000. Let's close this deal. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move on from here.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,290,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1280000.0,Bob,8,
