Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob values the product highly and is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000.  This is a compromise,  showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for further negotiation.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:

Bob has moved up to $16,000, which is closer to my ideal price and significantly more than John's offer. I'm going to accept this offer, as it's a good compromise and secures a profit for me."
