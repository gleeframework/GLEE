"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a rare and valuable item. I'm thinking of a price of $20000 for the product. Is this something you'd like to consider?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. Can you consider that?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $18000 for the product?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $16000. Can you consider that?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $16000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we discuss a price of $17500 for the product?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $16500. Can you consider that?",16500.0,Bob,6,
