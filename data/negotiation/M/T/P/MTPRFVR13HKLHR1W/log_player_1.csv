Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding that you have a backup offer. This gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob. Since Bob values the product at $12,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $10,000.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this is a competitive offer."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is polite, professional, and highlights the value to Bob. 
* **Product Price ($11,500):** This price is strategically chosen:
    * **Above your minimum:** You ensure a profit even if Bob rejects the offer.
    * **Below Bob's valuation:** It leaves Bob with a potential ""gain"" ($500) if he accepts.
    * **Close to the middle:**  It suggests fairness and a willingness to negotiate, but not by much.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower price.

Let me know what Bob says!"
