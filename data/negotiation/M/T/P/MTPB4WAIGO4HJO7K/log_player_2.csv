"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is worth an incredible $10,000 to you. I'm confident it will meet all your needs and expectations. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's very close to John's offer, leaving little room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down significantly in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $7,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's a negotiation tactic to start with a lower offer than what you're willing to pay. This gives you room to move up and still potentially get a good deal.
* **Significant Difference:** Offering $7,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's $9,500. This might incentivize her to negotiate more seriously, especially if she's eager to sell. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer gauges Alice's flexibility. If she's completely unwilling to budge from her initial price, it might be a sign that a deal won't be possible within my desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. In order to find a mutually beneficial solution, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $8,200 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but very slowly. Her counter-offer is closer to her value ($8,000) than to my initial offer.  There's still room for negotiation. I need to show her I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,200 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500. However, I need to be realistic about my budget. If we can't find a price that works for both of us soon, I might need to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but only by a small amount ($500). This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm serious about my budget limitations.
* **Introducing Time Pressure:**  By mentioning other options and the need for a quicker agreement, I'm adding a bit of time pressure to the negotiation. This might encourage Alice to be more flexible if she truly wants to close the deal. 
* **Staying Below John's Offer:** It's important to keep my offers below John's $10,000 price. Otherwise, there's no incentive to negotiate with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering my proposal, Bob. I value your interest in our product and respect your financial constraints. In light of this, I am willing to negotiate further. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $8,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her value for the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll become frustrated and break off the negotiation. Accepting this offer guarantees a savings of $2,000 compared to John's price."
