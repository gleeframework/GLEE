{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is far too expensive for me at $1,800,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a very low offer, $1,000,000. I know this is a very aggressive price, but I'm hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate. I'm also aware that I can always buy from John for $1,000,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk here."

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's getting closer. I will try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm increasing my offer to $1,200,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer.  Hopefully, this shows good faith and encourages Alice to meet me in the middle."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is still asking for too much.  I'll try to negotiate a bit lower, but if she doesn't budge I'm ready to go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to $1,300,000, which is still lower than Alice's latest offer, but shows that I'm willing to compromise. I'm getting close to my limit, but I want to see if we can reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm still not ready to pay $1,400,000.  I'll try one more counteroffer, but if Alice doesn't come down I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm raising my offer to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still within my budget. It's time for Alice to meet me halfway. If she rejects this offer, I'm going to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit. While Alice's price is getting closer to my ideal, I'm concerned that we won't reach an agreement in time. With only one round left, the risk of not getting the product is too high.  It's time to secure the deal and buy from John."
