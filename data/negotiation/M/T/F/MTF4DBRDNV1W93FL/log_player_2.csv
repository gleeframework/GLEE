# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $15,000, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $15,000.  There's a good chance you can negotiate Alice down further from her initial offer."
