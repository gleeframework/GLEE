"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value it holds for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still reflects the significant value this product brings to your business, while also allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This is a more reasonable price for me, considering the value I expect to get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This represents a fair compromise, acknowledging both the value of the product and your budget. I believe this is the best way to move forward.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'd like to propose a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I expect to get from the product, and it's still within my budget.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but I need to stay firm on my price.  $925,000 is just too low for me. Let's try $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows me to meet my financial needs while still offering you a valuable product. It's a win-win scenario for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I'm still not willing to go above $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $950,000, so I'll propose a price of $937,500. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",937500.0,Bob,8,
