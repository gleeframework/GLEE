I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it's more than Bob values the product at, but it's also significantly less than my minimum price of $15,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still leaving me a comfortable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,500. This is a compromise, but it's still a good price for me and leaves some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's still a fair price for me. If Bob doesn't accept, I'm willing to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my price, and I've already made significant compromises. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
