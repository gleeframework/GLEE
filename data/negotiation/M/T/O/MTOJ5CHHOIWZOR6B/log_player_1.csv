{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $130 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  It's also friendly and encouraging, which may make Bob more likely to accept or counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $118?  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 118}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've already gone down from my initial asking price and I'm not confident I can get any closer to my desired value with Bob. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed sale to John for $120."
