Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,200. I'm willing to come down to $7,250, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time!

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $7,250.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation when you have a guaranteed offer for $8,000 from John."
