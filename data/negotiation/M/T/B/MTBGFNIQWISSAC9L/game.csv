"Hi Alice, $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's still a great price for a quality product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $110 is a little out of my budget.  How about $108? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109. This is my final offer.",109.0,Alice,5,
