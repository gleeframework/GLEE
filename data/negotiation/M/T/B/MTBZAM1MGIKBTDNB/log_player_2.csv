"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, it's not the best deal. He can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a price closer to Alice's minimum value of $12,000. A counteroffer of $13,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject his counteroffer and the price could increase again.  Additionally, the offer is within his budget, and he's saving $1,500 compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer minimizes risk and saves him money."
