(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer ($100)** is within your budget of $120.
* You can save $20 by accepting Alice's offer compared to buying from John. 
* Even though the product is only worth $80 to Alice, it's worth $120 to you, so a price of $100 is still a good deal."
