"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I believe it's worth considering at a price of $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at around $9,000. Would you consider an offer in that range?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  I could see myself going up to $10,000, but that's really my limit.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us, considering the value it holds for you and the price I'm willing to accept.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I could potentially stretch my budget to $11,000, but that's absolutely my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, but I'm still not willing to go below $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm afraid we're too far apart.  My absolute best offer is $11,500.  If you can't accept that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",11500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I can meet you at $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm hoping we can finally make a deal.",12000.0,Alice,9,
