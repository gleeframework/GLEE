Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you at $700,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is already a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?
