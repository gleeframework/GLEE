Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to get a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, there's still space to negotiate down towards his perceived value of $100 without going below your minimum.
* **Confidence:** Offering a higher price initially can also signal that you believe in the value of your product.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. The best approach can depend on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and your risk tolerance."
