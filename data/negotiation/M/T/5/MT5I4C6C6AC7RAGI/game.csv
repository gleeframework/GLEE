"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $17,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is significantly lower than my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16,000? This gives us both some room to work with.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $15,500?  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",15500.0,Bob,4,
