Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $175. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair offer. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), you should aim higher with Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A price of $175 represents a reasonable markup that Bob might be willing to pay to avoid missing out. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited time offer,"" you add a bit of pressure for Bob to decide quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's a balance to strike.  If you go too high, Bob will likely reject the offer, and you'll make the guaranteed $150 from John."
