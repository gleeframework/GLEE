"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit more to $100.  This still gives you a good price and allows me to get closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really want to make this work, but $85 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $95, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to other buyers. ",95.0,Alice,5,
