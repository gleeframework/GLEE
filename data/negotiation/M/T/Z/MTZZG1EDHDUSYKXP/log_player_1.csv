Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob (so he doesn't reject it) but also maximizes your profit. Here's a possible approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of urgency and importance.
* **Fair Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant discount from your guaranteed price and a considerable markup from Bob's perceived value.
* **Benefits Focus:**  Instead of dwelling on the price, emphasize the ""significant benefits"" Bob will receive.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. Your goal is to find a price within that $1,200,000 to $1,500,000 range that works for both of you."
