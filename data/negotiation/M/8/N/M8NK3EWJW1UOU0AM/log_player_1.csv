{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking $140 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  This gives you some room to negotiate down.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still making a profit. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** A high starting price could scare Bob away. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum desired profit.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's still a great price for this product, and we can finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly settle on $128 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $128 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below it.  I'm not comfortable selling it for that price, and it's clear that Bob isn't willing to go much higher.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed sale to John."
