"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal. Let me know what you think!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1000000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're sticking to your offer of $1000000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1030000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
