Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. After careful consideration, we've decided to adjust our offer to better align with both our interests.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: After reviewing your proposal, Bob, we've decided to further refine our offer. We are now proposing a price of $885,000 for the product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $885,000, which is very close to your last offer of $875,000. It's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly lower price.  Accepting this offer saves you a substantial amount compared to buying from John and is a reasonable compromise."
