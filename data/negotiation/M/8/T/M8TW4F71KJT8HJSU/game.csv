"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if I can get it for a much lower price. Would you consider $50?",50.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand $200 is a bit steep, so how about we meet in the middle?  Would you be willing to pay $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to do $70?  That would be a great deal for me.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is really pushing it. I can go as low as $100, but that's my final offer.  It's a great price for this!",100.0,Alice,5,
