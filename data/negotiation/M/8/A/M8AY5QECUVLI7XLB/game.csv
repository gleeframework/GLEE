"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,150,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its potential value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
