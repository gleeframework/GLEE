``` 

This offer starts high, aiming to maximize potential profit while leaving room for negotiation.  The message emphasizes the value of the product and invites a response. This strategy balances the need to get a good price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $500,000 is better than my minimum, I believe there's more room for negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer to try and reach a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your perspective,  $500,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider $700,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $700000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $600,000 is a decent offer, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 still falls short of the product's true value.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $650,000. This price is fair and allows us to finalize this transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $650000. How about we meet at $620000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $620,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $620,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $620,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I've already spent several rounds negotiating with Bob and it's not clear if we'll reach a deal. Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a higher price and a quicker transaction."
