"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by showing Bob's willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant price reduction. The offer is below Alice's value of $8,000, making it potentially appealing to her, but still allows room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his ideal value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  This counteroffer is a smaller step closer to Alice's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong bargaining position. It also demonstrates that Bob is serious about closing the deal."
