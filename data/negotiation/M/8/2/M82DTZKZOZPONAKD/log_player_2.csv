"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate but I have the backup option of buying from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to leave room for negotiation and signal that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The tone remains friendly and suggests this counteroffer is a starting point. 
* **Strategic Goal:** My ideal outcome is to buy the product somewhere between my initial offer and my maximum budget of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not quite:** Alice is getting closer to my acceptable range, but $85 is still above what I can get it from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are several rounds left, and her willingness to negotiate suggests I might be able to get the price down further. 
* **John as Leverage:** I'll use the option of buying from John as leverage to encourage Alice to come down closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about $75? That's a significant increase from my last offer and would allow us to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($85) and my previous counteroffer ($65). 
* **Urgency and Compromise:** The message emphasizes my desire to close the deal and highlights the compromise I'm making.
* **Staying Below John's Price:**  While I'm aiming for a deal, I'm still staying below my $80 alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $75 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $80? This would be a good compromise, and we could finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching My Limit:** Alice has come down to my exact budget and is offering the same price I can get from John. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:** There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Closing the Deal:** It makes sense to accept this offer and secure the product at my target price."
