"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob in my message, hoping to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $60. It's far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to give up the product for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering with $85. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. I'm also emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for both of us to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about $75? That's a significant increase from my last offer and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal outcome. I want to see if I can push Bob further.  I'm not desperate to sell yet, so I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $75 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $80? This would be a good compromise, and we could finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm counteroffering with $80. It's a small concession but keeps the price closer to my minimum. Emphasizing the ""compromise"" aspect can make it more appealing to Bob."
