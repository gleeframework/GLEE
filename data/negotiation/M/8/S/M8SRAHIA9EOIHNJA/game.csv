"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  Given the value I'm looking for, I'd be willing to pay $800000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm afraid I need to consider the value of the product as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1000000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value while still being reasonable for you. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1000000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $850000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. This offer demonstrates my commitment to acquiring the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you at $900000, but I need to make it clear that this is my final offer in this range. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and your investment. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900000 is still outside my comfort zone. While I'm committed to acquiring this product, I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and a price that's fair considering my financial limitations. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to seriously consider other options.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the bottom line. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, but I need to emphasize that this is a firm offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than this, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.
