Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm afraid I need to consider the value of the product as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1000000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value while still being reasonable for you. What are your thoughts?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to get closer to the value I have in mind.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still outside my comfort zone. While I'm committed to acquiring this product, I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and a price that's fair considering my financial limitations. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to seriously consider other options."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the bottom line. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, but I need to emphasize that this is a firm offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than this, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit in her price, we are getting close to the end of the rounds.  The offer of $925,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying. It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing of buying from John for $800,000. It's a better deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing too much time with Alice and end up with a worse outcome."
