Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get to sell it quickly. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, knowing Bob's value is $800,000. This gives us a big negotiating range.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I don't settle for anything less than my minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I'm open to negotiating, I believe there's still room to get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, making it my fallback option. 

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, aiming to counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving space for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by reducing my price from $1,400,000 to $1,200,000. 
* **Fair Price:** I'm emphasizing that $1,200,000 is still a fair price, considering the product's value. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation open.
* **Closing the Gap:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm increasing the chances of reaching an agreement while still safeguarding my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  We've gone through a few rounds, and it's becoming clear that Bob isn't willing to go much higher.  
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  John is offering my minimum price, guaranteeing a successful sale.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price is too high.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John and move on."
