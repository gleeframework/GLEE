"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm counteroffering $850,000. This is the best price I can offer at this point.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000 for the product. This is a good compromise, and I believe it reflects the fair value for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I'm counteroffering $825,000. This is the best price I can offer at this point.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.
