{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 6

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $775,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is now back to her initial offer from round 1.  While I'd prefer to pay less, we're getting close to the end of our negotiations. If I reject this offer, I risk either reaching a stalemate or having to buy from John for a significantly higher price. 

Given the limited rounds remaining, accepting Alice's offer is the most practical decision. It secures the product at a price that's still within my budget and avoids the risk of a worse outcome."
