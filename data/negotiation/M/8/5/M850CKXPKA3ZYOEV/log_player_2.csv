"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This represents a substantial value for you, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You value the product at $1,200,000 and Alice is asking for $1,000,000. This leaves significant room for negotiation.
* **There's potential for a better deal.** Since you know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, you can counteroffer with a price closer to that value, aiming to secure a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If negotiation with Alice fails, you have the option of buying from John, but it's less ideal due to the higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the value to both of us, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Given the significant value this product offers you, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price.**  The price dropped to $950,000 from $1,000,000, which is a positive step.
* **The risk of further negotiation is high.** If you reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and you might end up having to pay John's price of $1,200,000.
* **It's a good compromise.** While you could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer secures the product at a price that is within your budget and significantly lower than what you'd pay John."
