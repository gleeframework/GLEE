,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,750.  How about we settle on $11,250? This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,250 and $11,750, which would be $11,500. Let's try that.",11500.0,Alice,7,
