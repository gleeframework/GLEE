"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",2000000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1500000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $1500000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1800000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1800000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm starting to think we're close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in this product at this price. Let me know what you think.",1700000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1700000. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. If I don't get a better price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",1600000.0,Bob,6,,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1600000 and $1700000, which is $1650000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling to John for $1500000. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,7,,
