"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our negotiations."", 
 ""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" I aim to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""fair starting point for our negotiations"" explicitly signals my willingness to discuss the price further.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob accepts my initial offer, I gain a significant profit.
2. **Gather information:** Bob's reaction to this high price will provide valuable insights into his negotiation style and how much he might be willing to pay. 
3. **Maintain a strong position:** Starting high allows me to gradually concede throughout the negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His message suggests he might be willing to go slightly higher than $1,200,000, especially since he emphasized it as his upper limit. I'll aim to negotiate a price closer to $1,500,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table and recognizing the value of this product.  While your offer is generous, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,600,000. This reflects the true potential and scarcity of what I'm offering. Would you be willing to consider a figure in that range?"",
 ""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I start by showing appreciation for Bob's offer, creating a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Holding firm but compromising:** I haven't agreed to his $1,200,000 but reduced my asking price considerably from $1,800,000, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Open-ended question:** Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation active.

By aiming for $1,600,000, I'm setting a target that allows for potential compromises in later rounds while still securing a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to $1,600,000, but I'm afraid I'm still at $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now repeated his $1,200,000 offer twice and emphasized it as his upper limit. This suggests he might be firm on this price. However, I still have some leverage as he hasn't walked away from the negotiation. I'll use my next counteroffer to signal a willingness to compromise but also show that I'm prepared to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to make this work, so I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. However, I need to be transparent â€“ this is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to explore other options."",
 ""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Finality:** This offer splits the difference between our previous positions, demonstrating significant movement on my part.  Crucially, I'm stating this is my ""final offer"" to convey seriousness and a sense of urgency.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning ""other options,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob about John's offer without explicitly using it as a threat. This reinforces the limited time frame and encourages him to make a decision.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a profitable deal:**  $1,400,000 still represents a substantial profit above my minimum.
2. **Apply pressure without being aggressive:** I'm not resorting to threats but creating a clear choice for Bob: accept a reasonable final offer or risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still at $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now repeated his $1,200,000 offer multiple times and keeps reiterating it's his final price.  He hasn't shown any willingness to budge beyond this point. 

Crucially, I presented my ""final offer"" in Round 5 at $1,400,000, and he rejected it.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome than what I already have secured with John. 

Therefore, it's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and sell the product to John for my guaranteed $1,200,000."
