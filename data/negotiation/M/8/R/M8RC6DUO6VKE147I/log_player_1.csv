Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for a product worth at least $15,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is still higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $12,000 is still above your minimum of $15,000.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It shows you are willing to negotiate but also that the product has value.

This allows for a potential negotiation, while ensuring that you're not immediately giving away too much of your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $12,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss. 

I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While John is offering $15,000, I want to see if I can get closer to that amount with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $9,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my initial offer of $12,000. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved a bit closer with his offer of $9,800, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not confident I can get him to budge further, and I don't want to risk spending more time negotiating only to end up with a lower price.  John has already offered my desired price, so it's in my best interest to sell to him and secure the $15,000."
