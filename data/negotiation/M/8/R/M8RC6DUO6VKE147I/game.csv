"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $9,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my initial offer of $12,000. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9800.0,Bob,4,
