"Alice, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm very interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  This price is still a good value for you and gives me a significant saving.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
