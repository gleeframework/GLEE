Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth without immediately going to John as my backup.
* **Being friendly:** A friendly tone in the message can help build rapport and potentially lead to a more agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $8,000 is my floor, it's not a profitable outcome. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, as he acknowledges the product's value.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer maintains my position and allows me to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my minimum:** $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing value:** I remind Bob of the product's value, trying to justify the higher price.
* **Friendly tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation open and positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $9,500 is closer to what I'm looking to spend, I still believe we could reach an agreement that suits both of us. I would like to propose $9,000 as a counteroffer. This price respects the value you place on the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Further negotiation unlikely to yield much:** Bob has shown he's willing to go up to $9,000, but may not budge further. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation might lead to a stalemate or even a lower offer. 

At this point, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option, as it guarantees a profitable sale and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
