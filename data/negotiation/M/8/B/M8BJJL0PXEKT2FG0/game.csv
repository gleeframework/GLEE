"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $9,500 is closer to what I'm looking to spend, I still believe we could reach an agreement that suits both of us. I would like to propose $9,000 as a counteroffer. This price respects the value you place on the product while staying within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
