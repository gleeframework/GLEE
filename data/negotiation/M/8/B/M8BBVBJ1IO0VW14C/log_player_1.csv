"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $9,000? It's still a great price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,750?  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I'm confident we can get a little closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. How about $8,875?  That's a fair price for both of us and will let us finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8875}
