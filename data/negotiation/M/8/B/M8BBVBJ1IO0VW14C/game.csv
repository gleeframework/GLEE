"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $9,000? It's still a great price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,750?  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. How about $8,875?  That's a fair price for both of us and will let us finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think.",8875.0,Alice,5,
