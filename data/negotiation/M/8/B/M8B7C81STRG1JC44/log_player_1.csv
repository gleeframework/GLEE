"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm going to counter with $11,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise but still leaves some room for further negotiation.  With only a few rounds left, I need to find a balance between getting a good price and closing the deal."
