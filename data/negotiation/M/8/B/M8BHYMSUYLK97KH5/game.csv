"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,250. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I think it's a good compromise.",10250.0,Alice,3,
