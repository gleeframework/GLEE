Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go any lower, Bob. But I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $145. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to budge much further, and while getting the product for $145 is okay, getting it for $100 is the best possible outcome for me."
