"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $20000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $17500. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're open to this, we can finalize the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $12000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet halfway at $14500. This is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14500 is closer, my budget is firmly set at $12000. I'm hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap. If you accept my offer, I'm ready to finalize the deal today.",12000.0,Bob,6,
