"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price. It also shows Bob that I value the product highly and am not afraid to ask for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get more. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering with $1,200,000.  This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I want to show him I'm willing to compromise but also that I still believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price than my minimum.  It's worth taking this offer rather than risking further negotiations. I could get a higher price, but there's also a risk of losing the deal entirely and having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000."
