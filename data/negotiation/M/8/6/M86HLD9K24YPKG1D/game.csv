"Alice, $16,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still above what I can comfortably spend.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to go with another seller.",8000.0,Bob,4,
