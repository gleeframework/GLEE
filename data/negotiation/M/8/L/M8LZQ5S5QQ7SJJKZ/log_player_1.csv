I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if I don't get a satisfactory price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I can sell to John for $10,000, I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer yet. It's too low. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $12,000. This is still above my minimum, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. I'm willing to take a slight loss, but $9,000 is too far below my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000."
