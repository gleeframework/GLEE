Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.

While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'll reject and see if we can get closer to my desired price."

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still too high for me. While it's closer to my budget, I'm not willing to go above $12,000. At this point, it's better for me to go with John's offer of $8,000 and save some money."
