Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before anyone else. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While Bob values the product at $8,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay slightly more if he perceives it as a good deal or wants to avoid missing out.  
* **Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice is secure knowing she can sell it to John for her minimum acceptable price."
