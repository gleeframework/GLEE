"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in similar sales. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000, my final price. It's fair considering the value you've placed on the product and it's the maximum I'm able to spend.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've reached your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
