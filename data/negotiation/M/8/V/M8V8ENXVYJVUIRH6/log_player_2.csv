Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in similar sales. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He is willing to pay $1,000,000, and Alice is asking for $1,050,000. It's still worthwhile to see if he can get a lower price, even if it's only slightly lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you've reached your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's final offer of $1,025,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, which is a better deal for Bob."
