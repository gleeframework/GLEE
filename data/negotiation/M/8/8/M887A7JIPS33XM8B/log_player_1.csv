Round 2

# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality you mentioned, $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 at this time.  Let me know if that's a starting point we can work with.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
