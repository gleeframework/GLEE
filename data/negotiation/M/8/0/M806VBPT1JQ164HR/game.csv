"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is quite a bit more than I'm looking to spend. This product would be valuable to me at a price closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still more than I can justify. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000, which I believe is a fair price. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
