"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I believe you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your $1,000,000 budget and a significant savings compared to buying from John."
