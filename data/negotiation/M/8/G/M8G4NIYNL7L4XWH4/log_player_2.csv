"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for negotiation:**  $1,100,000 is a good price, but you're still paying more than Alice values the product.
* **You have leverage:** You can always go to John for $1,500,000, so Alice has an incentive to come down in price.

**Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, you open the door to a negotiation where you can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer to your desired price:** Her counteroffer of $1,050,000 is significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to your counteroffer of $1,000,000.
* **The risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's also the risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise or you might end up wasting time.
* **John's offer is still a backup:**  You can still go to John if you don't reach an agreement with Alice, so you have a safety net.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer at $1,050,000 seems like a good compromise that saves you a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
