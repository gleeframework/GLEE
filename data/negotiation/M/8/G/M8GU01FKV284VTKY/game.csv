"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000, which is fair considering the value I place on it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1250000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $1125000.  This seems like a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer to a deal. While $1200000 is still a little high for me, I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This seems like a reasonable compromise, and I hope we can finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1175000, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
