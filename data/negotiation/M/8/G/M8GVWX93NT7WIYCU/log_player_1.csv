Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my potential profit.
* **Building interest:** I'm framing the message in a way that highlights the potential value of the product to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using language that makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, avoiding a hard-line stance that could lead to a stalemate. 
* **Knowing my backup:** While I'm optimistic about selling to Bob, I have a backup buyer in John. This gives me confidence to negotiate assertively, knowing I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be interested in purchasing it for $15000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not satisfied with accepting it right away.  There's a chance I can get closer to my initial asking price of $20,000.  I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more profit by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $17,500 to make this deal work.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing a willingness to compromise by meeting him halfway. 
* **Justifying the price:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** While lowering my price, I'm still aiming for a profit higher than my minimum. This keeps some leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $15000.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is firm on his offer of $15,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a higher price.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John.  This decision ensures I meet my minimum desired profit and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation with an uncertain outcome."
