"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be interested in purchasing it for $15000. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $15000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $17500 to make this deal work.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair compromise. What do you say?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $15000.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",15000.0,Bob,4,
