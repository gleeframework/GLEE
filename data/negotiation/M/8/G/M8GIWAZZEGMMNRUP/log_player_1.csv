{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a higher price from Bob. While $80 is a good price, I can still potentially make more."

Round 3

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a bit closer to my desired price.  While $78 is tempting, I believe I can still get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $78 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $82.  Let's try to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 82} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $79 is a decent price, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  John is a safe bet and guarantees me $80, which is my minimum goal."
