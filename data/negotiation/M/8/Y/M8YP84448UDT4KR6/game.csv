"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1300000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still allows you to acquire a valuable product within a reasonable range. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $1250000 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1275000?  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to  move forward with the sale. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
