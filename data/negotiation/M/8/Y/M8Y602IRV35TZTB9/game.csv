"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. Let's see if we can close the gap.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
