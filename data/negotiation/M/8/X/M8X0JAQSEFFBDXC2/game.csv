"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $800000, and I'm offering it to you first. My initial price is $1200000. I'm open to negotiating, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While it's closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $1000000? This would be a significant investment for you, and I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
