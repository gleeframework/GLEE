Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $140 is higher than Bob's $120 value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $140 is above your minimum of $150, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It shows flexibility:**  It implies you are willing to negotiate further."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $130 for the product. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to try to push for a higher price. I'll counter his offer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $135?  It's still a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider $135, but let's see if we can find common ground. Would you be open to discussing a price of $132 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  It's a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer, and it's the most I can get for the product at this point."
