"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $142 is still higher than my ideal price, but it's closer to my value of the product ($150). Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.  Considering the potential for further negotiation to be unsuccessful, I'm choosing to accept Alice's offer."
