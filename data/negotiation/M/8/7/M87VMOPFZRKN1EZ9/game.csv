"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I could consider $875,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I believe the product is valuable, $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? I feel this is a fair offer that respects the value of your product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a significant gap from what I believe is a fair reflection of its worth. To be candid, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. I'm willing to let this go for $850,000, but this is my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. However, the price difference is still quite significant for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,6,
