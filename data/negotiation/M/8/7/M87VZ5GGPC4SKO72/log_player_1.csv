Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This is because I have a safety net with John's offer, so I can afford to be more aggressive. I want to see how interested Bob is and gauge his potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value and even lower than what John is offering. I'm rejecting this offer and will try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is still above my minimum, but a compromise from my initial offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob, while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and it's getting closer to John's offer.  I'm choosing to sell to John at this point.  While I would prefer to get more, it's better to guarantee the $10,000 rather than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with less."
