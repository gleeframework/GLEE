Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This allows room for negotiation and hopefully reflects the potential value of the product to Bob.  If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm counter-offering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired value and higher than what John would pay.  It's in my best interest to accept his offer and close the deal."
