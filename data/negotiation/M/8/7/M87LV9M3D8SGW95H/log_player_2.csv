"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer because you can get the product for cheaper from John ($15,000) if you can't negotiate a better price with Alice.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than your initial counteroffer of $10,000. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before buying from John. There's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. I can offer it to you for $11,000. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great price for a product worth $15,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down to $11,000, which is only $1,000 higher than your last counteroffer.  This is a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than the $15,000 you'd pay John. You've saved a good amount of money.  It's likely that Alice won't come down further, so accepting the offer is the best course of action."
