"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's meet in the middle!",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. I can offer it to you for $11,000. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great price for a product worth $15,000 to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
