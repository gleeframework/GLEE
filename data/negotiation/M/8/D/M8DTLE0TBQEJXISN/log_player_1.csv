Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate and creates the perception of value. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $1,900,000, you establish a high anchor point, which can influence Bob's perception of a ""fair"" price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions openness to discussion, signaling to Bob that there's flexibility in the price.
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000, ensuring you don't settle for less than your product's worth to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me, but I am very interested in the product.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,200,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. Accepting his initial offer would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's value. To move this forward, I could consider $1,700,000. This still reflects a considerable investment but acknowledges your interest."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:** This counteroffer drastically lowers the price from your initial offer to show flexibility but remains well above both your $1,500,000 minimum and closer to your initial ask. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value reminds Bob of its worth and justifies a price higher than his offer.
* **Positioning:** By framing the lower price as acknowledging his interest, you maintain a collaborative tone while still advocating for your position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That price is still a little high for me. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While you could potentially negotiate for more, Bob has shown a willingness to move closer to your price range. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely by pushing for a higher price that Bob might reject."
