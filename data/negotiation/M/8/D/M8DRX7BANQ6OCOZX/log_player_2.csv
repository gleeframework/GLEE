"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, you can potentially do better by negotiating. You know John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, so you have a benchmark to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise. This is a one-time offer, so let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to your target, you can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. John's offer of $1,000,000 is still a viable option if you can't reach a better agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair offer, considering both our positions. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still a little ways off from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a good deal for both of us, so let's close this and move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. While you could continue to negotiate, the price is now at a point where it's likely you won't be able to get a better deal. Alice is offering a price that is very close to your target of $1,000,000, and there is a risk of her rejecting further counteroffers or ending the negotiation altogether. It's best to accept the offer and avoid potentially losing out on a good deal."
