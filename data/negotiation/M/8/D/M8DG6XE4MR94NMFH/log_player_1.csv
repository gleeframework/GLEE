{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is advantageous to you but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob.  It also highlights the value Bob will gain by purchasing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. It's a bit above the value you mentioned, but I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product like this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it is likely that he will not go any higher. Accepting his offer maximizes my profit."
