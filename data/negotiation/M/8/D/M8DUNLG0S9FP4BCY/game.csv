"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I recognize its value, I'm not quite ready to commit to that price point. To start, I'd like to offer $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price from there.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I see you recognize the product's potential. While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, I'm confident the true worth of this product is closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $1,325,000? I'm aiming for a win-win here.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's find a solution in this range.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position on $1,325,000. How about we meet halfway at $1,287,500?  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget constraints. ",1287500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer and the compromise. However, I'm still a little high at $1,287,500.  I'm willing to go to $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering both our positions.  Let's find a final solution here.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
