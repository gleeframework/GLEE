"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something valuable. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm not willing to go above $850,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and represents a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession to reach an agreement. I'll make a counteroffer of $975,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
