Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as high as $7,800, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $8,100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:

``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $8,100 secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of the price going up or losing the deal entirely."
