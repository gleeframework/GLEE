Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it could be equally valuable to you. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential benefits far outweigh the price. Let me know if you'd like to discuss the details further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000 offer:** This price is higher than the guaranteed price from John, giving me the potential for a larger profit.  
* **Emphasis on value:** The message highlights the product's value to me, subtly implying it could be similarly valuable to Bob. This creates a sense of urgency and potential for higher bids. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for discussion, potentially leading to a higher price if Bob is genuinely interested.

**Note:** This is a strategic starting point.  The actual price I would offer would depend on my assessment of Bob's potential interest and the negotiation dynamics."
