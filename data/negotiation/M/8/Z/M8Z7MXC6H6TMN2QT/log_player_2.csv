"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum price point. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a good deal while staying within his budget. This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that Bob is serious about buying the product, but needs a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  That's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more for my investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than his maximum budget. There's still room to negotiate a lower price.  Bob has already shown his willingness to compromise, and Alice has rejected his initial offer, so it's likely she's willing to go a bit lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $8,000. This would give us both a fair deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected Alice's offer twice and now it's crucial to show that he is serious about closing the deal. This counteroffer is at Bob's maximum budget, demonstrating his willingness to meet Alice's price but also making it clear that he won't go any higher."
