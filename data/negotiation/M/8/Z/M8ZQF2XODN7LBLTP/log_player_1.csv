Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $1,200,000 for the product. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. While I respect the value you see in the product, my maximum budget remains $1,200,000. I am unable to increase my offer beyond this amount. Could we possibly find a middle ground?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Given our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. This still represents a significant savings for me compared to your initial offer, while acknowledging the value you see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While selling to John would meet the baseline, accepting Bob's offer at $1,400,000 is a significant profit above his initial offer.  Continuing negotiations carries risk, with no guarantee of reaching a better outcome than the current offer on the table."
