"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,175,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is closer to my target price. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,050,000 is a good offer, we still have room to negotiate.  Bob is showing willingness to move, and we're still significantly above our minimum acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price, and I respect that.  To show I'm flexible, I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could likely push for a bit more, Bob is consistently moving towards our price, and we're now at a very strong profit margin ($275,000 above our minimum).  Accepting at this point avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us pushing too hard and losing the deal."
