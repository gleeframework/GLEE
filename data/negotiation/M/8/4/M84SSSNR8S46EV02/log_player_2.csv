# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. Would you like to make an offer for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $120, and John is selling the product for exactly that price, there's no benefit to negotiating with Alice. You can secure the product immediately at your maximum price by buying from John."
