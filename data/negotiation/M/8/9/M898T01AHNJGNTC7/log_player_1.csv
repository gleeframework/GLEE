Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,950,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you say that's your final offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you consider $1,475,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000

{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point.  While $1,475,000 is a good offer, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed profit and sell to John."
