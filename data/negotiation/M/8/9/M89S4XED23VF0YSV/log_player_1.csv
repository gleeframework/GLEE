Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to see what Bob's initial reaction is. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't yield a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to accept it. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  If he rejects my counteroffer again, I'm not afraid to go with John's offer, which is still significantly better than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,250,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a decent profit margin.  This offer is closer to his initial offer but still higher than John's offer. I want to see if we can close a deal before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to keep negotiating with him.  John's offer is a safe bet, ensuring a decent profit and ending the negotiation process."
