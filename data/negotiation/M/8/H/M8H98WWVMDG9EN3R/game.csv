"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to negotiate.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,000. This gives us both a fair price and allows us to close the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
