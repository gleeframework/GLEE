Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you're above your minimum value. 
* **Positive framing:** Using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""valuable"" can make Bob more inclined to consider the offer. 
* **Open-ended question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer, giving you more information about his perceived value. 
* **Prepared for fallback:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $80 gives me a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the initial offer I made. 
* **Opportunity to improve:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially getting a price closer to my initial $100.
* **No immediate need to sell:**  Selling to John guarantees $80, but I have the opportunity to potentially earn more by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. It's still a great price for a product of this quality, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  $90 is a halfway point between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value emphasis:**  Reiterating the product's quality and calling it a ""fair compromise"" strengthens my position. 
* **Open-ended question:**  Asking ""What do you say?"" keeps the conversation open and invites Bob to respond. 
* **Prepared for fallback:**  I'm still aware that John is a fallback option, but I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $85 is only $5 below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I could try to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Bob might not be willing to go higher.  Selling to John guarantees $80, but I'm only $5 away from that.
* **Time constraint:**  Continuing the negotiation might take more time and energy. 

Overall, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option in this situation.  It allows me to close the deal at a price that's close to my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
