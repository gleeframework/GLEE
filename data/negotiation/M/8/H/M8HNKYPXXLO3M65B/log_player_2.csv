"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is below her perceived value, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. Rejecting this offer gives us the opportunity to negotiate a better price, closer to our budget and John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,050,000."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price but still  above the halfway point between our budget and her initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling our serious interest and putting pressure on Alice to move closer to our desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down in price, but her offer is still above John's price. We're getting closer, but it's worth risking another counteroffer to see if we can get below $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm willing to move up a bit in my offer to show my commitment to getting this deal done.  Would you consider $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Concessions:** We're moving closer to John's price, but it's still crucial to demonstrate willingness to negotiate by increasing our offer.  This keeps the negotiation active and avoids appearing inflexible.
* **Target Range:**  Our goal is to land between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000. This counteroffer keeps us in a good position to potentially reach that range in the next round or two.
* **Time Constraint:** We're aware of the 10-round limit, so incrementally increasing our offers ensures we don't run out of rounds before reaching a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to move up. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,150,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has matched John's price.  There's no longer any benefit to negotiating further, as we've reached the best possible outcome. Accepting this offer secures the product at the lowest available price."
