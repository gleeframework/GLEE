Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has finally come down to my maximum budget of $800,000.

Accepting the offer ensures I get the product within my budget and avoid the risk of losing the deal."
