"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This price is still fair considering its value to me, and it leaves some room for negotiation on your side.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm open to further negotiation, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $14,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and gives you a fair profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",15500.0,Alice,5,
