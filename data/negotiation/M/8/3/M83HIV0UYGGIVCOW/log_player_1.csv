Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to your operations. I'm asking for a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's potential for profit above your minimum price.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Offering $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging his potential gain and leaving a safety net with John's offer."
