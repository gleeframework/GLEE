"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm ready to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is your top limit, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
