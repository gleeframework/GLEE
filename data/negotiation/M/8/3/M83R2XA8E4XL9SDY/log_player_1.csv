Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm ready to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
