"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's opening offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to see if a lower price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm ready to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is your top limit, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget. Although Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject the counteroffer, and then Bob might be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's within Bob's budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
