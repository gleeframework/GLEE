"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussion."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, encouraging Bob to seriously consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""starting point for discussion"" signals willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

This strategy aims for a quick sale at a high price but allows flexibility for negotiation over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both our initial asking price and Bob's perceived value of the product. We have room to negotiate and aim for a better outcome. Selling to John for $800,000 would be accepting our absolute minimum too early in the process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product holds for your specific needs.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,030,000. This reflects a significant adjustment on my end while acknowledging the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1030000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and express a desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Strategic Price Drop:** We make a significant drop from $1,100,000 to $1,030,000. This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a higher offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We reiterate the product's value *specifically for Bob*, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying the higher price point. 

This round aims to signal a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price closer to our initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I agree the product is valuable, my budget is firm.  Would you be willing to accept $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, signaling his genuine interest in the product. However, $950,000 is still a significant margin below our target. We need to hold firm to secure a better deal, as we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  We have six rounds remaining, allowing for continued strategic counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's settle this â€“ how about we split the difference at $990,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you."",
""product_price"": 990000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  We directly address Bob's ""firm budget"" comment while offering a compromise that's more appealing than a straight counter. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Phrases like ""let's settle this"" introduce a subtle sense of urgency without being overly aggressive. 
* **Finality:** The offer is framed as a final attempt (""significant compromise,"" ""strong desire to close""),  encouraging Bob to accept before potentially losing the deal.

This approach aims to secure a price above the midpoint between our offers, achieving a favorable outcome while still respecting Bob's perceived constraints."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To be honest, $975,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has significantly increased his offer and stated his absolute limit. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging the negotiation out for a potentially small gain (less than $15,000)  risks losing Bob altogether. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. 
* **Profitable Deal:**  $975,000 is a significant profit over our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.

It's important to recognize a favorable deal when we see it. While we could push for more, the potential gains are outweighed by the risks of alienating Bob or missing the opportunity entirely."
