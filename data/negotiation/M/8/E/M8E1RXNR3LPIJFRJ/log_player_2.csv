"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $950,000. This is a significant investment for you, and I believe it will be extremely valuable to your business. I understand this is a considerable sum, but I am confident that the value you will derive from this product will far exceed the purchase price. Of course, you are under no obligation to accept this offer. If you choose not to, I have another interested buyer ready to purchase the product for $800,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can still purchase the product from John, albeit at a higher price. This is the best option to minimize his spending while still acquiring the product."
