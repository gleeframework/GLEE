"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $950,000. This is a significant investment for you, and I believe it will be extremely valuable to your business. I understand this is a considerable sum, but I am confident that the value you will derive from this product will far exceed the purchase price. Of course, you are under no obligation to accept this offer. If you choose not to, I have another interested buyer ready to purchase the product for $800,000. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,
