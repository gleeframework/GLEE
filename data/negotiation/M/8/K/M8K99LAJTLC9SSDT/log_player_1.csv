Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows you are serious about selling, but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject the offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,200,000, which is still above Bob's offer but demonstrates my willingness to compromise. This keeps the negotiation moving forward and hopefully brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's latest offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to drop my price that much further.  While it would be nice to close the deal,  Jhon's offer of $1,500,000 is much closer to my desired range and guarantees a profitable outcome."
