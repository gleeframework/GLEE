Alice's offer is too high. I can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,200?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

Alice is coming down, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4

 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?"",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to come down to $10,700. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my acceptable range, and it's getting risky to keep pushing for a lower price. Accepting $10,700 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing altogether."
