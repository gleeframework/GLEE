"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a concession, but I'm not willing to go too low. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider coming down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I can offer it to you for $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is already a discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
