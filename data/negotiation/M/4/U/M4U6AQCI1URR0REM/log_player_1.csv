Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with $10,000, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This is a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. This helps build a rapport and encourages him to consider the offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit while still considering the possibility of a counteroffer. By starting at $10,000, I leave room for negotiation but don't undervalue the product. If Bob rejects, I can make a counteroffer closer to my minimum price, or move on to John if the negotiation doesn't seem fruitful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $8500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial value of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to get closer to my desired price. I'll likely counteroffer at a price higher than $8,500, aiming to find a middle ground. If the negotiation doesn't progress favorably, I can always switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to proceed with the sale. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $9,250, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer, but reiterate my need for a higher price. I also emphasize the value of the product to Bob by highlighting that $9,250 is still a good deal for him.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to my target price while keeping the conversation positive and open to compromise. If Bob rejects again, I might consider dropping the price slightly further or switching to John if the negotiations seem unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,800 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, especially considering John is willing to pay my full asking price.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue the negotiation to see if I can get Bob closer to my target price. If not, I'll move to selling the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm still interested in working with you.  However, $8,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,000? This would be a good compromise, and I would be happy to finalize the sale. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm increasing my offer to $9,000, which is only $200 more than Bob's last offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying within my acceptable range.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget but reaffirm my need for a higher price. I also emphasize the ""good compromise"" aspect of my offer, aiming to make it more appealing to Bob.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a subtle push towards my desired price range. It signals that I'm not willing to go much lower, but I'm still open to negotiation. If Bob rejects again, I will likely propose a final offer closer to my minimum, or move to selling the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're still trying to make a profit, but I'm really close to my budget limit. I'm willing to go up to $8900, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,900 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Even though I'm open to negotiation, his offer isn't close enough to my target range, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a favorable outcome.  At this point, it's more advantageous for me to sell the product to John, who is willing to pay my full asking price, ensuring a better profit. 

**Strategy:**

By choosing to sell to John, I secure the maximum possible profit, avoiding further negotiation that might not result in a satisfactory outcome."
