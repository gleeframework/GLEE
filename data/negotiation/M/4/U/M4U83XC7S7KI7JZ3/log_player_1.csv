{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking $110 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $110, which is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still secure a profitable deal.
* **Message:** I'm trying to be friendly and encouraging, highlighting the value of the product to pique Bob's interest. 

I'm starting with a high price because I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me a stronger position in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your generosity, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer with a price closer to my desired price point.  I have the backup option of selling to John for $100, which gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $95.  This is still a fantastic price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $95, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a decent profit.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to remind Bob of its worth and justify my price. I'm also emphasizing that this is a ""compromise"" to encourage him to accept. 

I'm aiming for a price as close to $100 as possible without risking losing the deal completely.  My backup option with John gives me the confidence to hold firm for a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go that low, especially considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $100.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob when I have a better offer already on the table."
