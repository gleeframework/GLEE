"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  Perhaps we can meet in the middle - how about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $13,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is closer to the mark, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000? This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
