"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1000000 to make this work. I'm offering you the product for $1050000. This is a fair price, and it reflects the value I know you'll get from this product. Let's make a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1025000. Can we meet at this price?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
