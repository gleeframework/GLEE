Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a real game changer, and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is way too low. While I could sell to John and secure $1,000,000,  I believe I can get a better price from Bob if I continue negotiating.  Let's see if I can move him closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this work. I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and it reflects the value I know you'll get from this product. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1025000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my desired price point.  While I could continue negotiating and try to get a bit more, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and ending up selling to John for $1,000,000 is too high. It's better to secure a deal now and ensure I get a good profit."
