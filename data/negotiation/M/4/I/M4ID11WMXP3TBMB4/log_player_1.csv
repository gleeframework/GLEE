Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1400000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go as low as $1,400,000.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $1,500,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it still gives you a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1500000. I'm willing to go up to $1450000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still too low, and with only 4 rounds remaining, I don't have enough time to continue negotiating. I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I meet my minimum target."
