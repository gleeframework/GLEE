,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and I accept $1,075,000? This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,060,000 is still a bit too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,090,000.

"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,080,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000.  This is my final offer before I move on to other potential buyers.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. Let's not waste any more time.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
