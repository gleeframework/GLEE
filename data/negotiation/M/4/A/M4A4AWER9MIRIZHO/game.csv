"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!",100.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I know it's worth less than that to you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  While I understand your perspective, $80 simply doesn't cover my costs. Let's split the difference. How about $90? That way we both get a good deal.  What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $90. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm willing to pay that, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  $85 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $95. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $92.50, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can agree on that, I'll make the purchase.",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close, but $92.50 still leaves me a little short.  How about we split the difference again and go with $93.75? It's a small jump, and it gets us to a deal. I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price.  What do you think?",93.75,Alice,7,
