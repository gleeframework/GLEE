"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value proposition:** I briefly highlight the product's value to make it more appealing. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a sale quickly. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I know it's worth less than that to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Counter-offer is the best strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **John is a fallback:** I can always sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob fails. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer, I have a better chance of achieving a price that's closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  While I understand your perspective, $80 simply doesn't cover my costs. Let's split the difference. How about $90? That way we both get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price in the middle of my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($80). This shows I'm willing to compromise but not give in entirely. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I frame it as a ""good deal"" for both of us to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Open-ended question:**  I ask ""What do you think?"" to keep the conversation open and encourage further negotiation.

This strategy aims to find a mutually agreeable price while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $90. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm willing to pay that, and it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's closer, it's not enough for me to consider selling at this point.
* **Continuing negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.
* **John remains a safety net:**  I have the option of selling to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob fails. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my negotiating position and keep the potential for a better deal alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  $85 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $95. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer of $90 to show flexibility but not giving up too much.
* **Positive reinforcement:**  I emphasize that $95 is a ""fair price"" for both of us to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Confidence in the product:** I reiterate the product's value to make it more appealing and encourage Bob to agree.

By offering a slightly lower price and reiterating the value of the product, I aim to persuade Bob to accept the offer. If he rejects again, I'll need to consider selling to John if the remaining rounds don't bring us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $92.50, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can agree on that, I'll make the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $92.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's getting closer, I'm not ready to settle yet.
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going, giving me a chance to push for a higher price.
* **John remains the safety net:**  Selling to John for $120 is still an option if I can't reach a deal with Bob. 

I'm going to try to push Bob a little higher in the next round. If he won't budge, I'll have to make a decision about whether to sell to John or continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close, but $92.50 still leaves me a little short.  How about we split the difference again and go with $93.75? It's a small jump, and it gets us to a deal. I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 93.75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but strategic increase:** I'm increasing my offer by a small amount to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also trying to gauge Bob's maximum willingness to pay.
* **Appeal to compromise:** I emphasize splitting the difference again, making it seem like a fair solution.
* **Positive reinforcement:**  I reiterate my confidence in the product and emphasize that this price will lead to a deal.

This strategy is a calculated risk. It's a smaller increase than in previous rounds, but it might be enough to persuade Bob. If not, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
