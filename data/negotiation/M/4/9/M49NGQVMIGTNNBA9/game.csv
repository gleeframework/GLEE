"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is below its true value. How about we agree on $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is still a little high for my budget. Would you consider $870,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",870000.0,Bob,4,
