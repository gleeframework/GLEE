Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a high price, but one that still allows for potential negotiation. 
* This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for him to counteroffer. 
* It's also lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a potentially better deal. 

By starting high, I aim to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and potentially secure a better price than the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:** I can propose a price closer to my desired value, potentially securing a higher price.
* **Test the waters:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and that I value the product. This might make him reconsider and offer a better price.

I believe that continuing the negotiation offers a better chance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, potentially securing a higher price than selling to John right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm lowering my price from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* However, $1,350,000 is still higher than Bob's last offer and within a reasonable range for both of us. 
* This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to compromise but am not desperate to sell at a significantly lower price. 

I hope this counteroffer encourages Bob to consider a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, leading us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough decision, but I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,500,000. 

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,150,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction.
* **Negotiation risk:**  It's possible that Bob will continue to lower his offers, potentially leading to a prolonged negotiation with no guarantee of a satisfactory price. 
* **Guaranteed income:** Selling to John ensures a quick and secure sale at my desired price.

While I'd like to get closer to the initial $1,400,000 I offered, the risk of further negotiation with Bob is not worth the potential for a lower price. Selling to John guarantees a strong profit and provides a stable outcome."
