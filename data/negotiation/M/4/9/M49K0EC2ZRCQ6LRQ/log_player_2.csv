"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and leaves little room for negotiation. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the potential value to me, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,300,000 is a strong offer, I'm confident it's worth closer to my initial price. To meet you halfway, I propose $1,350,000. This reflects the product's significant potential for your specific needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is within your budget and a good compromise.  While you might be able to negotiate further, the risk of going back and forth with Alice could lead to her raising the price again, or you might have to resort to buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer secures the product within your budget."
