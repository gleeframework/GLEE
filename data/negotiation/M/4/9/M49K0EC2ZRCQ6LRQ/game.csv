"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the potential value to me, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,300,000 is a strong offer, I'm confident it's worth closer to my initial price. To meet you halfway, I propose $1,350,000. This reflects the product's significant potential for your specific needs.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
