"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about we start at $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate but also demonstrating he's serious about buying the product. The $9,000 price is still within Bob's budget, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than his initial counteroffer.  Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming to get closer to his target price of $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,000.  I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his initial offer of $9,000.  He's now proposing a price that's halfway between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is only $500 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  This is a good compromise, especially since there are only 5 rounds left.  Accepting the offer ensures that Bob gets the product at a reasonable price, and there's not much more room for negotiation."
