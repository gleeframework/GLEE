"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high ($1,700,000) compared to your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's also significantly higher than what you would pay John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to pay and still get a good deal.  It's also the price I can get from John, so if Alice rejects this, I'll just buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget. I can still get the product for a lower price from John. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice, but if she doesn't come down to $1,200,000 or less, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,300,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but still keeps the price below her last offer. It's a compromise that might convince her to sell while still staying within my preferred price range. If she rejects, I'll go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I've already made a counteroffer that was rejected, and it's clear Alice is not willing to come down to my desired price point.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,200,000 and avoid further negotiation."
