"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I'm a bit surprised you're still trying to negotiate at this point, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free warranty and some additional support services. The price remains at $14500. This is my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate the extras you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've decided to walk away from the deal and explore other options. I'm willing to walk away from the deal and buy the product from John for $10000. I hope you understand my decision.",10000.0,Bob,10,
