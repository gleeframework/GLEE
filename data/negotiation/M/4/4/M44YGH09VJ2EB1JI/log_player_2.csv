"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, we're extending this exclusive offer at a price of $110. We hope this aligns well with your budget and needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still a bit too high. It's time to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $110 is a bit outside my budget. Could you do it for $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, aiming to create room for negotiation. 
* **Expressing Interest:** The message emphasizes interest in the product while clearly stating the price is the main obstacle.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  Offering $90 leaves a gap for Alice to counter and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 

The goal is to get the product for a price significantly closer to John's offer ($100) without losing the opportunity to negotiate with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. After careful consideration, I'm glad to present an alternative offer at $95 for our product. This price reflects the value we place on customer satisfaction while remaining competitive within the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice coming down to $95 is a good deal. It's a significant discount from her initial offer and only $5 more than John's price. Continuing to negotiate for a smaller difference might risk losing the deal altogether."
