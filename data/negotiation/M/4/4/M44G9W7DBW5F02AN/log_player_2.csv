"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than her initial asking price, it's still above his maximum budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, he's already very close to his maximum budget. At this point, it's likely that Alice won't go any lower, and risking further negotiations could lead to her rejecting his counteroffer and him having to buy from John at a higher price."
