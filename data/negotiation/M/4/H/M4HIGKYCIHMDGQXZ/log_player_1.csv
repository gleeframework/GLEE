Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me ($150).  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low price yet. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product!  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? That's still a fair price considering the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum ($150), it's still below it.  I'm willing to give him one more chance to meet my price, but if he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm ready to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $135? This is a great price for the product, and it's the best I can offer."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I've reached the point where I'm getting frustrated with the negotiation.  Bob is refusing to come up much in his offers, and I'm only two rounds away from my ""walk away"" point.  At this point, it's clear he's not going to meet my minimum. I'm better off selling to John and getting my guaranteed $150."
