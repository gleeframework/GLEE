"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a high price ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so this gives me a decent buffer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the uniqueness and value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Potential:** Bob's offer is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This indicates he's genuinely interested and there's room for further negotiation.
* **Early Stage:** We are only in the second round. It's too early to accept an offer that's still a good distance from my initial asking price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** By rejecting the offer, I can counter with a higher price and potentially secure a better deal.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 for this unique product. It's still a great deal for you, and we can finalize this transaction today."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price point closer to my initial offer.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the ""today"" aspect to create a sense of urgency and potentially motivate Bob to accept.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the unique value proposition of the product to reinforce its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1700000 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me in the middle at $1750000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  There's still room for negotiation and potential to get a better price.
* **Midpoint Compromise:**  Bob's suggestion of a midpoint compromise is a tactic. While it seems fair, it doesn't necessarily reflect the actual value of the product.
* **Remaining Rounds:** We are still in the early rounds (4th round). I have time to explore more options and see if I can secure a price closer to my desired range.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,750,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this unique product. I'm willing to consider $1,800,000 as a final compromise.  It's a great deal for you, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's last offer, signaling I'm willing to negotiate but not significantly lowering my stance.
* **Final Compromise:** I'm positioning this as a final compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Urgency:**  I'm re-emphasizing the ""quickly"" aspect to create a sense of urgency and encourage a faster decision.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still trying to maximize the selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1650000 is a fair price for this product. Can you consider meeting me at $1700000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  However, I still have some room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Midpoint Compromise:**  Again, Bob's suggestion of a midpoint compromise is a tactic. I'm not obligated to accept a midpoint just because it seems fair.
* **Remaining Rounds:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic. I still have time to explore options and potentially secure a better price.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,675,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow us to finalize this transaction quickly."", ""product_price"": 1675000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a midpoint between Bob's latest offer ($1,700,000) and my previous offer ($1,650,000).  It shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a decent price.
* **Urgency:**  I'm re-emphasizing the ""quickly"" aspect to encourage a fast decision and avoid potential delays.
* **Fair Deal:**  I'm framing this as a fair deal for both parties to make it more appealing to Bob.

By offering a midpoint, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept the offer and finalize the deal without further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1650000. Can we finalize the deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Given the remaining rounds and potential for further negotiation, accepting this offer seems like the best strategy.
* **Limited Upside:** There's limited room for negotiation at this point.  Further rounds might not yield a significantly higher price.
* **Time Factor:** With only 2 rounds remaining, accepting the offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether.

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer of $1,650,000 to secure the sale and maximize my earnings."
