{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we still have room to negotiate, Bob has shown a willingness to move upwards in his offers. Accepting at $1,150,000 secures a substantial profit ($350,000 above our minimum) and avoids the risk of pushing Bob too far and losing the deal entirely.  It's always possible to get a slightly better deal, but this is a strong offer worth accepting."
