"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,100,000 is still significantly above his budget of $800,000.  It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, dropping the price to $850,000. This is a strong initial move that demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate but also sets a clear boundary based on his budget. It's likely Alice will counter, but this gives Bob a good starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. There's room for negotiation, and since Bob has more rounds to work with, rejecting the offer and continuing to counteroffer might lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's previous counteroffer of $850,000 was rejected, indicating Alice is willing to negotiate but wants a price closer to $950,000. This counteroffer of $900,000 is a compromise, showing Bob's willingness to meet halfway while still staying within his budget.  This move gives Bob a better chance of closing the deal while still saving a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $975,000 is still above Bob's budget and a bit too close to his limit.  With several rounds left, it's worth rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate.  There's a chance Alice might lower the price further, or Bob might be able to secure a better deal with a counteroffer.  There's also always the option to purchase from John if the negotiations with Alice don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of offering a middle ground.  $925,000 represents a further compromise from his previous offer of $900,000,  but it still keeps a significant buffer between his offer and Alice's most recent price of $975,000. This shows Alice that Bob is willing to negotiate but is firm on his financial limit.  The hope is that this offer will be enticing enough for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing she's not willing to go lower than $990,000.  Bob has only 3 rounds left, and the offers are getting closer to his limit.  Considering the risk of further negotiation and the limited time, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase from John at a fixed price of $800,000. This guarantees him the product within his budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Alice."
