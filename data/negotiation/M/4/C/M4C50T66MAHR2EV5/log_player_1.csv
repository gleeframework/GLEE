Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point:** It's a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately alienating Bob.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. It also invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer. You'll need to be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response and the potential for a counteroffer. Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit while also considering the possibility of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting it would result in a large financial loss. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's still potential for a deal.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired range.

**Next Steps:** You should send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that is higher than $8,000 but lower than your original offer of $12,000.  This will give Bob the opportunity to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,000?  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:**  $10,000 is a compromise between your previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000.  It's a price that is closer to your desired range while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** The message emphasizes compromise and fairness, suggesting that you are open to finding a mutually beneficial solution.

**Next Steps:**  You should wait for Bob's response to your counteroffer. He might accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.  You should be prepared to negotiate further or to walk away from the deal if you feel you cannot reach a mutually agreeable price."
