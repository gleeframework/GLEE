"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for significantly less than $12,000.  It's worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price of $12,000, while still leaving room for negotiation.  It's also well below your maximum price of $15,000, ensuring a good deal for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. There's still room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's current offer of $10,000. It's a reasonable middle ground that shows you're serious about buying the product while still trying to get a good deal."
