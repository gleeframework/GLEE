"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you!  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is more than your minimum but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It also highlights the value Bob gets from the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $90 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's counteroffer of $90 is still a good deal for me, exceeding my minimum of $80.  It's better to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiations that could result in a lower price or a failed deal."
