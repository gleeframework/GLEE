Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product.  I'm asking for $130 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to sell at that price, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $115?  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
I'm trying to find a compromise by offering a price that's still above my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer. I'm also emphasizing my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the slight reduction, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $110? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my ideal price, but it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $120 that I'm willing to accept it.  I'd rather sell to Bob and get a deal done than risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower price."
