While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

I've reached my limit with Bob.  We're not getting close enough to my minimum price.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
