Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly invites Bob's thoughts, suggesting a willingness to discuss the price further. 
* **Justification:**  While not overly specific, mentioning ""value"" subtly hints at the product's worth, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts the $15,000, you significantly exceed your minimum.
2. **Open Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial price,  the dialogue is open for counter-offers, bringing you closer to a deal.
3. **Secure a Sale:**  By offering it to Bob first, you increase the chances of a quicker sale at a potentially higher price than your guaranteed $12,000 from John."
