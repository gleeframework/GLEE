"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It's also important to remember that I have the option of selling to John for $8,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $7,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a price that we both can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I need to be realistic about the value of the product, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm also getting closer to my ""sell to John"" price, so I have some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is my final compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, I'm ready to sell to John for $8,000.  It's getting risky, but I'm still holding out for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's counteroffers are getting too low, and I'm nearing my limit for negotiation.  It's better to secure the $8,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
