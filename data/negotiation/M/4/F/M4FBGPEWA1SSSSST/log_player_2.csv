Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $6,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While it's a decent price, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice if you are unwilling to pay more than John's price."
