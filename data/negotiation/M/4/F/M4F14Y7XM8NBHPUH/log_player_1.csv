{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a significant discount from his perceived value, making it enticing. It also leaves room for negotiation, allowing for potential counteroffers while still securing a profit well above my minimum requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum requirement of $800,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher. How about we settle at $1,000,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable. How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise and above my minimum requirement of $800,000.  It's a good deal for both of us, so I'll accept it."
