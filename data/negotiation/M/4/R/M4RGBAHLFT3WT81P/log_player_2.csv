Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm counteroffering at $975,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she's not budging significantly from her last offer of $975,000. This is still considerably higher than John's offer of $800,000.  At this point, continuing the negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price I'm willing to pay. Buying from John ensures I get the product at the best possible price."
