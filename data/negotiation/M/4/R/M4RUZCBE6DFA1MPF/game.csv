"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. Let's see if we can make this work!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? I think that's a fair price considering the value you'll receive from this product. Let me know what you think!",10750.0,Alice,5,
