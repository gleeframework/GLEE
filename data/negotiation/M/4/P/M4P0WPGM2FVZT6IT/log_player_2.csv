"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $15,000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is more than his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,500 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $12,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if he can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice has come down to $13,000, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay, and he doesn't want to risk going through more negotiation rounds.  John is offering the product at Bob's ideal price, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
