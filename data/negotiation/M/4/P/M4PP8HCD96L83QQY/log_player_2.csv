"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept the first offer. There's a chance Alice might be willing to sell for less, and negotiating gives you the opportunity to potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $100 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  It leaves room for potential compromise and allows us to gauge Alice's willingness to sell at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to my limit, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to drop her price a bit more, especially since she's already rejected a lower offer. I'm confident I can get a better deal with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $110. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying below my maximum limit. It's also a reasonable counter to Alice's offer of $115, showing that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $112 is getting close to my limit, I'm still not ready to accept. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still room for a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 111}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $111. This is a small increment but signals my willingness to meet Alice halfway. Since my maximum is $120, I believe this is the last reasonable offer I can make while still getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $109 is below my maximum of $120 and represents a significant saving compared to my initial limit. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further or that I could lose the deal entirely. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the potential for further negotiation delays."
