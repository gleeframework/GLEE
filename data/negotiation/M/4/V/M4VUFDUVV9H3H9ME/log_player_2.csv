"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I know it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $18,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $15,000 for it. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering his maximum price, which is his target price. This sets a clear boundary and signals his serious intent to buy the product if the price is right."
