"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving Room:** While the product is worth $12,000 to you, starting at $16,000 gives you space to potentially make concessions and still reach a very profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Bob's Response:**  This first offer will give you insight into how badly Bob wants the product. His reaction will help you determine your strategy for subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. He started at $12,000, which indicates he might be willing to go a bit higher. Rejecting his offer keeps the door open for a potentially more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, the product's value is quite a bit higher than that for me. Could you do $14,500?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's higher value ""for me,"" you subtly remind Bob that your valuation is different and there's a reason behind your pricing. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will reveal more about Bob's price sensitivity and how much further he might be willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product has value to you, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is a significant profit above your minimum of $12,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or be less willing to negotiate further.
* **Time Value:** Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the uncertainty of further rounds. You can use the time saved to pursue other opportunities."
