"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm offering it to you for $125.  It's a fair price, considering it's worth more to you than to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
