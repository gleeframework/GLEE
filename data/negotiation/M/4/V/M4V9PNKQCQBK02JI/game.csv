"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I believe this is the best compromise we can reach, considering the product's value and your budget.",850000.0,Alice,5,
