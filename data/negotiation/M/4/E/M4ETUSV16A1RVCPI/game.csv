"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with another seller.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your offer, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
