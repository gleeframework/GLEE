Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is way over his budget.  He should counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down closer to his $8,000 limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with!

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his limit.  He should try to negotiate further and see if Alice will go lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,000, so I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with!

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice has come down in price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  John's offer is the best option for Bob to get the product within his price range."
