{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than the product's value to Bob, leaving room for compromise.  It also signals a willingness to negotiate, which could encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $145. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a loss on it. I'll counteroffer to try and find a price we both can agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $145 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $155. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $155 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150 and is close enough to my initial asking price that I'm willing to accept it. It's better than selling to John for $150, and continuing to negotiate could lead to further concessions that might push the price down even further."
