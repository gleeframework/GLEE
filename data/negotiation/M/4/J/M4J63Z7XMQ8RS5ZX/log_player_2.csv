"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, and I'm confident you'll see its potential.  I'm willing to let it go for a very competitive price. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the $1,000,000 you're willing to pay.  Since you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, it's more beneficial to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
