"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product for a price that I think is very reasonable, considering its value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the value you placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1050000, but that's still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $950000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, as I'm not comfortable going any higher.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1000000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
