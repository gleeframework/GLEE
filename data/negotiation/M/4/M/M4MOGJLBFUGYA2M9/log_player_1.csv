**Reasoning:**  Bob is steadily increasing his offer, and we are now above my minimum acceptable price while still significantly above his perceived value. Accepting this offer secures a good profit. It's not worth the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling out in the remaining rounds."
