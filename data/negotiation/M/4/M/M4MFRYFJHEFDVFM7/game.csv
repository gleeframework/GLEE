"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a steal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let's see if we can work something out.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1,200,000 for the product. I think it's a bit pricey, and I'd like to see if we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This price still offers you a great value for the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,450,000.  This price reflects the value I've placed on the product while still allowing you to benefit from the investment.  Let's get this deal done.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
