"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see significant value in it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is lower than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than what you could buy it from John for.  There's room for negotiation, and by rejecting this initial offer, you might prompt Alice to come down to a more reasonable price."
