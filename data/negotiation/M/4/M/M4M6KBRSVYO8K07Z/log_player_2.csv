"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. While this is a significant investment, I'm confident the product's potential will exceed your expectations. If this doesn't work for you, I have another buyer lined up, but I would prefer to work with you if possible. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While she suggests the product's value exceeds expectations, you don't have enough information to assess that. It's better to reject the offer and buy from John for a guaranteed price within your budget."
