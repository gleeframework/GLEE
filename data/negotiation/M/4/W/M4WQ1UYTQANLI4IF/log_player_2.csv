"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product, and I think you'll really appreciate its features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get the product for less than $11,000 since Alice is willing to sell it for $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11250. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Alice is coming down slightly, but $11,250 is still more than you'd like to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you are still closer to your goal of getting it for $10,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $11000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still slightly higher than your ideal price, but it's closer to your goal of saving money than buying from John. 

Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **You've already negotiated:**  You've demonstrated your willingness to compromise, and Alice is willing to meet you halfway.
* **It's not worth risking a deal:** Continuing to negotiate might result in Alice walking away or becoming unwilling to negotiate further.
* **Saving $1000:** You'll still be saving $1000 compared to buying from John."
