"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be worth $1,200,000 to me at most. How about we start around there? Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your initial offer of $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its overall worth to me. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the product's value to you and its worth to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
