,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $75?  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? That seems fair, wouldn't you say? ",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $80, which is the price John is selling it for.  Let's make a deal at that price and avoid any further negotiations.",80.0,Bob,4,
