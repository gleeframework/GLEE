"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's split the difference and make this happen.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85, which would be $77.50. Can you consider that?",77.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $77.50 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you at $82.50. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you say?",82.5,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $79. Would you be willing to consider that?",79.0,Bob,6,
