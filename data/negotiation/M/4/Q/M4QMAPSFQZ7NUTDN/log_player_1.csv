Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate down slightly.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling for anything above $12,000 is a win since you have a guaranteed buyer in John."
