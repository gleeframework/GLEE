Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
