Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe this gives me the best chance of earning a high price while still leaving room for Bob to potentially counteroffer.  I'll be closely watching Bob's response and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it for now and see if I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise.  I believe this price is fair, but I'll be ready to adjust depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit for me.  I'm starting to feel like Bob might be willing to pay closer to my minimum price, but I don't want to risk him walking away completely. I'll take the $1,100,000."
