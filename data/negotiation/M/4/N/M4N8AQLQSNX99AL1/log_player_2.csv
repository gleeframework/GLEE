"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price of $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  This is a limited time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still over Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within his budget."
