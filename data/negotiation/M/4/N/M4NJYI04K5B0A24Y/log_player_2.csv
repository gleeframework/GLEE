"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. My asking price is $14,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is less than what John is asking, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $14,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he's offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a good starting point for negotiation.  It's still above what the product is worth to Alice, giving her room to negotiate, but significantly lower than the $15,000 he could pay John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. While Alice has lowered her price, $14,000 is still above what Bob is willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's offering a price that's closer to Alice's latest offer, showing his willingness to compromise. This could potentially lead to a quick deal."
