"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm happy to pay $13500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $13,500, I believe I can get closer to my goal of $14,000. There are still 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,750. It's still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 13750}
