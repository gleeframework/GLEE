"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $10,000. Would you be able to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum price.  I'd like to see if I can get closer to my target price before selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still hoping to stay within my budget of $10,000. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can achieve a higher price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but if the next few rounds don't bring us closer, I will sell the product to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise.  This price reflects the value of the product and also allows you to stay within a reasonable budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your patience, Alice. I'm still aiming to keep my spending under $10,000. Could we possibly reach an agreement closer to that figure? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $10,250 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll keep negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds, but I'm getting closer to selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about my minimum price. While I want to work with you, I can't go lower than $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows me to cover my costs and still provides you with a good deal.  Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your understanding. I'm really hoping to stick to my budget of $10,000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are in round 8, which means we only have 2 rounds left to close the deal with Bob. Although Bob has offered $10,500, which is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. With only two rounds left, the risk of not getting a better price is high. It's better to sell to John at $15,000 and secure a more profitable deal."
