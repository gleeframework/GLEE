"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I'm confident it could be worth even more to someone with the right vision. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a price point I believe reflects its true potential, while still being attractive for a deal. Let's discuss further if you're interested.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
