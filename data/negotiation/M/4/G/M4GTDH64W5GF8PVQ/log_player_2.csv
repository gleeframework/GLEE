Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $1,280,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly willing to move on price, and this offer is a good balance between saving money and getting the deal done. Waiting longer increases the risk that Alice won't budge much further, and we'd be stuck buying from John at full price."
