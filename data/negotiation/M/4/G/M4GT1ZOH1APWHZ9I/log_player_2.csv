You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price from John ($1,500,000) than what Alice is offering ($1,400,000).  Even though it's not the ideal price, it's still better than Alice's offer."
