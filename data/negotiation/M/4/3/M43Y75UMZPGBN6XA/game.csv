"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise for me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",875000.0,Alice,3,
