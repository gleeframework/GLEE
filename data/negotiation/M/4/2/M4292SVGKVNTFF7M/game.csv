"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $95 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I've decided to counter with a price of $90 for the product. This still reflects the value we place on it, while being more accessible to you. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to come to an agreement.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",85.0,Bob,4,

"After careful consideration, I understand your position, Bob. I am willing to meet you halfway at $87.50 for the product. This reflects a compromise between our respective positions and I believe it's a fair offer for both parties. I hope you find this acceptable.",87.5,Alice,5,
