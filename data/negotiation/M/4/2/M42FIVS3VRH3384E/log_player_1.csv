Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1400000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1250000 for it.  This reflects a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make the purchase and you to still make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
