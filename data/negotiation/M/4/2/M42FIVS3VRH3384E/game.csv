"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1400000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1250000 for it.  This reflects a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make the purchase and you to still make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget, $1250000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirement.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This compromise ensures a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1350000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm happy to offer $1300000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
