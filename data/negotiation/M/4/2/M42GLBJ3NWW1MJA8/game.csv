"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a fair price given its value and potential.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer was way too high.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't afford that price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $850,000 is a decent starting point, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,700,000. This leaves room for profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,700,000 is still way out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair offer considering the value of the product and my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply not feasible for me.  To make this deal work, I need to be closer to my minimum.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,400,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $1,200,000 for the product. This is a significant step closer to your minimum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing discussions. Let's find a way to make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $1,200,000 is getting closer, but still not quite there. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000. This offer is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's work towards a final agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're making progress.  $1,300,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not there yet.  My final offer is $1,100,000.  If you're willing to accept this, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
