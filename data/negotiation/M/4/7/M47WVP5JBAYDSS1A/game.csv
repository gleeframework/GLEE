"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on this product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $15000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $16000?",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm glad we're getting closer.  While $16000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a bit more. Let's split the difference and go with $18000.  This would still be a significant savings for you, and it would allow me to make sure I get a fair price for this unique product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
