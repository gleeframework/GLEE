"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $82.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $80? That's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a good offer, but I was really hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. How about we meet at $81? It's still a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",81.0,Alice,5,
