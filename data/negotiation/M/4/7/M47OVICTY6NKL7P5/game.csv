"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $17,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15,500? This reflects the value of the product while still being a fair price for you. Let me know your thoughts.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $15,500 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $13,000. Would you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $13,000 is still too far below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,250.  This gives us both a good deal and lets me avoid selling to John at a lower price.  What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I can see you're motivated to sell, and I am ready to buy.  How about we settle this right now at $13,750?",13750.0,Bob,6,
