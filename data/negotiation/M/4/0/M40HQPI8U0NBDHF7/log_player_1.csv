Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offers are getting too low.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's more acceptable to me."
