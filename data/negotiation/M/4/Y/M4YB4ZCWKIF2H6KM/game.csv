"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest,  $1,600,000 doesn't quite cover my desired return. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our shared desire to make this deal happen.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I still believe that $1,600,000 is a fair price for the product. I would like to stick to that figure. I hope we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
