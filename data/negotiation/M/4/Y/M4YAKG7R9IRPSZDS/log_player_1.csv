{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer:

* **Starts high:**  $950,000 is close to my ideal price but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Is polite and professional:**  This builds trust and makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Sets the stage for negotiation:**  By leaving room for compromise, I invite Bob to counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to respond strategically. 
* **Has a backup plan:**  I know I can always sell to John for $800,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation so far. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price by countering.  Here's why:

* **Bob's value:**  I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, so he has room to pay more.
* **My value:** I won't settle for less than $800,000, but I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $950,000.
* **Control:** By rejecting and countering, I keep control of the negotiation and can potentially drive the price higher. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price somewhere between $850,000 and $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, I'm still not able to go as low as $850,000.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This offer recognizes the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive messaging:**  I emphasize the product's value and mutual benefit, aiming to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Maintain control:**  By offering a counteroffer, I keep control and don't allow Bob to dictate the terms.
* **Pressure:** I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept, as he's already shown his willingness to pay more than $850,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $880000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation so far. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $880,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Close to my floor:**  I'm only giving up $80,000 from my ideal price, and this is a significant amount of money.
* **Further negotiation is risky:** Continuing to negotiate could result in a lower price or a stalemate, which could force me to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Time is money. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and move on to other opportunities.

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most financially responsible decision at this point."
