"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,200,000, but I believe that's the lowest I can go. I'm confident that the product's value to you is higher than that.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value to me while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is sufficient. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal with you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work. I believe this price is fair given the value of the product to me, while still allowing me to stay within my financial limitations.  Let's work together to reach a final agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,075,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe this price is the minimum I can accept to make this deal worthwhile. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
