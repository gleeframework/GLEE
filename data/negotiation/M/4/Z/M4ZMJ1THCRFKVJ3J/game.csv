"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this unique product. It's worth a fortune, and I believe it will be an invaluable asset for you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.  This is a fantastic deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is a decent price, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,050,000.  This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
