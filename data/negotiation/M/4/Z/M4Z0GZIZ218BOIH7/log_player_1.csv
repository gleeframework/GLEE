Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,000 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value.  I'll see if I can get him to budge in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is tempting, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
