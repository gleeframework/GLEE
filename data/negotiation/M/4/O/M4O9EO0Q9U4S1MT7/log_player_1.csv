Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **High but not too high:** $950,000 is significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Concise and confident:** The message is clear and positive, indicating I'm confident in the product's value. 

This allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  There's a good chance Bob will accept, given his value for the product.
* **Maintain bargaining power:**  If Bob rejects, I can counter with a slightly lower price, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable deal.
* **Secure my minimum:** If negotiations fail, I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $800,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. Bob's initial offer is too low.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $900,000 for this product. It's a fair compromise given the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Rejects Bob's offer:**  I'm firm on not settling for his initial price.
* **Compromises but maintains value:** $900,000 is halfway between my initial offer and his. 
* **Highlights the value:**  I emphasize the product's value to Bob to justify my stance.

This strategy aims to:

* **Push for a higher price:**  By meeting him halfway, I signal flexibility, but not a willingness to cave.
* **Keep negotiations alive:**  A counteroffer keeps the dialogue open for a potential win-win.
* **Set a clear bottom line:** $900,000 is my new minimum; any lower and I might sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to counter your offer by suggesting $850,000 as a potential price for the product. This is my best offer within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is still below my initial target, it's a significant improvement over Bob's initial offer.  At this point,  negotiating further risks losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale above my minimum, and it's close enough to my initial offer to be considered a success."
