"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $9,500 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,800. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,800 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Rejecting the offer and counteroffering again gives Bob a chance to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still only able to go up to $8,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still looking to make a decent profit on this product. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $8,400. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,400 is within Bob's budget and is a significant improvement from her previous offer. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible or that the negotiation will drag on.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price without risking further delays or potentially losing out on the deal altogether."
