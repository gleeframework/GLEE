"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider a significantly lower price, closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  To be honest, I've got a budget of $8,000 max.  If you can do something closer to that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $8,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet at least $12,000 to make it worth my while. Can we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,000 is closer, but still a stretch.  How about we split the difference and say $10,000? That would be my absolute best offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already met you halfway and offered $12,000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm afraid my next offer will be my final one. How about we meet at $13,000? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",13000.0,Alice,7,
