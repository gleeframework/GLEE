"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we start at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows me a fair profit while giving you a great deal. Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a touch higher than I'd like.  Would you consider $760,000?  That would make this purchase more palatable for me.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal quickly. I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase.",800000.0,Alice,5,
