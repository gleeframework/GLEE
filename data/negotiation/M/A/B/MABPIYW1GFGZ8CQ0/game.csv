"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1200000 is significantly below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and reflects your interest in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
