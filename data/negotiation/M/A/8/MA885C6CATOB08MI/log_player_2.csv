Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price is still fair considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to move closer to this offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000 as a compromise. This is a fair price considering the value the product offers, and it's a significant step towards closing this deal.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,162,500.  This is a significant step towards closing the deal, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,162,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,162,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is offering the product for $1,162,500.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, the difference is becoming smaller and there's a risk Alice might not budge much more. Accepting this offer guarantees a saving compared to John's price and avoids the risk of a stalemate."
