Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 180} 

Here's the reasoning behind this approach:

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Anchoring:**  By offering a higher price initially, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he doesn't accept the first offer, his counteroffer might be higher than if you had started lower.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $180 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a deal, while still keeping you significantly above your minimum price.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I've seen similar products in the market for that price, and I'm not sure if I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, even if it means walking away from the table for now. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $120 is significantly below the product's actual value. I'm willing to come down to $165, but that's my best offer."", ""product_price"": 165}

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):**  This counteroffer meets Bob a bit closer to the middle ground between his initial offer and my initial asking price. 
* **Firm but Fair:** The tone remains polite and professional, but I'm also communicating that I'm serious about my valuation of the product.
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Power:** By offering $165, I'm still leaving myself room to accept John's offer if Bob doesn't budge significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $130. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $137.50, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While not ideal, $137.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, and Bob seems firm on his final offer. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers."
