Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is midway between your minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000). It leaves room for negotiation while still giving you a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it is still below the mid-point of our negotiation range. We have the chance to push for a slightly better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a little lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,500? It's still a great deal for you, and we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 9500}
