"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. It's a good deal, but he can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a little lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,500? It's still a great deal for you, and we can close this quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice has come down to $9,500, which is a good deal for Bob.  At this point, it's worth it for Bob to accept the offer and avoid the risk of a further negotiation with Alice or having to buy from John at a higher price."
