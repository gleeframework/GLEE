"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, it makes more sense to buy from John immediately. This avoids the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially driving up the price."
