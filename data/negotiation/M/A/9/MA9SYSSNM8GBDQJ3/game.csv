"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a huge asset to your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which leaves significant room for both of us to benefit.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, I believe $1,200,000 is a bit high.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is still a little too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $1,050,000.  Would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. However, $1,025,000 is still below my minimum price point. I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise and ensures a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's close this deal.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I can move a bit on my end.  Would you be willing to accept $1,050,000 to finalize the deal?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm close to my bottom line, but I can accept $1,060,000. This price gives us both a good deal.  Let's finalize this transaction.",1060000.0,Alice,7,
