"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair price.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $900,000.  This still leaves you room for profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $700,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet halfway at $850,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away happy and with a good deal. Let's make it happen!",850000.0,Alice,5,
