"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" I'm aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level.
* **Leaving Room:** This offer is significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value, allowing for concessions throughout the negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's seriousness:** A very low counter-offer might indicate he's not a serious buyer.
2. **Establish a strong position:** Starting high gives me more bargaining power. 
3. **Potentially secure a great deal:** There's always a chance Bob accepts the initial offer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, it's higher than I can currently afford.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is expectedly at his perceived value, which is significantly below my minimum. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is always an option, I still have ample rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product extends far beyond the $1,000,000 mark. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While I rejected Bob's offer, I'm making a significant concession from my initial price to show willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm reiterating the product's inherent value, aiming to shift Bob's focus away from his perceived limit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer helps gauge Bob's flexibility and sets the stage for further negotiation. 

I'm hoping this offer encourages Bob to engage more seriously while staying comfortably above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price reflects the value I see in the product, while also staying within my budget.  Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which shows he's interested. However, $1,100,000 is still too low and significantly below my $1,200,000 minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more movement from Bob's side.  I'll aim for a counter-offer that encourages him to make a more substantial jump."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible agreement. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counter-offer splits the difference between Bob's latest offer ($1,100,000) and my previous asking price ($1,400,000). It represents a fair compromise at this stage.
* **Firm but Fair:** By emphasizing my ""considerable compromise,"" I'm subtly communicating that this is a strong offer. I want Bob to understand that major concessions from my side are becoming less likely.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  Offering a clear and reasonable compromise keeps the negotiation moving forward and encourages Bob to respond in kind. 

I'm aiming to strike a balance between securing a favorable price and avoiding a stalemate. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which demonstrates my commitment to this deal.  Let's find common ground and make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unfortunately stuck in a pattern of small increments. While he's moving in the right direction, his latest offer of $1,150,000 is still significantly below my $1,200,000 minimum. 

At this point:

* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him not reaching my minimum within the remaining rounds. I'd be losing valuable time I could be using to finalize the sale with John.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer represents a guaranteed $1,200,000, which meets my needs and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Setting a Precedent:** While I believe Bob might eventually reach my minimum, accepting a significantly lower offer could set a precedent for future negotiations.

Therefore, the most rational decision is to secure the guaranteed and acceptable offer from John."
