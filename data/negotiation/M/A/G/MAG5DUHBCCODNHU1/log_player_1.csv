# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.
