"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item that you value at $150, at a reasonable price. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can likely do better.  You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $100. Our current asking price is based on the value we believe the product holds. I would like to propose $110 as a compromise. This still allows us to achieve a fair profit while offering you a significant discount compared to its perceived value. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $110 is a good compromise. It's still a decent discount from your perceived value of $150, and it's higher than your counteroffer of $100. Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product at a favorable price while avoiding the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a higher price or the need to buy from John."
