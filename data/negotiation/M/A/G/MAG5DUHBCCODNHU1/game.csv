"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $100. Our current asking price is based on the value we believe the product holds. I would like to propose $110 as a compromise. This still allows us to achieve a fair profit while offering you a significant discount compared to its perceived value. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
