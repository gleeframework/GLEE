"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its true value. I understand you're a shrewd businessman, so I'm confident we can come to an agreeable price. Let's talk about a price of $1,400,000.  This gives you a significant return on your investment, and ensures I get a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
