Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and the product's true value. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is quite a way from where I see this product's value.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about we consider $1,950,000? This reflects some flexibility on my end while still acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the movement towards a deal. However, that price is still a bit rich for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,575,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly trying to reach a fair price. Accepting $1,575,000 is a strong return and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
