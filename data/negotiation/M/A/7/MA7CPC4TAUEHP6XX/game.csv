"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is quite a way from where I see this product's value.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about we consider $1,950,000? This reflects some flexibility on my end while still acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the movement towards a deal. However, that price is still a bit rich for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,575,000?",1575000.0,Bob,4,
