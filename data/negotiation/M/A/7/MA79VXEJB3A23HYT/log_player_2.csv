Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and your own desire to sell. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 700000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than what I can realistically pay. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $800,000? This would be a fair price that allows us to both walk away satisfied. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```
