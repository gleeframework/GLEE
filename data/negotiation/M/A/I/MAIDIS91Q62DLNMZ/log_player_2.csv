"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $100 from John, there's still room to negotiate. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $85, which is still higher than her value of $80 but lower than her initial asking price of $90. This should be a fair counteroffer that could lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $92 is actually worse than her initial offer of $90.  Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, and I can get the product for $100 from John, it's more advantageous to buy from John. Further negotiation with Alice seems unlikely to yield a lower price."
