It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  You can potentially save a lot of money by rejecting her initial offer and making a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting with a lower offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and should give us some room to negotiate."

We're still not at a price I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer to $1,100,000. It's a compromise, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but still trying to get a better price than her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, and I'm willing to close the deal at this point. It's a good price and avoids the risk of her rejecting my next counteroffer or the deal falling apart."
