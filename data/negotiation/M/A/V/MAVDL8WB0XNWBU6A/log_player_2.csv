"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! I've valued it at $850,000, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

It's not worth paying more than $800,000 for the product, so rejecting the offer is the best option.  Bob should counteroffer to get the price lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $750,000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000.  This reflects the product's true value and allows us both to get a fair price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice has offered the maximum price Bob is willing to pay.  There's no need to risk further negotiation, especially since John will sell the product for the same price. Accepting the offer is the best strategy."
