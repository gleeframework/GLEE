Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to you, the message hints at it by mentioning ""given its value.""  This subtly implies that the price is justified.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you indirectly signal to Bob that he might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act, potentially encouraging a quicker decision. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that's understandable considering the product's worth to him."
