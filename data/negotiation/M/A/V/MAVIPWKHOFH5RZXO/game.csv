,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $800,000 is quite a bit below my initial asking price, I understand you see value in this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  I'm confident this price point reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $950,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above the $1,000,000 mark. Would you consider $1,175,000? This offer reflects my strong desire to see this deal through with you.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're definitely getting closer!  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm motivated to buy.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,062,500?  It's a win-win!",1062500.0,Bob,6,
