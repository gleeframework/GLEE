Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable amount, we're still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. We've set a clear bottom line of $1,000,000, and we have some room to negotiate before considering John's offer. Bob's eagerness suggests we can push a bit further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are close! I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I'm willing to concede a bit more, but I need to stay firm at $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair given the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  This counteroffer conveys a sense of urgency and finality while still being a reasonable compromise.
* **Justification:** Highlighting it's the ""final offer"" can encourage Bob to accept rather than risk the deal falling through. 
* **Alternative:**  We are getting close to our fallback option with John ($1,200,000). If Bob rejects this, we might need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round or two."
