Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $12,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable paying $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $13,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still not in a range where it's more beneficial to sell to him than to John.  We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get Bob closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $15,000 to make this work.  Would you consider $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to our guaranteed price with John, and there's a risk he won't go any higher. Accepting $14,500 now secures a good price and avoids the potential of losing both Bob and having to settle for John's offer."
