"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $12,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable paying $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $13,000.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $15,000 to make this work.  Would you consider $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,5,
