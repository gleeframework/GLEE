"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer in its industry, and I think you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're still interested, I can discuss further, but I won't go below $10000.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9200, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",9200.0,Bob,6,
