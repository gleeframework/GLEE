Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the ""incredible value and potential"" of the product to justify the high price, even though you know it's worth $1,500,000 to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open-ended (""What are your thoughts?"") to invite counter-offers from Bob and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price above your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiating style or financial limits. If you knew he was a tough negotiator, you might adjust your starting price slightly lower. 
* **Relationship Building:**  Even though you have a backup buyer, consider if maintaining a positive relationship with Bob for potential future deals is important. If so, a slightly less aggressive starting price might be preferable."
