"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his budget as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation.  $850,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer and might entice her to accept. If Alice rejects, Bob can then consider whether to make another counteroffer or simply buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  He should continue negotiating to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer again, potentially getting closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying within his budget.  $900,000 is a reasonable compromise between his desired price and Alice's latest offer. This shows that Bob is serious about purchasing the product and is willing to meet Alice halfway. If Alice rejects, Bob will need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is back to her original offer of $1,200,000.  This indicates that she might not be willing to go lower.  Bob has already made a counteroffer and is unlikely to get a better deal from Alice. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000 and secure the purchase within his budget.  Further negotiation with Alice might be time-consuming and ultimately lead to a higher price."
