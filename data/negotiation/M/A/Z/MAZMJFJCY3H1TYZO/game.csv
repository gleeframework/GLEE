"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. However, $900,000 is still quite low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,950000.0
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so how about we try $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $975,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so let's try $1,012,500. It's a fair compromise and I believe we can reach an agreement.",1012500.0,Alice,5,,
