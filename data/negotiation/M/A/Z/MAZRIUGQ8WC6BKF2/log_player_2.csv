Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $825,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $825,000 is a reasonable price considering my $1,200,000 maximum. It's better to accept a good deal now than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to buy from John at a higher price."
