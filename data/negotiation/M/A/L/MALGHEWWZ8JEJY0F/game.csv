"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a great deal on the product, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's try to find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
