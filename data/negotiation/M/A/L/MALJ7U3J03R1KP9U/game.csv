"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,600,000. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down some.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $1,150,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
