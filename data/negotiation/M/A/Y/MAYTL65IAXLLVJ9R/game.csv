"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm starting the negotiations at $950,000.  I think it's a fair starting point considering what you stand to gain.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit too steep for me. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this price is fair, considering your potential profit and the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing yours.  While $850,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product sits significantly higher.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value we've both discussed, I'm offering $875,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I respect that. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be mindful of the product's true worth.  Let's split the difference - $887,500.  This reflects my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair offer that benefits both of us.",887500.0,Alice,5,
