Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always best to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Leave Room for John:** Offering at $12,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down while still ensuring you can get your minimum ($10,000 from John) if needed.
* **Justify the Price:**  While a simple number is enough, hinting at the product's value might make Bob more receptive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $9,000 is better than nothing, but still less than John's guaranteed $10,000.
* There's room to negotiate further. Bob clearly wants the product and his counteroffer is closer to our desired range. We can likely get him higher than $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?"", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):** By suggesting $10,500, we're signaling a willingness to negotiate while staying closer to our desired price. This approach often feels fair to both parties.
* **Maintain Leverage:** We haven't dropped to John's price yet. This keeps pressure on Bob, showing we have other options.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is direct about the price while maintaining a collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's movement is minimal:**  Bob increased his offer by only $500. This suggests he might not be willing to go much higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiation has uncertain payoff. We could try for more from Bob, but he might not budge much, and we risk losing John's guaranteed $10,000.
* **John's offer is secure:** Accepting John's offer guarantees our minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation.

At this point, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential, but uncertain, gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob."
