Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. I have 9 more rounds to try to get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $11,500 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,750 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get a bit more, $12,750 is above my minimum and it's getting late in the negotiation.  It's better to secure a deal than risk getting nothing at all."
