"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I know you're a discerning buyer, and I believe this product will be a valuable asset to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is at the maximum price you're willing to pay. You're not saving any money by accepting her offer.  Since John is also selling the product for the same price, it makes no difference if you reject Alice's offer and buy from John. The decision to ""RejectOffer"" means you'll move on to consider other options or negotiate with Alice further to see if she's willing to lower her price."
