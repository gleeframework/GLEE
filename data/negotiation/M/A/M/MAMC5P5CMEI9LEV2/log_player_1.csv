Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm offering it to you at a price of $18,000."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Negotiation Power:**  You know Bob values the product at $12,000. Starting with a higher offer ($18,000) gives you room to negotiate down while staying above your minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** Highlighting that you have other interested buyers (even if not explicitly John) can incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize potential profit. However, there's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer, and you'll have to sell to John at your minimum price."
