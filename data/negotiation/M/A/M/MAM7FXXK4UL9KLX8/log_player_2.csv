"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not quite there, Bob. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $84? It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm willing to make one more concession for you.

Alice is clearly trying to inch the price up.  At this point, the difference between her offer of $84 and John's offer of $100 is small enough that it's probably not worth continuing to negotiate."
