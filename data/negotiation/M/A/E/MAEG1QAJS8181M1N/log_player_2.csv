"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is offering it to me for $2,000,000, which is too expensive. I'll look for a better deal elsewhere.
