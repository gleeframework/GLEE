"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.** You are not willing to pay more than that for the product.
* **While rejecting Alice's offer, you are not buying from John immediately.** You are simply rejecting Alice's offer and will consider buying from John if you can't find a better deal. 

This strategy allows you to explore other options and potentially get a lower price than what John is offering."
