# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While $9,500 is a decent price, you know you have a backup option at $10,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further if you reject this initial offer."
