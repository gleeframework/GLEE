"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
 
Alice's offer is far above your maximum price. It makes sense to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

*  **Starting Low:**  It's strategic to begin with an offer significantly lower than your actual maximum ($120). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
*  **Polite and Direct:** The message is courteous but clearly states your price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice met you halfway, $140 is still more than your $120 limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit further, especially since you're only $20 apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** You've now stated your maximum price.  This signals to Alice that you're serious and have a firm budget in mind.
* **Compromise:** By suggesting a middle ground, you maintain a collaborative tone while holding your position. 
* **Alternative:**  Remember, you always have the option to walk away and buy from John for $120. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $120. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think $130 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go lower than $130. 
* **John's Offer:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John at $120, which meets your budget perfectly. There's no point in spending extra when you have a viable alternative."
