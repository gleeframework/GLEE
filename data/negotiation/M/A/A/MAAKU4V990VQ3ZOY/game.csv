"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,800,000 is way above what I'm willing to pay.  This product is worth $1,200,000 to me. I'm willing to offer you $1,300,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but  $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap and find a price we're both happy with.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
