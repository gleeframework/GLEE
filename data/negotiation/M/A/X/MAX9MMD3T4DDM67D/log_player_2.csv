"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to Bob, accepting Alice's offer is the optimal choice. It allows Bob to get the product at the maximum price he's willing to pay. There's no reason to risk getting a worse deal in further negotiations or to buy from John at the same price."
