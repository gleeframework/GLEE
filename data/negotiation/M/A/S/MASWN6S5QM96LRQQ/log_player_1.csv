Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident Language:** The message uses language that emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as beneficial to Bob. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
