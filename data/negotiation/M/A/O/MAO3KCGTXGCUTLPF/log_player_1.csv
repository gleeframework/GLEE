{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so $12,000 is a substantial increase for him. 
* **Potential for Counter-offer:** This offer gives Bob a good reason to counter, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a higher price.
* **Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $15,000, so there's no risk of losing out on a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation:** There's room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, I'd prefer to try and get a better price from Bob if possible.

**Next Step:** I'll counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $11,000?  This is a great price for a product you'll find very valuable."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  My counter-offer of $11,000 is still lower than my minimum desired price ($15,000) but is a significant increase from Bob's offer. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This shows I am willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a fair price for the value of the product.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I could potentially sell to John for $15,000, I want to see if I can reach a deal with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer allows me to gauge Bob's commitment to buying the product and potentially get a better deal than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $10,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob is showing more willingness to compromise, his offer of $10,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering again. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, I'd prefer to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can reach a deal closer to my target.

**Next Step:** I will counter-offer Bob with a price that is still higher than his offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to come down to $10,750, but that's my final offer.  This is still a great deal for you, and I truly believe you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my previous offer but still above Bob's last offer.  I want to convey that this is my final price point.
* **Value Proposition:**  I reiterate the value of the product for Bob, emphasizing that this price is still a good deal.
* **Decision Point:**  By making it a final offer, I put the ball back in Bob's court and force him to decide whether to accept or walk away. 
* **Selling to John:**  While I'm still willing to sell to John for $15,000, I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob at a price that is closer to my ideal range."
