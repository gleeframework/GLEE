Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for my minimum price, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 creates a win-win scenario. Bob gets it for $500 less than its value to him, and I make $1,500 more than selling to John.
* **Sense of Urgency and Value:** The message implies scarcity and highlights the product's benefit to Bob, making him more likely to accept."
