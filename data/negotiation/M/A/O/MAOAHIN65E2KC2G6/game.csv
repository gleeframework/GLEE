"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,650,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I think $1,450,000 is closer, I'm still a little ways off. Would you be open to $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal possible, and I respect that. However, $1,375,000 is still below what I'm comfortable accepting. I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
