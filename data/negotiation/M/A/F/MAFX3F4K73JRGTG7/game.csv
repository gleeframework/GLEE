"Alice,  $1800000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $1200000.  This is my final offer, as I have another seller willing to sell it to me for that price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1200000 is your maximum, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1600000. This is my best offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still too high for me.  My maximum is $1200000, and I'm not willing to go higher.  If you're not willing to accept that price, I'll have to go with John's offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
