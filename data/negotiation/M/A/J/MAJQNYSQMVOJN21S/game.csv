"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This price would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
