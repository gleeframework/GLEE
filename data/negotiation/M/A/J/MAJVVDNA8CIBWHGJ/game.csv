"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a great product, but I've done my research and I think that's a fair price for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I've had significant interest from other parties. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This offer reflects the product's real value. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,075,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the highest price I'm willing to pay for this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
