"Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $2000000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value and my limited budget. Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1750000. This price still allows you a considerable margin for profit, and it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the potential value and my budget constraints. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This price still allows for a significant gain on your end, and it's a fair reflection of the product's unique qualities. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1600000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000 for this product. It's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my willingness to compromise.  Let's see if we can finally find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still quite a bit lower than what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's unique value and still allows for a reasonable profit for you. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a significant step up from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product.  Let's try to reach a final agreement this round.  If not, I'll need to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
