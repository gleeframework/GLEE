"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your initial price. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $1,400,000 falls a bit short of what I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but $1,750,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
