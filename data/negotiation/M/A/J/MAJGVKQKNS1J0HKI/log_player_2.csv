"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $2,000,000 is far beyond his budget of $800,000. He can try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $2,000,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. This is my best and final offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. Consider this my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a better price than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He should reject the offer and continue negotiating with Alice or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 just doesn't cut it.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away with a win. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his target of $800,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price. He can also consider buying from John if he feels like the negotiation with Alice won't lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to earn a decent profit while I stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 950000}
