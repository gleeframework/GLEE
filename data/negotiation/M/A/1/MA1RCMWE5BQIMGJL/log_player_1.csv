Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $12,000.  While there's a chance he might go slightly higher, it's unlikely he'll reach our desired price range. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer or reaching a stalemate.  Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price."
