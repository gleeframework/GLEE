# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1500000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value you place on the product.
