"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1500000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value you place on the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. My revised offer for the product is $1250000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. Given the value of this product to you, and my maximum budget, I'm offering $1100000 as my final price. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

This price reflects a reasonable compromise while still acknowledging the value of the product to both parties. I hope this proposal aligns better with your financial considerations.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
