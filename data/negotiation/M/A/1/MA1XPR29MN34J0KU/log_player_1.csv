{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and Bob's offer is below that. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I can't go as low as $7,500, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks again for your flexibility.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $7500.  Would you consider $8000?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is at my minimum acceptable price.  It's better than selling to John for the same price, and leaves me more room to negotiate if we continue.  I'll accept the offer and secure the deal."
