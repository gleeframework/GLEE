"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1400000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for anything below my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's significantly more valuable to you than that.

Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1300000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for a lower price. I'm prepared to offer $1250000. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal. Let's find a solution that works for everyone. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I have several rounds left, and I believe I can still secure a better deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I will not settle for anything less than $1,300,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but I'm hoping we can find a way to split the difference. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer a higher price, I've already made several concessions, and it's getting close to the point where it might be more profitable to sell to John.  Accepting this offer secures a solid profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
