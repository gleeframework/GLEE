"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is far above Bob's budget. It makes more sense to reject and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob is starting with a significant discount, hoping to get a better deal and gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still too high. While $18,000 is closer to Bob's budget, there's still room for negotiation and Bob should try to get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly but still keeping it significantly lower than Alice's offer. This shows that he's willing to negotiate but also that he has a clear budget in mind."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While the price is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his desired price point. He should continue to negotiate for a better deal before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob is getting close to his maximum budget. He's offering a price that's only $1000 away from his backup option. He's hoping this will be enough to convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has only 3 rounds left. Even though Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's not enough to justify rejecting her offer.  He's risking running out of time and being forced to accept a price he's not comfortable with. Therefore, it's more prudent to buy from John at his set price, guaranteeing a purchase within his budget."
