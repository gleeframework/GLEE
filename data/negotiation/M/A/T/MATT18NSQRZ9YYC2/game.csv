"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've done my research and I know the market value of this product is high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
