"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's valuation of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000. That's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her valuation, leaving room for negotiation. It also signals that Bob is serious about making a deal but isn't willing to pay the full asking price. This strategy aims to quickly narrow the price gap and encourage Alice to consider a deal within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the value of the product while still giving you a great deal.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm still looking to pay around $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and helps us both reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step up from Bob's previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's offer. It shows Bob is willing to compromise but is still holding firm on his desire for a lower price. This strategy aims to further narrow the price gap and gauge Alice's willingness to budge further."
