Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $8,000**, giving you a good profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum value of $15,000**, giving him a chance to get a good deal.

This strategy maximizes your chances of getting a higher price while also being appealing enough for Bob to potentially accept."
