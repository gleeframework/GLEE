"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you:** You value the product at $15,000 and Alice is offering it for $12,000. This means you save $3,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Rejecting the offer is worse:**  Rejecting Alice's offer forces you to buy from John for a higher price."
