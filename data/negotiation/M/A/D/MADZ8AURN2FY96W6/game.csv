"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm open to further discussion.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high. Would you consider $700,000?  I believe that's a fair price that allows you to make a reasonable profit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be careful not to lose too much. I'm counteroffering at $800,000. This is my final compromise, and I expect you to meet me at this price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
