"I'm excited to offer you this great opportunity to purchase this product. I think it's a fantastic deal for you at a price of $14,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm confident you'll love it.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to make the deal if you are.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'll throw in a small concession. I'll meet you at $10,500, and that's my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
