We're getting closer, but $90 is still above our target price and what John is offering. Let's see if we can negotiate further."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you found the previous proposal satisfactory, Bob.

This is slightly higher than your last offer but still within my desired range. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $85 is a decent price compared to John's $80 offer. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
