Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $11,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging to hopefully get Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

I'll be ready to counter if Bob rejects this offer, but I want to see if I can close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation room:** I still have room to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price.  
* **John's offer:**  While John is offering my minimum price, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob before locking in with John. 

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm emphasizing that the price is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Maintaining my minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  

I'm confident that I can get Bob to accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob has come up a bit, $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation room:**  I have room to negotiate further. Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, so I believe I can get a better price.
* **John's offer:**  John is offering my minimum price, but I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob before going with him.

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $10,000, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a final compromise, meeting Bob halfway at his desired price point of under $10,000. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Avoiding John:**  While John's offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price from Bob.

I'm confident that this offer is the best I can do while still meeting my minimum requirements."
