"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $10,000, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
