"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $700,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value. While $700,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move closer to your range. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is still above my target, I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
