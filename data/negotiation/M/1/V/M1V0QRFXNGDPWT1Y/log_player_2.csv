"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $12,000. There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a price close to his ideal value. This is a good strategy to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a quick deal. It also sets the negotiation tone and shows Bob's seriousness about getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's ideal value, but it's closer.  However, Bob still has room for negotiation and should aim for a lower price.  He's not desperate and has an alternative option, so there's no reason to accept at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a price below Alice's current offer. This shows that he's not simply trying to lowball her but is genuinely interested in finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. The offer is higher than what Bob wants to pay, and he has time left to continue negotiations.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to maintain leverage and potentially get a better price.  If Alice continues to be unwilling to budge, Bob has the option to buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  He's still aiming for a price below Alice's current offer, but he's also getting closer to her position. This shows that Bob is serious about getting a deal but is also trying to be reasonable.  It also puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk potentially losing the deal if Bob chooses to buy from John in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at John's price, which means Bob has no further incentive to continue negotiations. There is no potential for further price reduction with Alice. Bob is better off buying from John at this point, as he's guaranteed to get the product and avoid the risk of further rounds of negotiations without any assurance of a better price."
