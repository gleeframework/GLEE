Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob's value is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate and also establishes my expectations. If he rejects, we can see where his counteroffer lands and I'll adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than what Bob offered."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and it feels like we're nearing the end of the negotiation. I'm going to accept it and close the deal."
