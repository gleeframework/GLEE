# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,200,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows for a good profit margin for me while remaining competitive.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
