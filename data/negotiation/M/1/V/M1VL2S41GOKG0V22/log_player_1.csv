Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting in the middle.
* **Time Value & Certainty:** Offering it to Bob first at a slightly discounted rate acknowledges his interest and provides a quicker, more certain sale than waiting for John.

This strategy balances getting the best price from Bob while still ensuring a sale at your minimum acceptable price if he declines."
