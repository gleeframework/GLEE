I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $1,285,000 is still below my minimum. Although John is only offering my absolute minimum, I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob, especially since he's already mentioned buying from John. I'm better off taking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
