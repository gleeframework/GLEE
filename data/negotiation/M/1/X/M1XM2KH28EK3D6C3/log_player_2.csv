Alice's offer is far too high.  It's in my best interest to counteroffer and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?  I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.

Alice's counteroffer is still too high.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
