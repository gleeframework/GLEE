Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given its worth to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to potentially benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?  I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,300,000. It's a fair price that allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. If we can't reach an agreement, I'm prepared to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Bob seems firmly anchored at $1,300,000 and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. Accepting his offer would be a $200,000 loss compared to John's offer.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
