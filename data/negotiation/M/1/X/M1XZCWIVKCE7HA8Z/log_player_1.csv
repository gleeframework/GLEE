Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm interested in selling the product to him,  $900,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I still have several rounds to negotiate and can also sell to John for $1,000,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and still gives you a good deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds to negotiate.  I'd like to see if we can close the gap even further.  I'm also still considering selling to John, which would be a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still not enough for me. Let's meet at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering your stated value for the product.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to propose a price of $975,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $975,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my target price. I'm also keeping the option to sell to John open, just in case."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $975,000 still isn't enough for me. I'm proposing a final price of $987,500.

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'm still interested in selling to Bob, the negotiations haven't yielded a price close to my minimum acceptable amount.  It's better to guarantee a sale at $1,000,000 than to risk further negotiation and possibly not reaching a deal with Bob."
