"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $17,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer though. How about $16,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm happy to move on and consider other options.",15500.0,Bob,4,
