"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the value of the product for Bob can encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $100, there's room for Bob to counter-offer, and for us to adjust our price if necessary. 
* **Option to Sell to John:**  We have the option to sell to John for $120, which gives us a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  Our goal is to maximize profit. While $90 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation:** We're in a strong position. We have the option to sell to John for $120, giving us leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to counter with a price closer to our target.  We can explore a counteroffer closer to $100, still leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $95? This still offers you a great value, and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Offering $95 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price above our minimum.
* **Value Proposition:**  We highlight the ""great value"" for Bob to encourage acceptance.
* **Flexibility:** Leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

**Strategy:**

By gradually lowering our price while still staying above our minimum, we aim to find a compromise that both parties are comfortable with.  We are also aware of our option to sell to John, giving us confidence in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given your offer some thought. Considering my budget, I think I can agree to $92 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $92 is very close to our initial offer of $95, and significantly closer to our minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might further lower his offer or even walk away entirely. Accepting $92 guarantees a sale and a decent profit.
* **Time Factor:**  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. Accepting the offer at this point minimizes further delays and ensures a quick sale. 

**Important Note:** The decision to accept or reject Bob's offer is a strategic one.  While we could continue the negotiation, accepting $92 minimizes risk and ensures a relatively quick sale with a good profit."
