"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $100 by many of our satisfied customers. Given its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe it's worth more than $80 to you. Would you like to make an offer closer to its true value? If not, I can also sell it to another interested party, John, for $100.",95.0,Alice,1,
