"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $10000.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12000.  This is the absolute most I can afford to pay.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $13500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $12500.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,6,
