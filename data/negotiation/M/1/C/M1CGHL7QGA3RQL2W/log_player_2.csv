(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $180 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we try $155? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to try and negotiate further, but I'm getting close to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $155 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to split the difference and offer you $125. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a minimum of $160 to be happy. How about we try $145? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $145 is getting closer to my limit, but it's still not within my budget. I've already rejected two offers and made two counteroffers, and it seems like we're not reaching a mutually agreeable price. To avoid wasting any more time, I'm going to buy the product from John for $100.  It's a sure thing and I'm confident I can get a better deal than what Alice is currently offering."
