"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price.  I'm starting with an offer of $9500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $9000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9000 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9250? This would allow both of us to get a good deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $9150? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",9150.0,Bob,4,
