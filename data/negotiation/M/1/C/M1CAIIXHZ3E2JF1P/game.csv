"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to work together. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1050000 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us and aligns better with my financial situation.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1050000 is unfortunately too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product.  I'm proposing a price of $1100000. This still leaves significant room for you to benefit from this acquisition. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go as low as $1075000. It's important to me that I receive a price that reflects the true value of this product. To make a final compromise, I'm offering you the product for $1090000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a decent profit while still offering you a significant value.  Let's finalize this deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
