"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $110 is a decent price, there's potential to negotiate a better deal with Alice. It's unlikely she'll offer her lowest acceptable price right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer aims to significantly lower the price while leaving room for further negotiation. It also expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. While $100 is a good price, we started at $90, and there's still a chance to meet closer to that number with another counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($100) and our previous counter-offer ($90). It shows a willingness to compromise while still striving for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $98. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has signaled that this is her final offer. While we could try to haggle further, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting at $98 secures a good discount from the original price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
