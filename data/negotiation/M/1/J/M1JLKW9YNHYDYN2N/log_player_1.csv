Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering it's worth $10,000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it's below my minimum price.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with him in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 for you. This is still a great deal considering the value to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate you coming down. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250

While $9,250 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still determined to get as close to my desired price as possible.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
