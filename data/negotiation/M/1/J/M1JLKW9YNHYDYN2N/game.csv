"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering it's worth $10,000 to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 for you. This is still a great deal considering the value to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate you coming down. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit low. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for you, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
