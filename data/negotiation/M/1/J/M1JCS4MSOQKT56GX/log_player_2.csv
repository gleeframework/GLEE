{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000.** This is higher than the product's value to Alice ($1,200,000) but still within your budget.
* **John's price is $1,500,000.** This is the upper limit of your budget.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice.** You can still get the product from John for $1,500,000, which is higher than Alice's offer, but still within your budget. This means you can try to negotiate a lower price with John or wait for a better offer."
