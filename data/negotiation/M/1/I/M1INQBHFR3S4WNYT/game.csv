"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm aiming for a price that's closer to our mutual benefit. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a price that's closer to your target. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,150,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
