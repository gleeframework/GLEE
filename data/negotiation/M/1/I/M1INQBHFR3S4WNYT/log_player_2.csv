"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal. You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and you know Alice is willing to sell for $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore this potential."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm aiming for a price that's closer to our mutual benefit. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but you're also pushing for a better price. It's a significant step towards your desired price point while still being reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a price that's closer to your target. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,150,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is within your budget and represents a good compromise. You've already established some negotiating ground, and continuing to push for a lower price risks jeopardizing the deal.  

Since you're still saving $350,000 compared to buying from John, accepting this offer is the most financially beneficial decision at this point."
