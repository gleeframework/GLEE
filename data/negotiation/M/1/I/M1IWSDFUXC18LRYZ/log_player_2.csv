"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $120. This is above Bob's limit, so he should reject the offer.  He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering or going to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

Alice's offer of $110 is still above Bob's maximum price of $100. At this point, it makes more sense for Bob to buy the product from John for $100, ensuring he gets the product at his desired price.  Further negotiation with Alice risks going above his limit."
