"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $107.50. Let's meet in the middle.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $107.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $101.25. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy. What do you say?",101.25,Alice,5,
