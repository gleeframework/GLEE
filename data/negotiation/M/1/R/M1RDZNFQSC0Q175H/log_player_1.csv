"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable offer:**  $130 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $80.
* **Positive message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging to hopefully build rapport and avoid immediate rejection. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, while still allowing me to potentially earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $85 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my desired range.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting his offer, I can counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John guarantees $150, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $107.50. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($85). This shows a willingness to compromise and find a fair price.
* **Reasonable price:**  $107.50 is still a good profit for me, and is a significant improvement on Bob's offer.
* **Positive and encouraging message:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiations.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I'm leaving room for further back-and-forth in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $107.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:**  While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price and leaves me with a smaller profit. 
* **Final offer:**  Although Bob claims it's his final offer, there's still room for negotiation.  
* **Potential for a higher price:**  I believe I can still convince Bob to pay a bit more, especially since my previous offer was already a compromise.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John guarantees $150, but I'm hoping to get a better deal from Bob by continuing the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $101.25. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 101.25}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by continuing to meet Bob halfway. This shows a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Fair price:**  $101.25 represents a significant improvement for Bob, yet still allows me to make a reasonable profit.
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario, emphasizing that it's a fair price for both parties.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By not accepting Bob's offer, I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

At this point, I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a decent price and avoiding a stalemate. I'm willing to continue compromising slightly, but I won't go any lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150) if Bob doesn't budge."
