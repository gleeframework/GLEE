Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective. While $1,900,000 represents the high end of the product's value,  $1,000,000 undervalues it significantly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of what's being offered.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you be open to $1,325,000? That's a significant compromise on my initial price, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll go below $1,200,000.  John offers a guaranteed price that meets my needs.  It's time to cut bait with Alice."
