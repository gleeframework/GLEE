"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I think it could really benefit your business.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my counteroffer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $950,000?

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $725,000? I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 725000}"
