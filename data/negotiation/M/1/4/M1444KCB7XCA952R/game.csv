"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. I would be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is considerably below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  I could consider a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
