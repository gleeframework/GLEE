{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  A $12,000 offer allows for some flexibility on my end while also demonstrating that I'm serious about selling to him.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage in negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll monitor Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, possibly dropping the price slightly, but always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price ($15,000 from John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, even considering my own valuation of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Opportunity for a Better Price:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I can afford to be more patient and see if I can get a better offer from Bob.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my target. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming for a middle ground between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise by lowering the price from $12,000 to $10,500. 
* **Middle Ground:** This price is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, potentially appealing to him.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone will keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he rejects it, I might consider lowering the price further, but I'll always be prepared to sell to John for $15,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would mean selling the product for a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can counteroffer again and see if we can reach a price closer to my target.
* **Guaranteed Buyer:**  Since John is willing to buy the product for $15,000, I have a strong fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer again with a slightly lower price, but I'll aim to keep it above my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $9,800 is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $10,150? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm making a final offer, aiming to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Fair Price:** The price is closer to Bob's perceived value, demonstrating my willingness to compromise, while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm using language that suggests a finality to the offer, encouraging Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully monitor Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll proceed with selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $10,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,900. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Much Risk:**  While $9,900 is only $250 less than my last offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  The risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with an even lower price is too high.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum desired outcome.
* **Limited Time:** There's no guarantee that Bob will eventually agree to a price that is acceptable to me.  It's better to secure the guaranteed profit with John than risk further negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll contact John and finalize the sale."
