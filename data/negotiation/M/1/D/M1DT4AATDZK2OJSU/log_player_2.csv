"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present this extraordinary opportunity to you. The product I have to offer is truly unique and holds immense value for me, but I believe it could be equally valuable to you. Before we proceed, I want to ensure that we're on the same page regarding its worth. Therefore, I propose a price of $15000 for the product. This price reflects not only its intrinsic value but also my desire to see it go to someone who appreciates it as much as I do. If this proposal aligns with your expectations, please let me know, and we can move forward with the transaction.
