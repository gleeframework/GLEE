"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $85, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $98. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $98 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $90.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",90.0,Bob,6,
