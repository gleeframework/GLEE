Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] before I open it up to other buyers. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit, Minimize Risk:**  While we could start higher, aiming just below your guaranteed price with John ($1,200,000) minimizes the risk of Bob outright rejecting the offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for some negotiation downward while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Exclusive Opportunity:** Highlighting the exclusivity and potential of the product adds perceived value for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer seriously."
