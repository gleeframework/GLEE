"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer. It's important to remember that Alice values the product at $1,000,000, so there's a significant gap to bridge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  A counteroffer of $1,200,000 represents a substantial price reduction from Alice's initial offer, while still leaving some room for negotiation. This offer is close enough to Alice's valuation to make it attractive, but still leaves room for Alice to negotiate if she needs to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's a significant discount from John's price of $1,500,000, and it's likely that further negotiation won't bring the price down much further.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but it's not clear if she'll budge much more. Accepting the offer is a good balance of saving money and avoiding the risk of a lengthy negotiation."
