"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is too high for me. Given my valuation and the current market, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, reflecting his valuation. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation without immediately rejecting the deal entirely.
* **Fairness:**  Bob emphasizes a fair price that benefits both parties to potentially appeal to Alice's desire for a quick sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob has 7 rounds left and can still try to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Buying from John at $800,000 is always an option, but there's a good chance Bob can secure a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

Round 4

This price allows for a reasonable profit for you while getting me closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is still below my target price. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $925,000.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering the value you place on the product and the value I place on it, I'm willing to offer it to you for $918,000. This is a slight increase from your latest offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $918,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $918,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
