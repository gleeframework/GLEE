"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($9,500) is better than John's offer ($10,000).** 
* You're trying to save as much money as possible, and Alice's price is lower. 
* Even though Alice's price is higher than what the product is worth to her ($8,000), it's still a good deal for you."
