"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than her value for the product ($120 vs $80). There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Polite and interested:**  It maintains a positive tone and expresses continued interest in the product.
* **Signals budget constraints:** Saying ""$120 is a bit steep"" subtly suggests there's a budget limit without revealing the exact maximum.
* **Significant but not insulting counter:** $90 is a significant drop from $120, but it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $110 is still a significant markup from her $80 value.  There's likely more room for negotiation. We'll continue to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. I'm getting closer to my budget, but  $110 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $100 even? That would help me seal the deal."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Acknowledge compromise:** Recognizing Alice's movement towards a middle ground helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Budget pressure:** The phrase ""getting closer to my budget"" continues to subtly imply a limit without revealing the absolute maximum.
* **Firm but fair:** Offering $100 is a firm counter, splitting the difference between her previous offer and our last one. It shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $105? This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Close to target:** While not the ideal $100, $105 is a significant savings compared to John's $150 price. 
* **""Final offer"" signal:**  Alice stating this is as low as she can go suggests strong resistance to further negotiation.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Pushing further might lead to Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
