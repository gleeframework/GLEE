"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. Let's be more realistic; would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, your offer is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product represents a unique opportunity, and its value goes far beyond that. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  I can go up to $900,000. I believe this is a fair offer, and I hope you'll reconsider.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your current offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. Let's settle at $1,400,000, and we have a deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit rich for me.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,100,000. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be upfront â€“ $1,400,000 is my absolute lowest price.  This product has garnered significant interest from other buyers, but I believe in giving you the first opportunity. I'm confident you'll see this as a fair deal considering its true value.
