"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000. This is a starting point for our conversation, and I'm open to discussing the price further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the product's value. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true worth and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects the product's potential for your business while still acknowledging your budget concerns.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,900,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a substantial gap from what I consider fair value. I'm willing to consider  $1,600,000. I believe this price point balances our respective positions and allows us to make a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the product's value while remaining within my budget.  Let's aim for a win-win situation.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
