"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you. ",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but I'd like to propose a price of $875,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $900,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's close this deal at $900,000. ",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're not willing to go lower than $900,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,6,
