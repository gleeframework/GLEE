"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about $1,600,000? This is a fair compromise, and it still allows you to gain significant value from the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about $1,550,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
