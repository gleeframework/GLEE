Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit from Bob, who values the product significantly more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $12,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Strong but Fair:** This price recognizes Bob's higher valuation while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the safety net of John, ensuring you won't be left without a buyer.

This strategy balances ambition with a degree of realism, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale at a favorable price."
