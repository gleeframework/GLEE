"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still being within your budget. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,250. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
