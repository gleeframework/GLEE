{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, and I'm leaving room to negotiate if Bob isn't happy with it. I'm confident I can get at least $11,500 from Bob, which is more than what John is offering.  I'll use the information from Bob's response to determine my next steps."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  While I'd like to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm going to counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still being within your budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,250. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer from him. While it's less than what I initially wanted, it's still a good deal for me, and it avoids having to sell to John for $12,000.  I'm happy to accept his offer."
