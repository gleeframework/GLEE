{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $10,000. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to counter if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter. $12,000 is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can get a better price. I'm willing to go back and forth a few more rounds before selling to John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it will encourage him to accept.  If not, I'm prepared to go lower in the next round, but still trying to secure a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $12,500 is still above my minimum and it's clear that Bob won't budge much further.  It's not ideal, but it's a good deal and I'm confident I can make up for the lower price in other ways."
