{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

This counteroffer is a compromise. It shows Alice that you're willing to negotiate but also that you're not willing to go too much lower. It's a reasonable step closer to her previous offer and leaves room for another counteroffer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and her offer is now very close to your target price. At this point, it's more advantageous to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price rather than risk further negotiation.  While you could potentially get a slightly better price, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept your next counteroffer. It's important to weigh the potential savings against the risk of losing the deal."
