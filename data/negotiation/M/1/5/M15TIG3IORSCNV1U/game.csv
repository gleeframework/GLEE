"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to go up to $950,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price given the value to both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,050,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price given the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
