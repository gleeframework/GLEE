Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point. It's a bit higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also optimistic that Bob will find the price reasonable considering its worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can come to a more reasonable agreement. How about offering the product at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $9,500, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price, either through further negotiations with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $10,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to sell for more, it's a fair deal considering the value to him and the potential of further negotiations potentially leading to a stalemate. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of a longer negotiation process or having to sell to John at the same price."
