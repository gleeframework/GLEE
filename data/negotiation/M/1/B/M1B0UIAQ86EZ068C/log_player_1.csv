Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think I can do better. How about $95? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay under $100.

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go above $100.  It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than to continue haggling with Bob for a potentially insignificant gain."
