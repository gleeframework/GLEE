"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This still leaves you with a good value, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. How about $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go down to $10,875.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",10875.0,Alice,5,
