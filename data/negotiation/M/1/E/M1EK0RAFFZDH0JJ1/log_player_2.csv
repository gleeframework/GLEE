"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's minimum selling price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This still leaves you with a good value, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $11,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  By rejecting, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. How about $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go down to $10,875.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows us to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,875 is very close to Bob's ideal price of $10,750.  At this point, it makes sense to accept the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation or potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
