Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the potential savings for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,600,000? This reflects the product's true worth and ensures a beneficial outcome for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows for both of us to gain something from this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  Bob is firmly rooted at $1,300,000, which is significantly less than John's guaranteed offer.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a very low chance of getting me closer to my desired price, and risks losing John's offer altogether."
