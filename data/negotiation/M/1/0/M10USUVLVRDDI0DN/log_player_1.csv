Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850000 for it, which I believe reflects the value I see and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
