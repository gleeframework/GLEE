"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000, which I think reflects the product's value and potential for growth. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850000 for it, which I believe reflects the value I see and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my best price for now, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This offer allows me to make the purchase within my budget while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is my final offer for now, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
