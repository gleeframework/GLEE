"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000, still above my minimum, but demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  This shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but I'm also holding firm to my value of the product."
