"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate, but $700,000 is still a bit below my target. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that balances the value of the product with the value you're willing to pay.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  To be totally transparent, my budget caps out at $750,000.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your transparency. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to meet my minimum requirement. I can offer the product to you for $825,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I also have a budget I need to stick to.  Perhaps we can find some middle ground.  How about $780,000? This shows I'm willing to move up, but I need you to meet me partway as well.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $780,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I can offer the product to you for $812,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",812500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting quite drawn out, isn't it?  I'm willing to make one final offer to avoid wasting both of our time further.  If you'll agree to $795,000, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have to pursue other options.",795000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to close the deal, but I'm not willing to accept $795,000. I've already made several concessions, and I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to make one last offer, and that's $825,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for the full $1,000,000.",825000.0,Alice,9,
