Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, I can aim higher with Bob. 
* **First Offer Anchor:**  Starting with a higher price ($15,000) sets an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, I'm likely to get a price higher than my fallback option.
* **Potential for Higher Value:** While Bob values the product at $10,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium for exclusivity or to avoid missing out."
