"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Margin:** The price is still within a reasonable range considering the product's worth to me ($1,500,000). 
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage.

This strategy aims to secure a good price while leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on his response and keep the possibility of selling to John in mind if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is not acceptable, it shows he's interested. Rejecting this offer gives me a chance to counter and find a middle ground.
* **Better Deal with John:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safer option at this point, but it's still too early to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my ideal value, but still open to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,600,000?  This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain Value:**  $1,600,000 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing out on the deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm staying open to negotiation and making it clear that I'm willing to work with Bob to find a mutually beneficial solution.

This counteroffer allows me to maintain a strong negotiating position while demonstrating flexibility and increasing the likelihood of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is not acceptable, it shows he's willing to go slightly higher. Rejecting this offer gives me a chance to counter and find a middle ground.
* **Sell to John is Getting Closer:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is becoming more appealing, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my ideal value, but still open to compromise.  If Bob rejects my next offer, I will consider selling to John as the negotiations are approaching the halfway point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This is a fair price, given the product's value, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is again a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain Value:**  $1,550,000 is just $50,000 below my minimum, so I'm still getting a good price for the product. 
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency by suggesting a ""fair price"" and emphasizing the need for a solution.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while demonstrating flexibility and increasing the pressure on Bob to accept a deal before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,475,000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,475,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. However, it's still below that point.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk that Bob will continue to make small increases, never reaching my minimum.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is a guaranteed deal, and it's only $25,000 more than Bob's current offer.  

**Next Steps:**

With limited rounds remaining, the risk of Bob not meeting my minimum price is increasing.  Selling to John guarantees a good deal and avoids further negotiation that may not be fruitful."
