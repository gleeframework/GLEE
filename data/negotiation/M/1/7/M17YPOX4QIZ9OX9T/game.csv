"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price point, so feel free to share your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I can go.",12000.0,Bob,4,
