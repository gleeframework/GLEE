"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't accept $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,000.
