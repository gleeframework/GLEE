"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $90.  Let me know what you think!",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to compromise.  I'll meet you halfway at $97.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal. Let's close it!",97.5,Alice,5,
