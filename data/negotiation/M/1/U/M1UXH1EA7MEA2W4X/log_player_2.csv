"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are trying to get the product for $80 or less.  Alice's offer of $110 is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $90.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** We're aiming for $80 or less. A counteroffer of $90 is a reasonable starting point.
* **Room for negotiation:**  It leaves room for Alice to counter with a lower price. 
* **Keeping it civil:** The message remains friendly and keeps the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** $100 is still more than you're willing to pay.
* **Room for negotiation:** You can still get the product for $80 from John. 
* **Strategic rejection:** Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation going and may encourage her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying and are willing to compromise.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  $95 is halfway between your last offer and Alice's offer.
* **Maintaining a friendly tone:**  The message stays polite and encourages further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise.  I'll meet you halfway at $97.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal. Let's close it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not close enough:** While $97.50 is lower than Alice's previous offers, it's still above your target price of $80.
* **Opportunity cost:**  You've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice is likely to continue haggling. There's a risk that you'll spend more time and still not get the desired price.
* **Guaranteed alternative:** John offers a guaranteed deal for $80.  This is a better and more reliable option at this point.

**In short:**  It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing. You'll get a better price and save time by buying from John."
