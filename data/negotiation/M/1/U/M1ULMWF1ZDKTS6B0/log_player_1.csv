{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value.  I'm asking for $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price.  I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, and I'm confident that I can get closer to my target. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, I'm not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $7,250?  I'm confident you'll find this to be a great deal."", ""product_price"": 7250}
``` 
I'm proposing a price halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still trying to get a good price for the product. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to encourage him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I'm really trying to be reasonable here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I would like to get a higher price, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially get an even lower offer.  It's time to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
