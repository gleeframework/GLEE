Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite limited. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is below my bottom line.  Could you meet me halfway at $10,750? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 10750}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I still believe that $9,500 is a fair price for the product. I'm not willing to go above that. Let me know if this is acceptable or if there's anything else we can discuss. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Bob seems firm on his $9,500 offer.  Rather than continue to negotiate and potentially lose John's offer, it's in my best interest to take the guaranteed $10,000."
