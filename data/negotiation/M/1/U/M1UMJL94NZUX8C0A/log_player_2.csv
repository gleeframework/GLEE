**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still above your ideal price.  Since you can get the product from John for $1,000,000, there's room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a better price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I can sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, while also acknowledging the value it holds for you. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still slightly above what you're willing to pay. You can still potentially negotiate further and get a better deal. There's also the option of buying from John for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're close to a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. I believe it's worth more than that to me, and I'm willing to hold out for a better price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,075,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay, and it seems like she's not budging further.  Since you can get the product from John for $1,000,000, it's the most sensible option to go with John and avoid further negotiation."
