"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice's offer of $900,000 is too high. 
* You have room to negotiate, and it's worth trying to get a better price. 
*  You can always buy from John for $800,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. 
* I'm aiming for a price closer to my valuation of $800,000, while still leaving room for potential negotiation.
*  I want to show Alice that I'm serious about buying but am not going to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is closer to my valuation, I'm still willing to try and negotiate a lower price.
*  There's a possibility I can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds, and I want to avoid paying a premium if possible.
* The risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice is manageable, as I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm now offering Alice my maximum price, which is also the price I'm willing to pay from John.
* By offering this, I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about buying and that there's not much more room for negotiation.
* I'm hoping that Alice, being willing to sell for $800,000, will accept my offer, saving us both further negotiation rounds."
