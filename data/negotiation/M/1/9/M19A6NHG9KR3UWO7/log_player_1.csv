Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll see if Bob bites, but I'm prepared to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to get. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. It's a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum target.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is now offering my minimum price, so there's no need to risk losing him by continuing to negotiate. I'll accept his offer and move on."
