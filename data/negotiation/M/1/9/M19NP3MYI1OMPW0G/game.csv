"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $110? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I'm willing to pay a bit more to get the product, but I'd like to stay within my budget as much as possible.",108.0,Bob,4,
