"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $11,000 is still above your maximum budget. You should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $10,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10750. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your target price, you can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  You're still willing to pay a bit more than John's price, but you should see if you can get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $10,750 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. Would you consider $10,600? This would make the deal very attractive for me, and I believe we could finalize it quickly."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should **reject** Alice's offer. While it's tempting to accept, you're still above your ideal price and John is offering the product for $10,000. It's worth seeing if you can push Alice further down or go with John if you don't think you'll get a better offer from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $10,700? This would be a great price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10700}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $10700 is still a bit above your target price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose **""BuyFromJhon""**. Alice's offer of $10,900 is still above your budget, and you've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  It's likely that Alice won't budge further, and you're running out of time.  Buying from John at $10,000 is the best option to secure the product within your budget."
