Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you might be interested in. My asking price is $170. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $150. I'm not ready to give up just yet and will try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $100 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $140 is the absolute lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you have a bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Although $120 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal $150. Given that I have John waiting to buy the product at my desired price, I'm going to sell the product to John.  I don't want to risk further negotiations with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
