"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a bit closer to my original price.  How about $1,100,000? I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. How about $950,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $1,050,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm trying to be reasonable, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. How about $900,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to come down a little further.  However, $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  How about $975,000?  It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but $975,000 is still too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be at $850,000 or less. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,8,
