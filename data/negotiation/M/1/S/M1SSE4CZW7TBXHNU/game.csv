"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $110 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140?  It's a fair price considering the value it brings.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a good deal on this valuable product.",135.0,Alice,5,

"This is a good product Alice, but I need to keep my budget in check.  My best offer is $120, and that's only if I buy it right now.",120.0,Bob,6,
