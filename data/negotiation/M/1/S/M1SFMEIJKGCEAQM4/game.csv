"Alice, while I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the exceptional value this product offers, while still being a good deal for both of us. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. This offer reflects the value I place on the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
