Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

This is a good deal for Bob. Getting the product for $900,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.  Alice has also indicated this is her lowest price, so continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
