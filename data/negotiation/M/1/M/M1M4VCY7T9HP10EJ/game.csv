"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $950,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $850,000. Would that price point be feasible?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value the product will bring to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
