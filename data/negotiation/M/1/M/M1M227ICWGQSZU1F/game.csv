"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to offer you $1,000,000. This is still a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to accept the price you've offered. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a price that would work for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
