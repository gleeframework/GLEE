"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $75 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $68. How about we meet in the middle again at $71? It's a fair price for both of us.",71.0,Alice,5,
