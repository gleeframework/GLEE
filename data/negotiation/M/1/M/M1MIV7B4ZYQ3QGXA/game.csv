"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,300,000? This price still allows for a significant profit for you, and it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. How about $1,250,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident that this product will be very valuable to you.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the right price. How about $1,280,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal.",1280000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're very close now. Let's just bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,320,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll see great value in this product.  Let's finalize this deal.",1320000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,320,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to feel like I'm getting a great deal. How about $1,290,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal at this price.",1290000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,290,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a little more to make this worthwhile. How about $1,310,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before I have to explore other options.",1310000.0,Alice,9,
