"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm pleased to offer it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  I begin the negotiation with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This tactic, known as anchoring, aims to set a high reference point in Bob's mind.
* **Justification:** I offer a reason for the high price, emphasizing ""true value and potential,"" without revealing specific details about my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Open for Discussion:** The tone is polite and professional, encouraging dialogue and feedback from Bob.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to gradually lower the price during subsequent rounds, gauging Bob's reactions and counteroffers. I'll carefully consider accepting his offers if they get close to $1,500,000 (my safety net with John). I'll always keep in mind the option of walking away and selling to John if the negotiation isn't progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still considerably below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but not at this price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true market value. To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,750,000.  This offer reflects the value and potential this product holds."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer ($250,000 decrease), signaling flexibility. However, I'm still significantly above Bob's offer and my safety net price.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm continuing to emphasize the value the product offers without being specific. This helps justify the higher price point. 
* **Maintaining Professionalism:** The tone remains respectful and collaborative, aiming for a win-win outcome.

**Strategy:**

I'm willing to make further concessions in smaller increments, testing Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price range. I'm mindful of not dropping the price too quickly, as it might signal desperation. I remain prepared to walk away if we can't reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with our goals. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my safety net price, the amount I'd get from selling to John.  There's no strategic advantage to rejecting this offer and risking further negotiation. Accepting ensures I receive the best possible outcome in this scenario."
