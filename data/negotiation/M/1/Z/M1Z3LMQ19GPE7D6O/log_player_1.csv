Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $100 to him and at least $80 to me.  It leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85.  While it's better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still ensures I earn a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
