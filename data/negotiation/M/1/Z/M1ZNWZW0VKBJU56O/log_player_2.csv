Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at the midpoint between $1,250,000 and $1,000,000, which is $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice's offer is getting closer to his budget, he only has 5 rounds left and it's unlikely she'll budge further. Buying from John guarantees him the product at his maximum budget and avoids further negotiation."
