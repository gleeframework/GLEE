Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a price that is:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He values it at $10,000, so I'm still leaving room for him to feel he's getting a good deal.
* **Lower than my minimum acceptable value:** My minimum is $15,000, but I'm willing to take a slight discount to secure a sale.

This strategy maximizes my chances of getting a sale from Bob while still ensuring I get a decent price. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for my full desired amount."
