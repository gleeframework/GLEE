Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $900,000 is more than Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This leaves room for you to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too far off from your minimum, suggesting you're serious about selling to Bob.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profits while keeping Bob interested.  By starting with a reasonable offer and leaving room for negotiation, you're setting the stage for a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to accept and close the deal, it's not a financially wise decision. 

By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Maintain your leverage:** You've shown you're not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Explore a counteroffer:** You can propose a price closer to your desired range, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Keep the option to sell to John:** You still have the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John if negotiations with Bob fail. 

A counteroffer gives you a better chance to achieve a higher sale price while avoiding a suboptimal deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to meet you halfway. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet halfway:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while remaining above your minimum.
* **Emphasize value:** You remind Bob of the product's true value, justifying your price.
* **Focus on fairness:**  The message emphasizes a mutually beneficial deal, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.

This counteroffer is a strategic move:

* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintains leverage:**  It's still above Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Keeps the option open:** You haven't closed the door on selling to John if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is now at your minimum acceptable price.  While you would ideally like to get closer to $1,000,000, accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation. 

Here's why this is the best decision:

* **Guaranteed profit:** You're securing a sale that meets your minimum profit requirement.
* **Minimizes risk:**  Continuing negotiation could lead to a deadlock, forcing you to sell to John at $1,000,000, which would be a missed opportunity to close the deal sooner.
* **Opportunity cost:** The time spent negotiating could be better used focusing on other opportunities.

It's important to recognize that sometimes it's better to settle for a slightly lower price than to risk losing the deal entirely."
