"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, I'm aiming for a lower price point.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a lower price point, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
