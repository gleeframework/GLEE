"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  This leaves room for negotiation if he rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low. While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm confident I can get more if I continue negotiating. I have room to negotiate and 8 more rounds to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still well above my minimum value. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept, while still leaving some room for further negotiation if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below what I'd ideally like, but I'm running out of time and rounds. It's  close to my minimum acceptable value, and I'm risking losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate. It's better to take the $9,500 now and secure the sale."
