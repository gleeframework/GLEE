"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than his ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to push for a lower price.  It's not worth taking the risk of buying from Alice at that price when John is offering it for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  It's a fair price considering the product, and it's closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can agree."", ""product_price"": 15500}
