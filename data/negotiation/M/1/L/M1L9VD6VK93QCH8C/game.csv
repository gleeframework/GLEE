"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it while staying within my financial limitations.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer represents a considerable compromise on my end while still reflecting the inherent worth of what's being offered.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product within my budget and you to get a good deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find common ground.  To move things along, I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant reduction on my end while still reflecting the product's inherent value.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  While $975,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm offering $950,000.  This offer represents a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's try to reach an agreement before we run out of time.",950000.0,Bob,6,
