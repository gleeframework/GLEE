"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it while staying within my financial limitations.  I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer represents a considerable compromise on my end while still reflecting the inherent worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product within my budget and you to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find common ground.  To move things along, I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant reduction on my end while still reflecting the product's inherent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his target. Bob has only 5 rounds left, so he needs to be strategic. Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal before he has to resort to buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  While $975,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm offering $950,000.

Let's try to reach an agreement before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 950000}
