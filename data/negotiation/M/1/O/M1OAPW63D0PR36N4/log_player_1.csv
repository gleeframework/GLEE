Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point, as it leaves some room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $130. This demonstrates flexibility while still leaving some room for further negotiation. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this compromise."
