"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm also aware that I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the offer.  I'm going to reject and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still a good amount higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully get a deal close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not satisfied with it yet. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, I'm willing to sell to Bob for this price. However, I still have the option of selling to John for the same amount if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is lower than my minimum, and with only a few rounds left, I'm not confident I can get him to go higher.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
