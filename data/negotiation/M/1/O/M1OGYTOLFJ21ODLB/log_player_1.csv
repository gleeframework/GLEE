Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we know Bob only values the product at $8,000,  we don't want to start too low. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more than his perceived value if he sees the product as highly beneficial.  By starting at $20,000:

* **We leave room for negotiation:** Bob is likely to counter-offer, and this gives us space to come down in price while still aiming for a figure significantly above $15,000.
* **We convey value:** A higher initial price can sometimes signal higher quality or desirability, potentially influencing Bob's perception.

It's important to remember: even if Bob rejects this initial offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John.  This knowledge empowers us to negotiate from a position of strength."
