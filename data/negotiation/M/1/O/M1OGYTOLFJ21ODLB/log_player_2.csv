"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to buy from John for $8,000."
