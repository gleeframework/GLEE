"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit for me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I'm still confident we can secure a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that is closer to my target.  I'll keep the option of selling to John open as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm going to drop my price to $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I won't settle for significantly less than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'll be prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a deal that doesn't meet my needs. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees me the minimum profit I need and saves me the time and energy of further negotiations."
