}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we are now at $1,090,000. This is a $90,000 profit over selling to John. It's unlikely Bob will drastically increase his offer further, and there's always the risk he walks away. Accepting at this point secures a strong profit."
