"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique and high-quality item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be willing to consider that price?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I can offer you a compromise at $115. It's a fair price, considering the product's value. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105?",105.0,Bob,6,

"I see you're getting closer to my minimum price, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's the lowest I can go. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $110 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, which is $107.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $107.50?",107.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"You're really trying to get a good deal, Bob! I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $107.50. I can offer you $108, which is still a bit higher than your previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you somewhere in the middle. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really trying to be reasonable here, but $108 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $105, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to sell it to me for $105, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $80.",105.0,Bob,10,
