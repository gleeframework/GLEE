Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This is a good starting point. It's below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, making it attractive to him. It also leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired profit margin.
* **The Message:**  It's friendly and casual, but also emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. It encourages him to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. How about $12,000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I believe I can get closer to my desired profit by continuing the negotiation.  

**Next Steps:** 

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $12,000 to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $13,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** My counteroffer of $13,000 is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer of $12,000 but lower than my initial offer of $14,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while also expressing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Next Steps:** By offering a middle ground, I hope to encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll re-evaluate my strategy and decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell the product to John."
