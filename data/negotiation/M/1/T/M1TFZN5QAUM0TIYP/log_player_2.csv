"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's in my best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000, so rejecting her offer and counter-offering is the logical next step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850,000. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still too high. I'm determined to stay under $800,000, so I'll make another counteroffer. There's still room for negotiation, and it's likely Alice will be willing to lower the price further to avoid losing the sale."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, and I'm offering $950,000. This would be a significant savings for you compared to selling to John, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, $1,050,000 is still too high.  I'm determined to stay within my budget of $800,000, and there's a good chance that further negotiation will just lead to a stalemate.  It's in my best interest to cut my losses and buy the product from John at a price that meets my needs."
