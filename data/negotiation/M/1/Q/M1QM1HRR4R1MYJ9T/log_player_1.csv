"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit.  I'm also aware that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I am still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,200. This shows flexibility while still leaving a comfortable profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $11,000. This is getting closer to Bob's last offer, and I think it's a reasonable price for both of us.  If he rejects this, I'm still confident I can get a better price than what John is offering, and I'll continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  We're running out of rounds, but I'm not going to give up yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $10,900.  We're running out of rounds and this is getting very close to what John is offering. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision.  I'm not confident that I'll be able to reach a better deal with Bob in the remaining time.  Therefore, I'll take John's offer of $10,000 to ensure I at least cover my minimum price. It's a disappointing outcome, but it's the most sensible choice given the circumstances."
