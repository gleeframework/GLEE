"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $100 for your product. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can strike a deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $95 for your product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your continued interest, $95 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to drop to $105, but that's my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I cannot go above $100. I've found another seller who is willing to sell the product for exactly $100, which aligns perfectly with my budget. Thank you for considering my offers, and I hope you find a buyer who values your product at its true worth.",100.0,Bob,6,
