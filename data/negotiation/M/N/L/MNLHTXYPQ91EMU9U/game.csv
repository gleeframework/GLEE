"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
