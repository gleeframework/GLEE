"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,150,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us,  $1,050,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you be willing to go down to $1,075,000?  It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's wrap this up. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,087,500? This ensures you get a great deal, and I receive a fair price for the value I'm providing.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
