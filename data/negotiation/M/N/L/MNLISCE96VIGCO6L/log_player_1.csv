Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than your minimum ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value for Bob. It also frames the price as fair.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price that is closer to your minimum, you maximize your potential profit.  If Bob rejects the offer, you can then adjust your price down slightly.  However, you always have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's tempting to accept $8,500, it's crucial to remember you have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price, or to fall back on John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $9,500 is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above his initial offer and above his perceived value. 
* **Message:**  The message remains friendly and reiterates the value proposition for Bob. It also frames the offer as a compromise to encourage acceptance.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still aiming to maximize profit. If Bob rejects this offer, you have more information to inform your next decision, whether to further adjust your price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $9,500. I'm still a bit hesitant, so I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $9,200. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,200 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your desired profit margin. You have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000, which makes it unnecessary to settle for a lower price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to potentially push for a higher price in the next round or fall back on John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $9,400, which is a fair price for both of us. This allows us to close the deal and save more time. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9400}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  This offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($9,200). 
* **Message:**  The message again emphasizes fairness and focuses on closing the deal efficiently.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin. If Bob rejects this offer, you'll be in a better position to decide whether to accept his final offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,200 to $9,400, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,350. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,350 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still not a price that significantly profits you.  Since you have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000, it's more beneficial to sell to John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob that might not result in a better offer."
