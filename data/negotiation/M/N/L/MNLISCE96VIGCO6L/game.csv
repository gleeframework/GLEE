"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $9,500. I'm still a bit hesitant, so I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $9,200. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $9,400, which is a fair price for both of us. This allows us to close the deal and save more time. What do you say?",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,200 to $9,400, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,350. Would you be willing to accept this price?",9350.0,Bob,6,
