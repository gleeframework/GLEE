"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable for you. My asking price is $1200000.  This reflects the unique value and potential of this product. I'm confident you'll find this offer compelling. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is higher than I'm comfortable spending. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. However, $900000 is below the value I've placed on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This reflects the unique value and potential of this product while remaining fair.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can try to negotiate further and see if he can get Alice to come down to a price closer to his target."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
