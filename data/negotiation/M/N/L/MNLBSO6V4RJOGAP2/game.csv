"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is higher than I'm comfortable spending. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $900000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. However, $900000 is below the value I've placed on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This reflects the unique value and potential of this product while remaining fair.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
