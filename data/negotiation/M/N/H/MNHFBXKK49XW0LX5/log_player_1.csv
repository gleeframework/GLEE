Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it allows room for negotiation. 
* **Assessing Bob:** I don't know Bob's valuation, so I'm starting high to gauge his interest and potential negotiation range. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I have a fallback if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer based on his perceived value and my desire to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting would result in a loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I have a guaranteed minimum if negotiations with Bob break down.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $15,000.  I'll carefully consider Bob's perceived value and willingness to negotiate when making my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Still Profit:**  I'm offering a price of $17,000, which is a compromise from my initial offer of $20,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps me above my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay a price closer to my valuation. If he accepts, I've secured a decent deal. 
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can still make another counteroffer, perhaps by lowering my price slightly to $16,000, depending on his response. 
* **John's Offer as a Backup:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me confidence in my negotiation strategy.

**Next Steps:**

I will closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make another offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum value of $15,000.  
* **Potential for More Negotiations:** While I'd prefer a higher price, further negotiation with Bob may not yield a significant increase. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob will walk away completely, leaving me with only John's offer of $15,000.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale. This outcome is favorable given the risk of further negotiation."
