{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($10,000) but still within the range of what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
