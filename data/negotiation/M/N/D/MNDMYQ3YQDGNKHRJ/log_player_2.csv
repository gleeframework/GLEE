{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. By offering $9,000, he's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget. This counteroffer is likely to be appealing to Alice, as it's still above her value of $8,000, but leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still a better deal than buying from John for $10,000. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject the counteroffer and ultimately end up with a worse deal.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price within his budget."
