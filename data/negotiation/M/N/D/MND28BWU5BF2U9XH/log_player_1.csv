""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's better to take John's guaranteed offer of $100.  Continuing negotiations with Bob might not lead to a better outcome, and I'd risk losing both offers."
