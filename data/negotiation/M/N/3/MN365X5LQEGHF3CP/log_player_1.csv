Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you some wiggle room to lower the price if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not an outrageous ask, and it leaves room for a mutually agreeable price.

I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This would still allow you to get a great deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750.

While $9,750 is tempting, I'm still determined to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to negotiate one more time with Bob, hoping to find a middle ground."
