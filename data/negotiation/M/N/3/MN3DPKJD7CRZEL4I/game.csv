"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? ",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value this product will bring you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
