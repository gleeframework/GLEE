"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it's still too high for you since you're aiming to spend no more than $1,500,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. While it's a decrease from her previous offer, you can likely still negotiate a lower price. You're aiming for a price under $1,000,000 and it's worth seeing if you can push for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value this product will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is closer to your target price of under $1,000,000.
*  While you might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price with more negotiation,  the risk is that Alice will walk away and you'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.
*  At this point, accepting the offer makes the most sense as it's a significant savings compared to buying from John and leaves room for a good profit margin."
