"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I've already factored in considerable potential for your success.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,950,000?  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I still think $1,950,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to consider $1,700,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price point, but we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for a price closer to $1,900,000, and with each round, we are getting closer to that goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle at $1,825,000? This reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business while recognizing your investment."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $1,825,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,675,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is definitely getting closer to a price we can work with. However, we're still aiming for above $1,750,000. We're getting into the later rounds, so it's time to start pushing a little harder for a better price, but we don't want to scare him off yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work for both of us. Let's settle this now.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can offer while still honoring the value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to lay down the law. We've been negotiating fairly, and we've reached a point that still yields a good profit. By stating this is our final offer, we're applying pressure without completely shutting down the negotiation if Bob wants to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,750,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, which is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to meet our lowest acceptable price. We stated $1,750,000 was our final offer, and his counter at $1,600,000 demonstrates he's not valuing the product at a level we find acceptable. It's now more beneficial to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob, especially with only two rounds remaining."
