"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $17000. This is a very good price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think, Bob?",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $17000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",16000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $16500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession. However, $16500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $16500. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering the product to you for $16500, and I'll include a free accessory that's worth $1000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",16500.0,Alice,9,
