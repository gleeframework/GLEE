"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to cover my costs.  Let's make this deal!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $105. That's the most I can stretch to at this point.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. $105 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? This is my final offer, and I really want to make this deal work.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to propose $105.50. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal.",105.5,Bob,6,
