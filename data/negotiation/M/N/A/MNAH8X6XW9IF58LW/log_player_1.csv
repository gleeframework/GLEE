This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum acceptable price.  This allows room for negotiation and potentially a win-win situation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a compromise."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'll need to be mindful of the risk of him walking away."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made several concessions.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a better deal with John.  I'll sell to John for $120."
