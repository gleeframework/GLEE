Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
