Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. While she has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, she can potentially get more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,200,000 or more to Bob is unlikely to succeed, as it's equal to or higher than his perceived value. 
* **Negotiating Room:** By starting at $1,150,000, Alice leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message uses language like ""exclusive opportunity"" to add a sense of urgency and value to encourage Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the highest possible price from Bob and ensuring the sale goes through, avoiding the need to sell to John at a lower profit."
