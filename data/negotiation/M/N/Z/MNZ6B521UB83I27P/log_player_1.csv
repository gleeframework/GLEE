Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a competitive price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives room for negotiation and avoids immediately rejecting the deal. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to him. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, showing flexibility.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer myself.
* If negotiations stall or become unproductive, I have the option to walk away and sell to John, guaranteeing my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm open to negotiation, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and attempt to close the gap. I can still potentially secure a higher price than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Risk vs. reward:** While selling to John guarantees my minimum, I'm willing to risk a bit more to see if I can reach a higher price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This represents a fair compromise that benefits us both. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** This counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer but below my minimum, keeping the negotiation moving.
* **Compromise language:** I emphasize ""fair compromise"" and ""benefits us both"" to encourage a sense of collaboration.
* **Closing the gap:**  The counteroffer brings us closer to a potential agreement, increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Positive tone:**  I continue using a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain rapport.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer. 
* If negotiations become unproductive, I'll still have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,062,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both place on this product. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:**  Bob's counteroffer of $1,062,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Limited negotiation room:** Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Guaranteeing my minimum:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees my desired minimum profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might result in a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed with the sale to John, ensuring a profitable outcome."
