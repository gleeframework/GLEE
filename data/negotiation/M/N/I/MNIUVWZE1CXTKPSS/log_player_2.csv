{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500. That's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Alice is very unlikely to go below $8,000. It's better to secure the deal with John for $8,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
