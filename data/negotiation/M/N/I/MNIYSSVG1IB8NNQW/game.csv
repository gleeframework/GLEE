"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $500,000.  What do you say?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a ways off from that number. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? That's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $700,000 is still too far off.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to finalize this.",850000.0,Alice,5,
