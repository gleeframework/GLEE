"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my valuation. How about $850000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1050000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your proposed price.

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $1025000 reflects the product's true value.

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1050000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $1080000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1080000.0,Alice,9,
