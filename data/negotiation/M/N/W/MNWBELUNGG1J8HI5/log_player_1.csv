"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000, reflecting the significant value this product will bring to your business. This price still allows you to make a substantial profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
