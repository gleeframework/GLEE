Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is far too low.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a substantial discount from my initial price, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession, and it's really the lowest I can go.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000.  You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, saving you $50,000. It's time to cut your losses with Alice and take the guaranteed deal."
