Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is far too low.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a substantial discount from my initial price, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want to be. I'm going to try and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession, and it's really the lowest I can go.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
