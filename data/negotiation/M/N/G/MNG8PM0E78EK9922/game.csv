"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe the value this product brings to your operations is significantly higher than $900,000.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,025,000? This reflects the unique value proposition while recognizing your initial feedback.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm thinking more like $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
