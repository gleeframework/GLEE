Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description] that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've started with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I've kept the message brief and focused on the value of the product. This is designed to pique Bob's interest without revealing too much about my own valuation.

This approach aims to:

* **Start high:** To maximize potential profit.
* **Be open to negotiation:**  To signal flexibility and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Keep the message short and informative:**  To quickly get to the negotiation stage.

Remember, this is just the first offer. We'll need to adjust our strategy based on Bob's response and his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum value:** Accepting his offer means I won't lose any money and I'll avoid the risk of further negotiation.
* **Time is valuable:**  Further negotiations might drag on, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob.
* **No gain, no pain:**  While I'd love to get more,  selling to Bob for $8,000 is a reasonable outcome considering my minimum value. 

This strategy prioritizes securing a guaranteed sale at my minimum value, avoiding potential delays and risks associated with further negotiation."
