Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible, even though Bob values it less. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $11,500 is a strong offer that still leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal compared to the implied market value.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays of finding another buyer, even if John is guaranteed."
