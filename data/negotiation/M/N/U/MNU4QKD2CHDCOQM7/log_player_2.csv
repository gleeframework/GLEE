"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. $500,000 is a great price, but you have room to negotiate and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $300,000 is a bold move, but it's a good starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$400,000 is still a good price, but we can likely get it lower. I want to see if Alice is willing to budge further before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial counteroffer. This gives Alice some room to accept without feeling like she's conceding too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$450,000 is still a good price, but I'm not ready to commit yet. We're getting closer to a deal, but I want to see if Alice will come down further before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, meeting Alice halfway to show that I'm serious about closing the deal.  This is a good compromise point, and I'm hoping she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is back to her initial offer.  While it's a good price, we're nearing the end of the negotiation and I still believe we can get a better deal.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $425,000. This is a final attempt to meet Alice halfway and close the deal before we run out of time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation and Alice is increasing her price.  It's not worth risking another counteroffer at this point.  Buying from John for $1,500,000 is still a much better deal than accepting Alice's offer."
