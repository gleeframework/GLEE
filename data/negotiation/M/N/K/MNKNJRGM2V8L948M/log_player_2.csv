"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. However, you know John will sell it to you for $1,500,000.  
* There's a chance you can get Alice to lower her price further. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you are looking for a better deal.

**Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, you might encourage Alice to propose a counter-offer closer to her product's value of $1,200,000."
