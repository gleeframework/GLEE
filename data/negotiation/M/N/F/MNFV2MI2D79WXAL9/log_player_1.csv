{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it.  I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price.  This should make the offer appealing while also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $120. Would you be willing to do $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject his counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to stay closer to my budget. How about $132? I'm serious about buying this, but I can't go much higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer to my minimum.  Since I'm not sure if I can get a better offer, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $132."
