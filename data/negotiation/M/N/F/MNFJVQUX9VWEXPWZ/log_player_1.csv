Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $800,000.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above my minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and my belief in a fair deal."
