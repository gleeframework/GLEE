Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000.  This is a bit higher than Bob's value for the product, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I also have John as a backup option to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. While $12,000 is my minimum price, I'm not eager to settle for that just yet.  I'm going to try to get closer to my initial price of $13,000.  I have John as a backup, so I'm not under too much pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with a price of $12,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer, but if he doesn't, I'll be prepared to negotiate further or sell to John as a last resort."
