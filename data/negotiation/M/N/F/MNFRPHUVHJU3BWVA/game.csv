"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm aiming to stay below $1,300,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than you're offering. Considering your willingness to compromise, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
