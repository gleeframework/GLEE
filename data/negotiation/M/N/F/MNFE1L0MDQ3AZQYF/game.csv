"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $650000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider my offer?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $650000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and my initial offer of $750000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $700000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $700000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $675000. Can you consider this offer?",675000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit away from your offer of $675000. Considering the product's value and my initial offer of $750000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering it to you for $725000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit away from your offer of $725000. I'm willing to go up to $700000, but no higher. Can you consider this offer?",700000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with your offer of $700000. Considering the product's value and my initial offer of $750000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering it to you for $720000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",720000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700000 and $720000, which is $710000. Can you consider this offer?",710000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $710000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not comfortable going any lower. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $715000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",715000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm not willing to pay $715000. I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I'll consider other options, including buying from John for $800000.",0.0,Bob,10,
