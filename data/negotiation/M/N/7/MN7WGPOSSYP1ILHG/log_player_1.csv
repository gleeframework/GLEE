"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm looking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price above your minimum. This allows room for potential compromise if Bob finds the price too high. It also includes a friendly message to start the conversation on a positive note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below your minimum desired price. You're still early in the negotiation, and you have room to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $120? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this from you, but my absolute max is $90.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is still below your minimum desired price of $150. You're approaching the midpoint of the negotiation, but you can still try to secure a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we settle on $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you being flexible.  $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we split the difference and settle on $97.50?  That would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $97.5 is close to your minimum, you still have a few rounds left and can aim for a price closer to your desired $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $97.50 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about we settle on $101.25? This feels like a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 101.25}
```"
