"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm looking for $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $120? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this from you, but my absolute max is $90.  Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we settle on $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. ",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you being flexible.  $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we split the difference and settle on $97.50?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",97.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $97.50 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about we settle on $101.25? This feels like a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",101.25,Alice,7,
