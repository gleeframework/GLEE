I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I understand he's trying to negotiate, $11,500 is too low for me. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob's offer is my minimum, and John is willing to pay that amount. It's not ideal, but it's a safe bet to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale."
