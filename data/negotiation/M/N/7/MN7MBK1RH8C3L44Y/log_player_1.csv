Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I believe it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think I can agree on $150 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the maximum he's willing to pay and it's still below my minimum. It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
