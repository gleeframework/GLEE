"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While this product offers immense value, I'm willing to meet you closer to your budget. How about we settle at $1,275,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,275,000 is closer, but still a little high for me.  How about $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're still significantly above John's offer, and I believe Bob is willing to go higher. It's worth risking another round to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly see the value in this product, and I'm keen to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  Let's settle this at $1,210,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1210000
}
``` 

By Round 5, it's strategic to apply a bit more pressure.  By stating it's my final offer, I aim to incentivize Bob to accept without dragging negotiations out much longer.  This price is still a great return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer you $1,175,000. I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I stated my previous offer was final to encourage a deal, accepting $1,175,000 is a wise move at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** We're still making a $175,000 profit over John's standing offer.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Further negotiation could push Bob away, risking the deal altogether. 
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows us to move on to other opportunities."
