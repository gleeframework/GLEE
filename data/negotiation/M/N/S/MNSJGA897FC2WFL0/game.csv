"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I see the value in this product, but $1,150,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900,000. This offer represents a fair price considering my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, the $900,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This offer signifies a considerable compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's worth.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
