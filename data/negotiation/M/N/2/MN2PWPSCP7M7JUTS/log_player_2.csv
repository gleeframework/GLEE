"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  $900,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to signal my seriousness about getting a good deal while leaving room for negotiation.  $800,000 is still a substantial amount, but it's a good starting point for bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to a price I'm comfortable with. While I'd prefer to continue negotiating, the risk of her walking away or me losing time is too high.  $850,000 is a good deal, and it's better than paying John $1,000,000."
