"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000.  This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,450,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, at $1,525,000. This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
