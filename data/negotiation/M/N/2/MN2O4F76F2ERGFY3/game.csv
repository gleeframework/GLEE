,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $140?  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go up to $140, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $120 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $130.  It's a fair price, and it would allow us both to get a good outcome.  What do you say?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not sure about $130. How about we try $110? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",110.0,Bob,6,
