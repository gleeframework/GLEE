"I'm interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I'm willing to pay that amount for this product, but I think it's a bit too high. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I can make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far away from my minimum acceptable price.

"Bob, I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far away from my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go any lower than $9000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and the market price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm offering it to you for $9250.

I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm offering $8750. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept it, I'll buy the product from you.
