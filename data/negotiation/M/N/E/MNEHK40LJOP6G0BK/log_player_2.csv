# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?
