"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your operations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,600,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and  $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and would allow us both to close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
