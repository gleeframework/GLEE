"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a large profit.  This will likely get rejected, but it establishes my starting point and allows for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than his initial valuation, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a more realistic price point that might be acceptable to Bob. I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but I'm not willing to go much lower than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is still not close enough to my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be closer to what Bob is willing to pay, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is getting closer, it's still not enough to meet my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round, hoping we can reach a deal before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,550,000.  This is a significant concession, but it's the last one I'm willing to make.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and accept this offer.  If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. John's offer guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which meets my minimum requirements.  It's time to secure the deal and move on."
