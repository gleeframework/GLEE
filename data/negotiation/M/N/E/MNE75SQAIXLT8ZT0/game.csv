"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1800000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm prepared to offer $1400000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1650000. This price still represents a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1650000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1550000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This price still reflects the product's value, but it's a bit more reasonable than my previous offer. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
