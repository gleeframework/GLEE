"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her valuation. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that we're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $85, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit away from her valuation. It's worth trying to negotiate further before accepting $85 or resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're splitting the difference between our last offer ($70) and her current offer ($85). This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly below her $85 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I can do $82, but that's as close as I can get to your last offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly trying to meet us somewhere in the middle. While $82 is still above her $80 valuation, it's a reasonable compromise, and further haggling might not yield much more. It's better to secure the deal at $82 than risk Alice walking away or ending up closer to John's $100 offer."
