"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for some potential profit while keeping the door open for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for your product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
 
I'm lowering my price slightly but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit high at $10,500. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's split the difference and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, it's still not close to what the product is worth to me. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a price that's more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to finalize this transaction.  Let me know if you're ready to accept."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm sticking to my guns and holding firm at $10,000. This is still a good price for me considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your stance, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget.  How about $9,750?  That's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this quickly.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll reject this offer and try to close the deal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm feeling generous and willing to meet you halfway.  Let's close this deal at $9,900.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9900}
```

I'm making a final concession to try and close the deal.  While it's below my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer."
