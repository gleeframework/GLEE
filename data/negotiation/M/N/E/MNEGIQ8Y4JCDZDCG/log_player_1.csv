"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the maximum Bob is willing to pay, giving me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A $1,000 difference allows for some back and forth without jeopardizing my minimum desired price.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and be open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $11,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I can still potentially get a better price from Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more agreeable price.
* **John is a Backup:**  While I'd prefer a higher price from Bob, knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** My message highlights that a deal at this price is beneficial to both of us. 
* **Urgency Implied:** The phrase ""Let's make this happen"" subtly implies that I'm open to a deal but not willing to wait indefinitely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise, and it's above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer and we'll end up at a lower price.
* **Time is of the Essence:** We're already in round 4, and there are only 6 rounds left. Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids further negotiation risk."
