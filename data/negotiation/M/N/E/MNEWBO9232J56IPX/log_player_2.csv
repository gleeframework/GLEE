"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price, especially since you have a backup option with John.  Let's see if we can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to start by offering $120. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, and it gives us some room to negotiate. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to increase my offer slightly in the next round, but I want to see if we can close the deal quickly at a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $135, which is a fair price considering my initial offer of $120.  It's still within my budget, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  Let's accept the offer and move on."
