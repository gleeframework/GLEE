Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a good profit. 
* **The message is friendly and professional.** It acknowledges Bob's perspective and invites him to engage in the negotiation. 

I chose to offer a price close to my minimum acceptable price, as there is a high risk that Bob might reject the offer.  If he does, I can make a counteroffer and still potentially get a good price. Alternatively, I can always turn to John and sell the product for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $950,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer and secure a quick sale, I'm not willing to compromise that much.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. This price still leaves me with a fair profit, while also being within your range.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000** is a compromise price, higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **The message is firm but polite.** It acknowledges Bob's constraints while reiterating my stance. I state this is my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 

I am now closer to Bob's budget but still above my minimum acceptable price, giving me more leverage in this round.  If he rejects this offer, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring a much larger profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering your last offer, I would like to propose $1,000,000 as a compromise. It's higher than my initial budget, but still within my financial limits. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm not willing to settle for a price that low, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  While I value our ongoing negotiations, $1,000,000 is still too far from my desired price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a final compromise to ensure a fair deal for both of us.  Please let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000** is a middle ground between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates further flexibility while still keeping the price above my absolute minimum. 
* **The message highlights the compromise and finality.** By stating it's a ""final compromise"", I create pressure to accept the offer and prevent further negotiation. 

This counteroffer is a calculated risk. While I'm closer to Bob's budget, I'm still not at my ideal price. If he rejects, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, but I'm hoping to close this deal with Bob for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Given the circumstances, I would like to propose $1,025,000 as a counteroffer. It's a step towards meeting your desired price while still keeping it within my budget. I hope this can lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to justify the risk of further negotiation. We've gone through multiple rounds, and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my desired price.  

Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,500,000, it's in my best interest to stop the negotiation with Bob and sell to John.  This guarantees a significantly higher profit, minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potentially lower prices."
