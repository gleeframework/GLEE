"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $20000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $10000. Let me make you a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $17000. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $17000 is still a bit outside my price range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $17000 and $13500, which would be $15000. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your efforts, $15000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",14000.0,Bob,6,
