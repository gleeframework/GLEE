"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $1350000?
