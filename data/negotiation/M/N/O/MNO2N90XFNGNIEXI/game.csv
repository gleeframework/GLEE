"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $9,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about $7,000? That's a fair offer considering its true value.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $8,250?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I could do $7,500, but that's my final offer.",7500.0,Bob,6,
