Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is the price John is offering. Can you meet me halfway?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  $1,250,000 is a bit low for me, but to show I'm flexible, how about we settle at $1,300,000? This seems like a fair compromise."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000 for the product. Can you consider that?

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,275,000 is a good deal. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of continued negotiation potentially leading to a worse outcome or losing the deal altogether."
