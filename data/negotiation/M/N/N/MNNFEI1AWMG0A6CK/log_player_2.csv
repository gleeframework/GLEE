"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.** You're willing to spend $10,000, and Alice is asking for $11,000. 
* **There are more rounds to negotiate.** It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer below Alice's price:**  This shows you're serious about buying, but you're also trying to secure a better deal.
* **Reasonable starting point:** A $1,500 drop from Alice's initial offer is significant but not unreasonable. This leaves room for negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $10,500 is within your $10,000 limit.
* **Negotiating further might be risky:**  While you could try to get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you might end up paying more than $10,500 in later rounds.
* **It's a good deal:** You're getting the product for $500 less than John's offer, and you've saved time and effort compared to continuing the negotiation."
