Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation to give myself some room to negotiate.  I'm hoping he'll counter, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially secure a higher price. If he rejects this initial offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my initial asking price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. This is still a little above Bob's last offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John to avoid losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is only $50,000 less than my initial offer.  While I'd like to continue negotiating, the risk of another rejection and then having to sell to John for a lower price isn't worth it.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a sale for $1,650,000."
