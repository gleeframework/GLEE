Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $925,000. I know this product is incredibly valuable to you, and this offer allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy for $800,000 provides a strong fallback position.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale."
