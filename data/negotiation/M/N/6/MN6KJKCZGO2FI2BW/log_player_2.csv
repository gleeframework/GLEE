Alice's offer is too high. It's worth going through the negotiation process to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $13,000? I think it's a fair price considering the value I'm getting out of the deal.

While $13,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still above my limit. I'll try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. How about I include a free warranty and some additional support services, and we meet at $13,000? It's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

While the added warranty and support are appealing, it's not enough to make up for the extra $3,000.  At this point, it's clear that Alice isn't willing to come down to my desired price, so it's best to move on and buy from John for the guaranteed $10,000."
