"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $22,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000.  I think that's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $18,000.  This reflects the value it would bring you."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $12,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is closer, but it's still a substantial difference from what I need to make this work.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground here.  How about we try $13,000?  That's me moving closer to your last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason: While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, continuing the negotiation has a lower expected payoff than taking John's guaranteed offer."
