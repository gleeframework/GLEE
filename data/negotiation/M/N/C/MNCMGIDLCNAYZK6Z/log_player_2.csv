# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is higher than John's offer of $12,000.  Since your goal is to save money and you're willing to buy from John at $12,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John."
