"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much better to try negotiating a lower price or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's asking price and even less than our maximum budget. Starting with a low counter-offer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely to maintain a good negotiating relationship. We're not outright rejecting her offer but expressing our budget limitations. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer puts the ball back in Alice's court.  It will be interesting to see if she's willing to go this low or if she counters with a price closer to our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $85. I can do a bit better than that. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $110 is still above both our target price and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation. We'll try to nudge her closer to $100 without being too aggressive yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm trying to keep my spending under control.  Could you do $95? That would work for me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, but still well below her current offer. This shows willingness to negotiate but also holds firm on our budget.
* **Justification:**  Giving a reason like ""keeping spending under control"" reinforces that we have budget constraints.
* **Direct and Clear:**  We're directly stating a price that works for us, making it easier for Alice to understand our position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer, Bob! I can see we're making progress. I can meet you halfway between $95 and $110, so how about $102.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting very close to our budget, but we have a guaranteed option with John for $100.  While we might be able to squeeze a few more dollars off Alice's price, it's not worth the risk of her withdrawing the offer entirely.  At this point, the $2.50 difference isn't significant enough to justify further negotiation.  We'll take the sure thing and buy from John."
