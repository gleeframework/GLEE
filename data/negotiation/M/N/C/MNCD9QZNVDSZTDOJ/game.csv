"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer you $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential we both see in this deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value you place on the product, while also allowing me to earn a reasonable profit.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $9,000. This is a significant step towards your offer, and I believe it demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're serious about acquiring the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000, so I'll counteroffer $9,500. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",9500.0,Alice,5,
