Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer:

* **Starts high:**  It's closer to Bob's perceived value, giving me more room for negotiation.
* **Sounds reasonable:**  It's not a ridiculous number, making it more likely Bob will at least consider it. 
* **Highlights the benefit to Bob:**  This helps him see the value proposition. 

I'll be ready to adjust the price if Bob counteroffers, but I'm aiming to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. Remember, I always have the option of selling to John for $800,000 if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I want to try and squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'm confident I can get closer to my target. It's worth risking another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $912,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, I'm getting close to my goal of $950,000.  $912,500 is a good deal, and accepting Bob's offer guarantees the sale. While I could try to push for another round of negotiation, there's always a chance that Bob will walk away entirely.  It's better to secure the sale now and get the best possible price."
