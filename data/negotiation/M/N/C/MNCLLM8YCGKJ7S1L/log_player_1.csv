{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's high enough to potentially give Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving significant profit for me. I'm also being transparent about my reasoning for the price. This can help build trust and encourage Bob to be more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for both of us, as it allows me to buy the product and you still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with him.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. How about $1,350,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and allows me to make a fair return on the product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'd prefer to get more, it's a good deal for both of us. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale entirely and having to sell to John for less."
