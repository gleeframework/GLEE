"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for both of us, as it allows me to buy the product and you still make a profit.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. How about $1,350,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and allows me to make a fair return on the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
