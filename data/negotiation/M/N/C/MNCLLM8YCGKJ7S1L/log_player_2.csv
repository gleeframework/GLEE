"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. How about $1,350,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and allows me to make a fair return on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $1,350,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a price closer to his last counteroffer of $1,200,000."
