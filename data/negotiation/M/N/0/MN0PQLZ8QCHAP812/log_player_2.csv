"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $6,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive, but it's still above your target price of $8,000.**
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and get a better price.**  

By rejecting the offer, you can start the counter-offer process and potentially get a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product,  $6,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $5,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your intent to negotiate seriously.
* **Reasonable Justification:** You provide a reason for your counteroffer, tying it to your budget constraints.
* **Opening the Door for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer sets the stage for a back-and-forth, giving Alice the opportunity to counter your offer or potentially find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $5,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $6,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's compromise:**  Alice has moved closer to your desired price.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While $6,000 is above your target,  you've already achieved a significant reduction from the initial price.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to reject offers could lead to Alice becoming less willing to negotiate, or you might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.

**In this round, it's a good idea to accept the offer and secure the product. You can always try to negotiate a lower price later if possible, but accepting now provides certainty and a good starting point for future discussions.**"
