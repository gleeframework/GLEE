,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000 to make this deal work. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm still not able to go above $11,000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to meet you halfway and offer $12,500 for the product.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let's close this deal and move on!",12500.0,Alice,5,
