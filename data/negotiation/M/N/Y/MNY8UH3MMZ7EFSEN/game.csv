"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is closer to the true value of what this product offers you. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go as low as $11,000.  How about we settle at $11,750? This feels like a fair compromise.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,750 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's finalize the deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
