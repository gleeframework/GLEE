{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""unique value,""  you create the impression that the product is worth a premium.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** While starting high, it's crucial to signal that you're willing to negotiate. This encourages Bob to engage in the conversation rather than walking away immediately.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you have John as a backup, you don't want to reveal this to Bob.  Knowing about a guaranteed sale could weaken your negotiating position.

**Important Note:**  Even though Bob only values the product at $8,000, there might be room to negotiate a price above that, especially if he perceives the product as having specific benefits or scarcity."
