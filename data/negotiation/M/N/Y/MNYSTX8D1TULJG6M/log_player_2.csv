(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. Rejecting the initial offer opens the opportunity for counteroffers and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $9,500 is a bold move, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness in getting a good deal while also testing Alice's willingness to compromise."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially do better. He has already established that he's willing to negotiate and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to push for a price closer to his ideal $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price.  By offering $10,000, he is demonstrating his commitment to closing the deal while still leaving room for Alice to make a small concession. This counteroffer is a strong move, showcasing Bob's willingness to negotiate but also his determination to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,600, which is a good price for Bob considering his target price of $9,500.  He's already invested several rounds in negotiation and there's no guarantee he can get a better deal.  Accepting this offer ensures he gets the product at a good price without risking further negotiation that might lead to a higher price or even a breakdown in the deal."
