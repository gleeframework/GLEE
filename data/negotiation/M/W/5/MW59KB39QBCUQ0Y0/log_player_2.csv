"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and proceeding to the next round to counteroffer is the most logical choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer and counteroffering again allows Bob to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still looking to stay within my budget, though. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $13,000? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's budget. While there's a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price, it's becoming risky to continue with Alice. With only 5 rounds left, the possibility of not reaching an agreement increases. Buying from John guarantees a purchase at Bob's maximum budget and avoids further negotiation."
