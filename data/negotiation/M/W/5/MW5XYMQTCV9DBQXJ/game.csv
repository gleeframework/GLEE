"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,050,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's meet in the middle!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet at $950,000? This is a bit closer to my target, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
