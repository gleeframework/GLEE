Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,050,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet at $950,000? This is a bit closer to my target, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet at $980,000? This is a good price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and while he's getting closer to my desired price, I'm not convinced I can get him to agree to $1,000,000.  With John offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, it's the most logical decision to sell to John and avoid the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
