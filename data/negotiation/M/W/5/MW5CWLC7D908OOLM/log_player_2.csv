"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate downwards towards our goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to buy significantly lower than Alice's asking price.  Starting with a low counter-offer gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is respectful but clearly states our price target. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $650,000, we signal that we're serious but are open to moving towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $975,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved down considerably, $975,000 is still significantly higher than both our target price and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests we might be able to reach a more agreeable price.

We need to continue negotiating to bridge the gap and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $975,000 is a bigger stretch than I can make. I could go up to $725,000, but that's really my limit."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement (Slightly):** We need to show Alice we're willing to move from our initial offer, but we're doing so incrementally. 
* **Setting a Firm Limit:** Stating ""really my limit"" emphasizes that we're serious and less likely to budge much beyond this point.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  We're still a significant distance from Alice's price, keeping the pressure on her to lower her expectations if she wants to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about we meet halfway at $850,000? This reflects the product's worth while recognizing your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:**  Alice is now suggesting a price that's within our acceptable range (below $800,000). 
* **Slight Edge:** However, she's suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between our last offer and her previous one. This indicates there might be a bit more room for her to move. 
* **John's Offer:**  We have a very competitive fallback option with John's offer of $800,000. 

We'll reject this offer and try to nudge Alice a bit closer to our ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  I could potentially do $775,000, but that's really pushing it for me."",
""product_price"": 775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Positioning:** We're moving closer to John's price, putting slight pressure on Alice.
* **Small Increment:** The small increase shows our willingness to negotiate, but we're not giving up much ground.
* **Firm Language:** The phrase ""really pushing it"" reinforces our position that this is our upper limit. 

By now, Alice should see we're serious and have an alternative. This offer aims to secure the best possible price while leaving minimal room for further negotiation."
