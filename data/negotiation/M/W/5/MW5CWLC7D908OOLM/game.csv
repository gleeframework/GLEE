,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $975,000.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $975,000 is a bigger stretch than I can make. I could go up to $725,000, but that's really my limit.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about we meet halfway at $850,000? This reflects the product's worth while recognizing your budget considerations.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  I could potentially do $775,000, but that's really pushing it for me.",775000.0,Bob,6,
