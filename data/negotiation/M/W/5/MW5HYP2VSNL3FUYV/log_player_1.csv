Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but still below my minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, making the negotiation process smoother. 

This strategy balances maximizing my potential profit with keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's closer to my desired range, I'm not willing to sell for less than $120 unless I have no other options. 
* **I want to see if I can push for a higher price.**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $115?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but still keeping the price above Bob's offer.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to pay a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation open and avoids a breakdown.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is firm on his price.**  He's twice rejected my offers, demonstrating his unwillingness to go higher.
* **John offers a significantly better deal.**  Selling to John guarantees me $120, which meets my minimum requirement and is substantially better than Bob's final offer.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I'm prioritizing maximizing my profit.  It's more advantageous to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed sale at a price I'm happy with."
