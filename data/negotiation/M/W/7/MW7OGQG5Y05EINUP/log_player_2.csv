Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go below $90. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?

It's time to cut bait. Alice is very unlikely to go below $90, and you have a guaranteed option at $80.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate when you can get a better deal elsewhere."
