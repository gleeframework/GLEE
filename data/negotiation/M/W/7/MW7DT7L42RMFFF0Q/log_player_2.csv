"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'd like to reject the offer. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still too high for me.
