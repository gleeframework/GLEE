I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential for a win-win scenario. I believe Bob is willing to pay more than $8,000 since the product is worth $15,000 to him.  If he rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, always keeping in mind my minimum price and the possibility of selling to John for $8,000."
