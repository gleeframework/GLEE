Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting point. Here's why I chose this price and how I'll approach the negotiation:

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  
    * **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good price.
    * **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer. If it's too low, I'll make a new counteroffer, trying to close the gap. 
    * **If Bob's counteroffers are too low:** I'll use the threat of selling to John ($1,200,000) as leverage.  This will hopefully push Bob to make a more serious offer. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for $600,000. I'll counteroffer and try to push him closer to my desired price.  

Let's see if I can get closer to $1,000,000 with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Maintains a strong position:** It's still above Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Shows willingness to negotiate:**  It's a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing that I'm open to compromise.
* **Targets a realistic compromise:**  $850,000 is closer to my ideal price but still leaves some room for further negotiation if needed. 

The message is friendly and emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario, aiming to keep Bob engaged and open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate you coming down.  However, I'm on a tight budget, and $850,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? It's a significant investment on my part and bridges the gap between our valuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below where I want to be. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming to push him higher.  

Let's see if I can bridge the gap a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate you trying to find a solution.  $700,000 is still a bit too low for me to be comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $750,000. This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the value of this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

Here's why I chose this counteroffer:

* **Bridge the Gap:** $750,000 is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last one, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Maintain Leverage:** It's still above Bob's last offer, reminding him that I'm not desperate and have other options.
* **Emphasis on ""Fairness"":** I'm framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 

By focusing on compromise and fairness, I'm aiming to keep the negotiation positive and increase the chances of Bob accepting this counteroffer."
