Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great price for you and gives me a reasonable profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than your target price of $80. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $90, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $92.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You should buy the product from John.  Alice is not willing to go below $92.50, which is still above your target price of $80. It's better to secure the product from John at your desired price."
