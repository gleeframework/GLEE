Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** Starting with a price of $1,300,000 sets a high anchor point. While it's still significantly lower than John's offer, it leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Highlighting Value, Not Just Price:** The message focuses on the ""unique value and potential"" of the product rather than just the price.  This encourages Bob to consider the product's benefits beyond just the dollar amount.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity,"" the message subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering a price Bob might find acceptable, considering the product is worth $800,000 to him."
