Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than your $80 minimum. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $80 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed a decent profit."
