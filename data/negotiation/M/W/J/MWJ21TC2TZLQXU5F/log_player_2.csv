"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price.  Buying from John is always an option, but Bob should try to exhaust the negotiation with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but he needs to be realistic. This counteroffer is a large jump from Alice's initial price, but it's still a significant amount lower than her valuation. This counteroffer allows for some room to negotiate in subsequent rounds without appearing too unreasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue to try to get a better deal. Buying from John is always an option, but Bob should see if he can squeeze out a slightly better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1060000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, but she's also firm on her price. A counteroffer of $1,060,000 represents a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's most recent one.  This is a smaller jump than before, demonstrating that Bob is serious about closing the deal while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would prefer to pay less, Alice's offer is only $70,000 above Bob's maximum. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John. At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most pragmatic choice, minimizing risk and securing the product without exceeding Bob's budget significantly."
