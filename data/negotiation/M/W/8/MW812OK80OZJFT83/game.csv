"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to me, at least $1,000,000, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the potential value you see in it. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit high for me. Considering the value to you, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows you to recoup most of your investment, while still saving me a significant amount. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, it falls short of my minimum value for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which represents a significant concession on my end. This offer still allows you to gain significant value, and it's a price that I can comfortably accept. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
