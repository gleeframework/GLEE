Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, it falls short of my minimum value for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which represents a significant concession on my end. This offer still allows you to gain significant value, and it's a price that I can comfortably accept. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.
