Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I know Bob values the product at $80, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum price that it's worthwhile to accept. Continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer and having to sell to John at a lower profit."
