Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100:** This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  It's friendly and highlights the product's value to encourage Bob's interest.

**Strategy:** 

I'm starting with a higher price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further.  However, I have the safety net of selling to John for $80 if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I would have preferred to get more, accepting his offer is the most sensible option.  This avoids the risk of further negotiation and ensures a quick sale."
