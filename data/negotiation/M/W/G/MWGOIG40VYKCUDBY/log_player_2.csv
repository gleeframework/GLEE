# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000. Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than your maximum but you can still get a better deal. You can reject her offer and buy from John for $1,000,000, which is your maximum."
