Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000 vs. $8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number. I'm framing it as an ""opportunity"" and highlighting the ""significant value"" to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I know John is willing to buy the product for $8,000, which serves as my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can negotiate down, but I won't go below my safety net."
