"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, and it also sets a high baseline for the value of the product.  I'm confident in the value of my product, and I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm setting my counteroffer at $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price. I want to make it clear that I'm serious about getting a fair deal for my product.  I believe Bob will see the value in my product, and will be willing to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. It's only $100,000 above my guaranteed price from John. I'll reject this offer and see if I can squeeze out a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000.  This is a compromise, but it's still a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to close the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to go higher than $1,100,000. I've already had two rounds where he offered this price, and it seems like he's dug in his heels. It's not worth risking more rounds to try and squeeze out another $50,000, especially when I have a guaranteed sale for $1,200,000 from John. I'm going to sell the product to John and be done with it."
