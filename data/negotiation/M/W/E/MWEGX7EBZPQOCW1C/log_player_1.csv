Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $19,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its benefits to you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum potential:** Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's potential to sell it for significantly more than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high initial offer ($19,000) sets an anchor point for the negotiation. While it's above Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for potential counter-offers.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000. This gives you leverage and allows you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial constraints. Gathering more information about Bob could lead to a more tailored and potentially more effective approach."
