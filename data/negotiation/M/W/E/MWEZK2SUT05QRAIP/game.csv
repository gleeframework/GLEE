"Alice,  $20,000 is well above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, however $20,000 is closer to the value I have in mind.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really hoping to finalize this purchase, so how about we settle on $14,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
