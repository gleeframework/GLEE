"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $130? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about $135?  It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $132.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",132.5,Bob,4,
