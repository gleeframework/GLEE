Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price slightly below Bob's valuation allows room for negotiation if he tries to haggle. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other potential buyers (even though John would pay less) adds a sense of urgency and competition.

This strategy seeks the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to accept, avoiding the need to sell to John for the lower price."
