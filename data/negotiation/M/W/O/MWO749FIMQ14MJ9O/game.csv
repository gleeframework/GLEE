"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $100 by you. Considering its quality and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth more. I am proposing to sell it to you for $120. This price reflects its true value while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",120.0,Alice,1,
