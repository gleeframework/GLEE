**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly motivated to sell and has consistently lowered her price.  At $800,000, we're getting a significant discount from both her initial offer and John's price. While we might be able to push her a little further, the potential savings are likely minimal compared to the risk of her walking away from the deal.  This price represents a good balance of savings and deal certainty."
