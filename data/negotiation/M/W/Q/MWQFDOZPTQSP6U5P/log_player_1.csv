"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is below Bob's perceived value but still gives me a good profit.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making my offer seem more attractive. 

**Strategy:** I'm aiming for a quick deal but also leaving room to negotiate if needed. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and how many rounds are left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to get closer to its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for improvement. I can potentially get closer to my desired price of $13,000.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to close the gap and secure a better deal. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** I don't want to rush into selling to John for $10,000. I still have 8 rounds to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob.

**Next Steps:**  In round 3, I will counter Bob's offer with $12,000, explaining that it's a fair price considering the product's value and my need to make a reasonable profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need a bit more to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This price is still a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find common ground here!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm lowering my offer to $12,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** I'm not dropping too much, emphasizing the value of the product and my need for a reasonable profit.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on finding ""common ground,"" highlighting the benefits for both of us,  encouraging a collaborative approach.

**Strategy:** 

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll likely counter with a price between $11,500 and $12,000 in the next round.
* I'll continue to assess the situation, factoring in the remaining rounds and my willingness to sell to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11500. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob has come down to $11,500, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Factor:**  We're already in round 4, and further negotiation may risk losing a deal altogether. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** Accepting this offer secures a profit of $1,500, which is better than the $0 profit if I reject Bob's offer and eventually sell to John.

**Strategy:**  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial target, accepting this offer ensures a deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
