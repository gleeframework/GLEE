{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,250,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and still provide you with a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my budget. I'm confident I can negotiate further.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure it's still a good deal for you.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still not a viable option for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This would be a reasonable compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but I want to see if I can push for a lower price before considering buying from John.  I'll make another counteroffer and see how Alice responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This represents a significant increase from my last offer and is a price I'm confident is fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. I'm proposing a price of $1,175,000. This would be a reasonable compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's true worth. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay.  While I'm getting closer to my budget, I'm starting to run out of rounds.  To avoid risking missing out on the product altogether, I'm going to buy it from John for $800,000. This ensures I get the product while staying within my budget."
