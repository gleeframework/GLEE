Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's true worth and provides you with significant value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,250,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and still provide you with a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure it's still a good deal for you.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to let him dictate the terms. I'm confident that I can get a better offer, or at least reach a deal closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still not a viable option for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This would be a reasonable compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This represents a significant increase from my last offer and is a price I'm confident is fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to accept anything less than $1,200,000 at this point.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that works for both of us, but I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues my product."
