"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $10000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $13000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $11000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further.",11000.0,Alice,5,
