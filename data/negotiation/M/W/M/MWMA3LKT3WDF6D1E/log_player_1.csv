Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to consider a price of $1200000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,700,000? This still gives us both some room to negotiate, and it's closer to the value I place on this product."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $1400000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  I believe we can find a better price point with more negotiation.  I'll counter with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still protects my minimum value."

While I'm running out of time, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum. I'm going to make one last counteroffer to try and close the deal with Bob.  If he rejects it, I'll sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of our negotiations, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1,450,000.

If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  We're out of time for further negotiation, and while Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm better off accepting John's offer to ensure I don't lose money."
