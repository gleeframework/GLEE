"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer demonstrates a serious interest in this product. To be frank, $1,750,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  However, I value your business and I'm motivated to close this deal. If you're willing to come up to $1,825,000, we have a deal.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
