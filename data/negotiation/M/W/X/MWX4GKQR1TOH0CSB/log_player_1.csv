Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer.  I need to make more than $10,000 to make this worth my time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value and hopefully a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm not sure it's worth the risk of going lower and potentially ending up with an even lower offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John and move on."
