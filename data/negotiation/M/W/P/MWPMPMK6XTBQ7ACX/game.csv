"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to counteroffer at $16000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
