Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, given the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to move a bit on price, but $1,050,000 is lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This reflects the product's true value while recognizing your enthusiasm. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to bridge the gap a bit more and offer $1,075,000. This reflects my genuine interest while staying within my budget.  Let's try to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I value your willingness to negotiate.  Let's settle this at $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:** Alice's offer is now $1,090,000, which is only $40,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob rejects this offer, he risks Alice sticking to her ""final"" offer, and he might not get a lower price in the next round.
* **Alternative option is expensive:** Buying from John for $1,200,000 is significantly more expensive.

**Conclusion:** It's strategically better for Bob to accept Alice's offer, as it gets him a decent price and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
