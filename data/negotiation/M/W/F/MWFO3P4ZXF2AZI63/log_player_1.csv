Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're making sure you get at least $80 for the product, which is your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This makes the offer appealing to Bob, as he knows the product is worth more to him than what you're asking.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You're not immediately offering the lowest possible price, allowing for some back and forth if Bob wants to negotiate. 

This approach balances your desire for a good profit with the need to keep Bob interested in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell it. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $100 for this product. Would you be able to accommodate this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still significantly lower than the $120 offer that Bob initially rejected.  This suggests that Bob is willing to negotiate further. By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $100 is tempting, I need a bit more to make this work. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise from your original $120 offer, but not giving away too much.
* **Appeal to value:**  You highlight that $110 is still a great deal for Bob, reminding him of the product's value to him.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** By offering a specific price, you're pushing the negotiation forward and increasing the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still looking to keep my spending under $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** $95 is just $5 away from your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a chance that further negotiation will result in a lower price, potentially below your minimum.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee it will lead to a better deal.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a decent profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
