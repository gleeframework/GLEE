"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is better than Alice's initial value of $120, it's still above Bob's maximum of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still higher than his maximum price from John. This shows he's serious about negotiating but is also trying to maximize his savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still over his maximum of $80. Bob is likely to continue negotiating for a lower price, especially since he has a guaranteed alternative with John at $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $90. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is reiterating his previous offer, hoping Alice will come down to his price.  He's emphasizing the fairness of his offer while staying firm on his position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  I can't go lower than $95.  This is a great product and it's worth the price. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice has come down to $95, this is still above Bob's maximum price of $80.  He has a better deal with John and should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $92. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by moving closer to Alice's offer, but he's still trying to get the best price for himself.  He's also reminding Alice that closing the deal is important, hoping to create a sense of urgency."
