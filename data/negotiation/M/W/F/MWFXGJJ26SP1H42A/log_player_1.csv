{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is a price that is significantly higher than Bob's valuation of $8,000, giving him a good deal.
* **Message:** This is a friendly and encouraging message that emphasizes the value for Bob while also stating my own comfort with the price.

This offer creates a starting point for negotiation, allowing me to potentially secure a price closer to my minimum of $12,000, while also giving Bob a chance to negotiate. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and the possibility of selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm confident that I can push for a higher price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my target. I also have the option of selling to John for $12,000 as a backup, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'd like to see $9,500.  This price gives us both a good deal, and allows me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise from my initial $10,000 offer but still significantly higher than Bob's $9,000 offer.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer, but I'm also restating my needs and highlighting the potential benefits of this price for both of us.

By offering a counter-offer that's closer to my goal, I hope to encourage Bob to accept.  I'm also leaving room for further negotiation if needed, as I can still choose to sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, and while $9,200 is still below my desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum of $12,000.  At this point, it's a good compromise, considering:

* **Potential for further negotiations:**  There's still room for potential negotiations in the future if the relationship with Bob is valuable.
* **Time constraint:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I have the option to sell to John for $12,000.
* **Value for Bob:** The price is still favorable for Bob, giving him a good deal.

Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and move forward. I can always try to renegotiate a higher price in future transactions with Bob if the relationship continues."
