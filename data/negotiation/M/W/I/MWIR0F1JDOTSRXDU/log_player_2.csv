"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that being said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get us started on the right foot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best option in Round 1."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial concession. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $12,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money.  While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards Bob's target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping for. Would you consider $13,000? That's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. Considering the value the product holds for me, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering it to you for $13,250. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is only $250 away from his ideal price of $13,000.  Alice's offer is getting closer, and it's more advantageous than buying from John. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to secure the product while still saving a significant amount compared to John's offer."
