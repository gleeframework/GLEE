# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I know you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $11,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not worth paying more than $10,000 for the product.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,250 is closer to his target price, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer."
