"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. My starting price is $14,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to my maximum budget than her own valuation. I should counter with a much lower price to see how much she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, I aim to:

* **Gauge her flexibility:**  See how much she's willing to move from her initial price. 
* **Anchor the negotiation:** Aim to shift the negotiation closer to my desired price range.

Even if she rejects this offer, it provides a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice moved a bit, but $12,500 is still closer to my maximum budget than her valuation. There's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my target while still showing I'm willing to move up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand we're both trying to find a fair deal, Alice. How about $11,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($12,500) and my previous offer ($10,000). 
* **Demonstrating willingness:**  The increase from my previous offer shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my target. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's still some room for Alice to counter if she's not satisfied, keeping the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is closer, but it's still below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's make it happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, we're nearing the end of the rounds. I want to see if she's willing to go even lower, especially since she said $11,000 was ""below her minimum"". It's worth one more counteroffer to potentially save another $500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close! I'm willing to go up slightly to $11,250. This is a fair offer, and I'm eager to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by increasing my offer, but only by a small amount. This keeps me in a strong position and indicates I'm reaching my limit.
* **Urgency:**  By mentioning my eagerness to close the deal, I'm subtly reminding Alice that I have other options and that time is a factor. 
* **Final offer (implied):**  While not explicitly stating it, this counteroffer is positioned as my final move.  This puts the ball in Alice's court to either accept a reasonable deal or risk losing the sale."
