"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, based on my research and budget, I am only able to offer $12000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $20000. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $16000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $22000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",22000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $18000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm thinking of $24000.
