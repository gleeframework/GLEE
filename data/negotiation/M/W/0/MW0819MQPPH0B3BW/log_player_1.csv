"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards. I'm aiming to get as much as I can, but also want to ensure Bob doesn't immediately walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to see if I can get him to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still keep it above Bob's offer. I want to see if I can meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, and we're already halfway through the rounds. It's not ideal, but it's a safe bet to accept and secure a sale."
