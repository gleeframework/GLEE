"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. My next offer is $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,025,000. I believe the product's value is worth a bit more than that, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $990,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $1,050,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
