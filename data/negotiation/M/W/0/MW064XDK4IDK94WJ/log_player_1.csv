"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to start the negotiation in a way that's attractive to Bob while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $5,000 is far too low for me. It's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and even below his own perceived value of $8,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss.

I'm choosing to reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I will counter with a higher price, aiming to find a compromise within a reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm raising the price to $9,000, which is still a significant discount from my minimum but is closer to a point where Bob might be willing to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging his offer while reiterating my own position. I'm emphasizing the value he'll get at this price and using a friendly tone to encourage further negotiation.
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground that is still profitable for me while remaining appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's previous offer, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I want to see if we can reach a higher price before considering selling to John. I'm choosing to reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500?  That's a great price for you, and it's a deal I can feel good about.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $8,500, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $9,000 and Bob's offer of $7,000. 
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging that I'm willing to compromise and am emphasizing the fairness of the offer for both of us.
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both parties and avoids the need to go through more rounds of negotiation.  I'm also hoping that the ""split the difference"" approach will appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
