"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500?  That's a great price for you, and it's a deal I can feel good about.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
