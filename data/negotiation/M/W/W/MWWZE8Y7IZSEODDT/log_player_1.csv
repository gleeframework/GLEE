Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I believe it's a good starting point.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to negotiate. If he rejects, we can work down from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to make a deal, $500,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm dropping the price to $900,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's initial counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to get impatient, $600,000 is still too low for me.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer, but if Bob rejects it again, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm dropping the price to $850,000, which is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects this, I'm going to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not high enough to make it worth continuing the negotiation. I'd rather get a guaranteed $800,000 from John than risk another round with Bob and potentially end up with even less."
