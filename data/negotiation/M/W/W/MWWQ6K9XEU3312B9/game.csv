,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I think that's a fair price considering the product is worth $150 to you.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $120 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $170 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $140. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",140.0,Bob,4,
