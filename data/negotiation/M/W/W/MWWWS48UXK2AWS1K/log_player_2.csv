"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to part with it for $145. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($120). There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  It's better to try to counteroffer and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $145 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $135? That's still a fair price for you, and it works better for my budget."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you coming down, but I'm looking for something a little closer to my original price. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a better price. Alice is willing to negotiate, so I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still very interested in the product.  $140 is closer, but I'm really only able to go as high as $138.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 138}
