Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us.  How does $1,400,000 sound?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, we want to start negotiations significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). 
* **Room for negotiation:** Offering at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate while still ensuring a substantial profit for you. 
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and expresses willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement, encouraging a positive start to the negotiation. 
 
**Important Note:** While John guarantees $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly might be preferable to avoid potential delays or complications that could arise from waiting for John to finalize the purchase."
