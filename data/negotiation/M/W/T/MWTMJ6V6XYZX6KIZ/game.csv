"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $9,000? That's a fair price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal!",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $8,500. I'm starting to think about buying it from John at $8,000, so I'd like to make a final offer of $8,500. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",8500.0,Bob,6,
