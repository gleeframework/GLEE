Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good deal. I know it's more than Bob values it, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price a bit, but I won't go below my minimum of $10,000. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is still a good amount for Bob, as it's closer to his value than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to close the deal, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,000.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and it avoids the risk of further negotiation.  I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, and I'd be left with John's offer, which is only slightly better."
