"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but  $1,350,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could meet you halfway at $1,075,000. That's a fair offer considering its value to both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I see where you're going with your offer, but $1,075,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to make one more significant move to seal this deal today. How about $1,250,000? This reflects my absolute lowest price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, $1,250,000 is still above my budget.  My final offer is $1,100,000.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
