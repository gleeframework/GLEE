Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response will be telling. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he negotiates, you have room to work with.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept anything below your minimum."
