"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
