"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this offer in the first round. My goal is to set the initial negotiation frame and see how much Bob is willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a tempting offer, it's still lower than what I would get from John. I'm confident I can push for a higher price with Bob, given he's already shown interest.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm dropping the price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price.  I want to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to what I want, I'm still holding out.  John is a safe bet, and I think I can get a bit more from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower the price, but I'm now only $50,000 above Bob's last offer.  I believe this shows that I am serious about selling to him, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm also trying to push the negotiation to a point where we might be able to reach a compromise in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better deal, especially since John is a guaranteed $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm only $50,000 away from Bob's last offer.  I believe this shows I'm willing to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to my desired target.  I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as we are getting very close.  If not, I have to start seriously considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and while $990,000 is close to my target, I'm worried I won't be able to push Bob any higher. John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000, and with only two rounds left, it's safer to accept his offer and avoid any further risk."
