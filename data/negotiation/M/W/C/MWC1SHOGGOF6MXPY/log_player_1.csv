"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($120) but below what I know Bob is willing to pay. This allows for room to negotiate while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $105 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for less than $110 yet. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's split the difference and make this deal work!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $107.50 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. $107.50 is close to my minimum, but I'm willing to see if we can get a little closer to $110.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about $109? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 109}
