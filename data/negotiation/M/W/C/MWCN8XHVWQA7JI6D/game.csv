"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a price closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,150,000 is closer, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $1,050,000.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
