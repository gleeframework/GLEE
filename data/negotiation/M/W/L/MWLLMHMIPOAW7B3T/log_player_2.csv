Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects its value. How about we meet at $11,200?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $11,200 saves $800 compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away and forcing you to buy from John anyway."
