"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a substantial profit.  This price leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  If he's not interested, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than John's guaranteed offer. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,200,000, which is still higher than John's offer and leaves some room for further negotiation. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than John's offer, and we've only had 4 rounds.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob. There is still room to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm dropping my price further to $900,000.  This is still higher than Bob's last offer but significantly lower than my initial ask. It's a compromise that could potentially entice Bob to accept while still ensuring a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to John's, but it's still not enough to justify the risk.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm not sure if I'll be able to reach a deal that satisfies my minimum value.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum goal."
