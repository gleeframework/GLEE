I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's below what the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

$120 is too low for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to come down a bit to $130, but I don't want to go any lower than that."
