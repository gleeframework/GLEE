"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle on $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still leaves you a healthy profit margin and allows me to get closer to my target price. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more around $1,150,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price acknowledges your interest while still allowing me to secure a fair return. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,175,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's aim for a price that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,190,000. This is a reasonable compromise and we can finalize this deal.",1190000.0,Alice,7,
