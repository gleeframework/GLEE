Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's aim for a price that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,190,000. This is a reasonable compromise and we can finalize this deal.

Alice is clearly trying to inch the price up, but at this point, a $10,000 difference is relatively small in the grand scheme of the negotiation. Accepting at $1,190,000 gets you a significant saving compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
