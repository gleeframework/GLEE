"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $102.50? That gives us both a good deal.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand we both want a fair deal, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $96?",96.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $96 is closer, but I'm still a bit uncomfortable at that price. How about $100? It's fair to both of us and allows me to make a decent profit.",100.0,Alice,5,
