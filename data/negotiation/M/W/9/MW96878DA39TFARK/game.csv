"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price closer to what both of us would be satisfied with. Considering the value of the product to me, I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I hope this is within your range.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still significantly below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $1,500,000 to make this deal work.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet the $1,500,000 price point. I'd like to propose a price of $1,350,000, which I believe is fair for both parties involved.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,425,000?  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",1425000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your effort in finding a middle ground, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still not able to meet the $1,425,000 price point. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. I hope this is a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
