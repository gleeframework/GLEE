Round 4

# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet the $1,500,000 price point. I'd like to propose a price of $1,350,000, which I believe is fair for both parties involved.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I still think I can push for a higher price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  It's only slightly below my minimum, but with the limited rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure the sale at $1,400,000 than to risk getting nothing."
