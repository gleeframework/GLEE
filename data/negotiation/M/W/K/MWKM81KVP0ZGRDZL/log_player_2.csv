# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to you, and I know it will be a valuable asset to your business. My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  I'm willing to pay less than $1,200,000, so I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I still get a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This gives us both a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit high, though it's closer to my desired price. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $1,075,000 is still a little more than I'm prepared to pay at this moment.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer.  $1,000,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1,037,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit further. I'm going to reject this offer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm not yet concerned about the time limit, as I have enough rounds remaining to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While $1,037,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for $1,025,000.  I think this is a fair compromise that allows us to both move forward.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I'm willing to come down a little, $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet halfway again at $1,031,250? This is a fair compromise and ensures both of us get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,031,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,031,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,031,250 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,025,000.  Given that we only have a few rounds left, it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in minor price adjustments. Accepting this offer ensures a deal is made within my budget, and I can avoid the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price."
