"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to you, and I know it will be a valuable asset to your business. My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I still get a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $1,075,000 is still a little more than I'm prepared to pay at this moment.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer.  $1,000,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1,037,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While $1,037,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for $1,025,000.  I think this is a fair compromise that allows us to both move forward.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I'm willing to come down a little, $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet halfway again at $1,031,250? This is a fair compromise and ensures both of us get a good deal. What do you think?",1031250.0,Alice,7,
