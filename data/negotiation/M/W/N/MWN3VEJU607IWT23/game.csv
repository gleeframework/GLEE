"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $880,000.

This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",880000.0,Alice,5,
