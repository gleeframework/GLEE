"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is enticing, it's still above your desired price point of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before committing to either offer.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can secure a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting her offer allows you to attempt to secure a better price. You can either make another counteroffer or ultimately decide to buy from John if the negotiation with Alice doesn't produce a more favorable outcome."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $880,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to finalize the deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $880,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $880,000, which is only $80,000 above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's a small enough difference that it's worth accepting her offer.  You're still saving a significant amount compared to her initial price of $950,000, and you avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially breaking down or needing to buy from John."
