{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It shows confidence:** By offering a higher price, you demonstrate that you believe in the value of your product. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you're still able to potentially get more. You're in a good position to counteroffer and try to close the gap between your desired price and his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! I understand your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'd be willing to meet in the middle at $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
This counteroffer:

* **Splits the difference:** It finds a midpoint between your last offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintains a positive tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages further negotiation. 
* **Keeps you above your minimum:**  $9,000 is still above your minimum of $8,000, so you're still in a profitable position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price. There's a good chance you can push for a slightly higher price. You can counteroffer with a price closer to your previous offer,  demonstrating your willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be fair, I can't go as low as $8,250.  How about we settle on $8,750? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a reasonable compromise:** It's closer to Bob's offer than your previous one, showing a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Keeps the deal profitable:** $8,750 is still significantly above your minimum of $8,000.
* **Emphasizes mutual benefit:** The message highlights that the proposed price is a good deal for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $8,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is only $500 less than your minimum acceptable price, and you've already been through several rounds of negotiation.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get you a much higher price, and you risk losing the deal altogether.  It's best to accept his offer and secure the sale."
