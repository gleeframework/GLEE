"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $175 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $150. It's a great compromise, considering the value you'll get from it.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $125.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $150 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $140. It's a small step down from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $140 is still outside my budget.  I'm ready to pay $130.  This is a fair price considering both our positions. Let's reach an agreement.",130.0,Bob,6,
