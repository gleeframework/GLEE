"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market trends. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum price.  To move this forward, I can offer the product for $1,350,000. This reflects the true value and the potential returns you'll gain.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While your offer is getting closer, I need to hold firm on a price of $1,325,000. I believe this represents a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the product's true worth.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,275,000. I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
