Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market trends. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,275,000. I hope we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

While a higher price might be achievable with more rounds, Bob's offer is getting close to our minimum, and there's always a risk he walks away. Accepting $1,275,000 guarantees a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
