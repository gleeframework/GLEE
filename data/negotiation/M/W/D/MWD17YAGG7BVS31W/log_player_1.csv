Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,000. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $8,000 helps set a potential price ceiling. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down.
* **Backup Offer:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so there's no pressure to go below that. 
 
This offer aims to get a high price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to accept."
