Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset for you.  My asking price is $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is a bit more than what Bob is willing to pay, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value the product could bring to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or walk away and sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum of $10,000, and even below my initial offer of $9,500. Accepting this would mean a big loss.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  While Bob's offer is low, he is interested in the product and willing to negotiate. This means there's a chance we can find a mutually acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum or somewhere between his offer and my initial price. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate but also keep my own interests in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a good price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between Bob's offer of $7,500 and my previous offer of $9,500. This shows a willingness to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is still friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.  
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing that this is a good price for both of us, reminding Bob of the value the product holds.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, we have a deal! 
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to decide whether to accept his counteroffer, counter again, or walk away and sell to John. I'll need to consider how much lower I'm willing to go and how much time I'm willing to invest in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,250 is only $750 below my minimum of $10,000. While it's not ideal, it's a significant improvement over his previous offer and represents a good deal for both of us. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag the process on and potentially lead to a lower offer from Bob or a loss of opportunity with John.  
* **Building a relationship:** Accepting a slightly lower offer can build trust with Bob, potentially leading to future opportunities.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale, ensuring a quick and efficient transaction."
