Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,000."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** Your minimum acceptable price is $10,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize your profit, you want to offer the product at a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value to entice him to accept. 
* **The Offer:** Offering it at $14,000 gives Bob a $1,000 incentive to buy from you and secures a $4,000 profit for you, which is significantly better than John's $10,000 offer."
