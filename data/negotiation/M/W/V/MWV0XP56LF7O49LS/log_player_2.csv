Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. In order to find a mutually beneficial solution, I am proposing to sell the product for $11,000. This price acknowledges the product's value to you while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for me.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than John's price of $12,000.
* Accepting this offer means Bob can save $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* It's a good compromise that allows Bob to get the product at a reasonable price."
