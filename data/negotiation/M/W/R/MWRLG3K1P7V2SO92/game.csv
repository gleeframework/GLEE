"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be workable for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $950,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a compromise between our previous discussions. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me. I understand you're not eager to drop to $950,000.  To settle this, I could offer $975,000. This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Do you agree?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $975,000, which would be $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a significant compromise on my part. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
