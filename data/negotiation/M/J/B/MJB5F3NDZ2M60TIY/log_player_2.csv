Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000.

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000, and even if she does, the savings won't be significant enough to justify the continued negotiation.  John offers a guaranteed price that meets your needs."
