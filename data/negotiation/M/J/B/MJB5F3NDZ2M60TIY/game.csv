"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000. I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about $725,000?  That reflects my seriousness about buying while acknowledging the value of the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  $850,000 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $775,000? I think that's a very competitive offer considering John is willing to sell me a similar product for $800,000.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,7,
