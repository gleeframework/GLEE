"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this price reflects its true value. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,300,000 is a good price, I'm still willing to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price. However, Bob still has room to negotiate and can potentially get a better price.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000.  Let's split the difference and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
