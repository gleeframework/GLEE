```

This offer sets a price significantly higher than your guaranteed minimum from John, aiming for a larger profit.  However, it's important to consider:

* **Bob's potential value:**  If you have any information about Bob's needs or the potential value to him, adjust the price accordingly.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  A higher price increases your potential earnings but also makes rejection more likely.  

You might need to adjust this price based on your own risk tolerance and assessment of Bob's potential willingness to pay."
