"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This would still give you a good price while ensuring I get a fair return on my product.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,375,000. How about we try $1,325,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
