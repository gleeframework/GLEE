"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to accept. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950000 for this product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering both our needs.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's original value to me.
