"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it's close to my minimum acceptable price of $100, but also leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still quite a bit lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $130. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway while still ensuring I make a decent profit. Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is close to selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price. There's still time, and I'm not ready to settle for a lower price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $120. This is a final compromise to try and close the deal. While it's lower than I'd like, it's still a good profit for me and avoids selling to John for a much lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $105 is only slightly better than selling to John, it's still a better outcome. With limited rounds remaining and Bob not showing a willingness to move much higher, I'll accept his offer to avoid risking losing the deal altogether."
