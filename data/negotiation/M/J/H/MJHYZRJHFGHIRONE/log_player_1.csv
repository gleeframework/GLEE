Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price in this range could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away.  Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1400000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting confidently but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** You're highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" subtly suggesting it's worth more than Bob might think.
* **""Fair Deal"":** This framing aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a reasonable offer.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to go back and forth a couple of times, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Consider Alternatives:**  If negotiations stall, remind Bob you have other interested buyers, subtly reinforcing your strong position."
