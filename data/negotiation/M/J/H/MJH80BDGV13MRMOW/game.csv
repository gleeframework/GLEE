"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm asking $1,200,000 for it, reflecting its high quality and potential. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I value your perspective on market value, $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this deal work, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  I'm confident this is a price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without sacrificing too much of my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",925000.0,Bob,6,
