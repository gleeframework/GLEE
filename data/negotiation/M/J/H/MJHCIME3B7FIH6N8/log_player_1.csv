Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd be happy to pay $12000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,000 is lower than my initial offer, but still above the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($12,000), I'll choose to accept his offer.
