This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.  Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this unique product.  $1200000 is a bit too low for me at this point. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to gain a reasonable return. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
