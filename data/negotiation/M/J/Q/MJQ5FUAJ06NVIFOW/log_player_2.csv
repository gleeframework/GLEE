{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further.  $800,000 is a good price, but I want to see if I can get it even lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see how much room there is for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than Alice's initial offer, but I don't want to push too hard and risk losing the deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is a bit higher than my initial counteroffer, but still within my budget. However, I'm going to see if I can get her to come down a bit more.  I'm still confident I can get a better price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is increasing her price, which is not ideal.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise.  If she rejects this offer, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is my final offer. If Alice doesn't accept, I'll buy from John. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's, but I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."

Alice's offer is too high for me. I'm going to buy from John for a guaranteed price of $1,200,000. It's not the best deal, but I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the product to another buyer."
