"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, which is well over $1,000,000 to me.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. If you decline, I have a guaranteed sale for $1,000,000 with another buyer. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
