"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice. However,  $1,000,000 is still more than I had in mind. Could you consider $750,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000, but that's as low as I can go.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm ready to make this deal happen.  How about we settle at $825,000?  That seems like a fair compromise that works for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $825,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're so close to a deal! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's wrap this up â€“ how about $850,000? It's a fair price that avoids any further negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, Bob. I really want to make this deal happen, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, we've both invested significant time in this negotiation, and I want to finalize this today.  My absolute best offer is $860,000. This price reflects a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your decision promptly, as time is of the essence.",860000.0,Bob,10,
