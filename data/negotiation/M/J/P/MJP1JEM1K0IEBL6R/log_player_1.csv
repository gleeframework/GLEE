Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering the product at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives me some room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and encourages Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully sold the product for a profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **If the negotiation stalls:** I'll use John as my backup buyer to ensure I get at least my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $85 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation room:**  There's still room to negotiate. I can try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my desired price. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain my profit margin. 
* **Selling to John:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I will sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit to $95. This still gives me some room to make a profit, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $95 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($85).
* **Maintaining Profit:**  While $95 is lower than my initial price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate fairly.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good deal with Bob.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his next counteroffer and determine whether to accept or make another counteroffer.
* **If the negotiation stalls:** I'll sell to John for $120 to guarantee my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. If you're willing to accept that, I'll purchase the product immediately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation deadlocked:**  Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer, and I'm unwilling to go below my minimum. 
* **Guarantee my minimum:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $120, which is more profitable than accepting Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll proceed to sell the product to John for $120.  This ensures I maximize my profits despite the failed negotiation with Bob."
