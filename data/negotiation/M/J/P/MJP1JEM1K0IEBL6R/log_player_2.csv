# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $100. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit to $95. This still gives me some room to make a profit, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to your target price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. If you're willing to accept that, I'll purchase the product immediately."", ""product_price"": 85}
