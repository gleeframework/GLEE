Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth without explicitly revealing your minimum price.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply Bob might miss out if he doesn't take this offer. This creates a slight sense of urgency without being overly pushy.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  Remember, your absolute minimum is $15,000, but aiming higher initially can lead to a more profitable outcome."
