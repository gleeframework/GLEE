"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, but that's my absolute top limit.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,700. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too.",8700.0,Alice,5,
