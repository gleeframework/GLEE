Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $100 is above your $80 minimum, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $100 is less than the $120 Bob values the product at, meaning there's room for him to benefit from the purchase. 
* **It allows for negotiation:**  This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer if he wants to pay less. If he does, you can then adjust your price based on his offer.

By starting with this offer, you maximize your chances of securing a good price while still leaving the door open for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you'd ideally like to get closer to your initial $100 offer, accepting Bob's offer of $90 is the best choice in this situation. Here's why:

* **Profit:** $90 is still significantly higher than your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** Accepting the offer avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, where you might end up with a lower price or even have Bob reject your offer. 
* **Time is money:** Accepting the offer allows you to finalize the sale quickly, which is important in any business transaction.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a good price and avoid the potential delays and uncertainties of further negotiation."
