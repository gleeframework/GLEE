,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $115?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product to you.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $120? That's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
