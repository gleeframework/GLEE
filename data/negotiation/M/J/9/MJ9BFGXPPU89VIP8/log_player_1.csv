"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $115?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a bit more than $115, so I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product to you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $120? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer for $120. While I could potentially get more by continuing the negotiation, it's getting close to the end, and there's a risk I won't be able to get a better deal.  $120 is a good profit for me, and it avoids the risk of having to sell to John for $100."
