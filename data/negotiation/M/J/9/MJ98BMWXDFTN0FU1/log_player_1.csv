Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $900,000, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This price would still allow you a good profit margin, while giving me a better deal.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000.

This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
