"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is a decent deal, it's still above Alice's perceived value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  There's also the option of buying from John, but that's a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $900,000, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This price would still allow you a good profit margin, while giving me a better deal.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming to be aggressive, starting with a price close to Alice's valuation but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  Bob highlights that the offer provides Alice with a profit and emphasizes finding common ground for a successful deal. 
* **Negotiation:** By offering a specific price, Bob provides a clear starting point for further discussions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Fair Deal:**  $875,000 is a reasonable price considering Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000 and Alice's valuation of $800,000. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer eliminates the risk of Alice continuing to hold firm and potentially leading to a situation where Bob is forced to buy from John at a higher price."
