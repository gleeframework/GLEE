"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $900,000, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This price would still allow you a good profit margin, while giving me a better deal.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
