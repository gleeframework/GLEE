"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is still too high for Bob. He wants to save as much money as possible.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets the stage for negotiation and establishes his willingness to make a deal but not at an unreasonable price.  While $700,000 is likely too low for Alice to accept immediately, it provides a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  $750,000 is still a significant savings for Bob compared to John's price, and it's closer to Alice's offer, making it more likely she'll accept.  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance on his desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $825,000 is getting closer to his target, it's still a significant amount.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a slightly lower price before accepting.  He's already shown a willingness to compromise, and there's a good chance Alice will come down a bit more, especially since John's offer is still a viable alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal.  This counteroffer is a significant saving compared to John's offer and only slightly below Alice's last offer. There is a good chance Alice will accept this offer to close the deal. If she doesn't, Bob might need to consider buying from John."
