"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit far from the original offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $975000. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1075000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1075000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll propose $1000000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
