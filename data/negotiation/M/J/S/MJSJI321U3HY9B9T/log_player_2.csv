"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000, giving you negotiating room. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might be able to get her to come down closer to her value of $1,200,000."
