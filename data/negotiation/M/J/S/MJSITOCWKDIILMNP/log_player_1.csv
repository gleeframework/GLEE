Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you're getting a good profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, increasing the chances of him accepting. 
* **It's below Bob's maximum value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting your offer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that low. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000?  That's still a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you can't go as low as my previous offer. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get more, it's a good deal considering the potential of a prolonged negotiation.  I'll accept and move on to other opportunities."
