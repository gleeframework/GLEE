"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns.  I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000, which allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price.  There's a potential to get the product for closer to Alice's value of $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum expectations. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I still receive a fair return on this product. I'm offering to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John.  While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price. Accepting this offer ensures a successful transaction within Bob's desired budget."
