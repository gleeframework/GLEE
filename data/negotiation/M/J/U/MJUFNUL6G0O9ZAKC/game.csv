"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I'm interested, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price point.  To be completely transparent, I have a budget of $8,000 for this.  Would you be willing to accept that?",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I can offer you a compromise at $12,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'd be happy to discuss further, but I won't go below that price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
