"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap from it.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering my own assessment of the product. ",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the true potential of this product for your specific needs.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects the maximum I can pay while remaining within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
