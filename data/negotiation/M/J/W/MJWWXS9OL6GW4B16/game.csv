"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is well above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000.  This is a very competitive price for what you're getting.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  How about $12,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to purchase the product without overextending myself.",12000.0,Bob,4,
