Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a fair price given the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still allowing for a good profit. I am confident that the product's worth to Bob will make him consider this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further to get closer to my desired price, but I won't settle for anything less than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great price for you, given the product's value to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I'm not willing to risk further negotiations and potentially lose more money. While John's offer isn't ideal, it guarantees me a decent profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. I'll sell the product to John for $10,000."
