"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  I'm still looking to get the best possible deal, and $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while ensuring I get a good value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you for $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,025,000 is closer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,010,000 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us, considering my limited budget and your need to make a profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm starting to think that selling to you might not be the best option for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. My revised offer is $1,075,000. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,040,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my last offer. This would allow you to make a respectable profit and get the deal done. If you're willing to meet me halfway, we can finalize this transaction. I am open to discussing further, but I need to stay within my budget.",1040000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,040,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,090,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm starting to think that selling to you might not be the best option for me.",1090000.0,Alice,9,
