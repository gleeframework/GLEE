Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to discuss selling you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to your work, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it at $20,000, which reflects its true worth and potential."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $20,000 is a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm really interested in this product but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting because it meets his maximum valuation, accepting would mean a significant loss for me. I have room to negotiate and try to meet somewhere in the middle.  Selling to John right now would ensure I get my minimum, but I might be able to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $15,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be open to $12,000? It's a fair price considering my limitations and your desire to sell. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to go any higher, and while it's not ideal, getting $12,000 is better than risking him walking away entirely and only getting $15,000 from John."
