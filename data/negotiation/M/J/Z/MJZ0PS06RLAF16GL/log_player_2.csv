It's worth seeing if you can get a better price from Alice. $120 is a good starting point, but you can always try to negotiate lower."

Round 2

I'm going to start by offering $100. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm going to offer $120. This is the same as Alice's initial offer, so it's a reasonable compromise.  It's a good move to show I'm serious about buying, but also pushing to get the best price possible."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting higher, and it's clear she's not willing to negotiate lower than $140. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $150. It's within my budget, and I don't want to risk wasting more time with Alice."
