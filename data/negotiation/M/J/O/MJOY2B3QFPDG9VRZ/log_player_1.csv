"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you something truly unique and valuable. Due to its special nature, I'm starting the bidding at $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth, and I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting high ($1,300,000) anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to counter and feel like he's getting a deal, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John's offer ($1,000,000) in the background provides a safety net and allows Alice to walk away from unfavorable deals.
* **Open Communication:**  The message emphasizes open discussion, fostering a collaborative negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a good one, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product ($1,500,000). Alice has room to negotiate further and try to secure a higher price. Selling to John at this point would be leaving a potential $200,000 on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product is truly one-of-a-kind and holds significant value. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,250,000? "",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:**  Alice is demonstrating that she knows the product's worth and isn't willing to settle for a low price.
* **Incremental Concessions:** Instead of a large jump, she's making a smaller concession ($50,000) to entice Bob while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Maintaining Communication:** The message remains positive and collaborative, aiming to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer of $1,225,000 still secures Alice a $225,000 profit over her minimum.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might yield smaller and smaller increases from Bob, potentially not worth the risk of him walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation and allows Alice to move on to other opportunities."
