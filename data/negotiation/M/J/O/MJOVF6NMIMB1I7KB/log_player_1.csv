"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I know it's a great deal for you, as you've expressed interest in it before.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. Would you be open to discussing a price of $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  There's a good chance Bob will increase his offer slightly, and I'm not willing to give up a profit of $2,500 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $12,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? That's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, would you be open to $12,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling for $12,800. There's a good chance we can find a price that works for both of us, as Bob seems willing to negotiate.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your persistence. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell for $13,200.  This is a fair compromise, considering my minimum price and your budget.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Given the situation, I'd like to propose $12,900 as a final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,900 is still below my minimum price of $15,000.  While we've gotten closer to an agreement, the negotiation has taken a lot of time, and I'm not sure how much more we can improve the price.   John is already willing to pay my minimum price, and I'd rather secure that deal than risk losing out on a guaranteed profit.  It's time to move on and sell to John."
