"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I am willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, however, the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This price reflects its unique value while still providing you a great deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. While $1,750,000 is a significant improvement, I still feel that it exceeds what I can reasonably pay for the product. I would like to propose an offer of $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
