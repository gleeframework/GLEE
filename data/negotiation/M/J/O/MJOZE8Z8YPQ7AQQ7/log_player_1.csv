Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is a good starting point to maximize my profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Leaving room for negotiation allows me to potentially close a deal at a price closer to Bob's value of $150.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $100 provides a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100, which is my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I have the opportunity to counter Bob's offer and potentially reach a deal closer to my desired price.
* **John as a backup:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $115? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with room to negotiate:** I'm offering $115, which is higher than Bob's offer but still below my initial asking price. This creates room for negotiation and allows me to potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize that the price is still a ""good deal"" for Bob, reminding him of the product's value.
* **Focus on needs:** I mention that $115 is ""closer to what I need,"" subtly emphasizing my need for a higher price while maintaining a collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I cannot agree to $115. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? Maybe $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to push for a higher price.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  If the negotiation fails, I can always fall back on John's offer of $100, guaranteeing me a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference - how about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and fairness:**  I'm offering a middle ground by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($115) and Bob's latest offer ($105).  This signals a willingness to compromise and makes the offer seem fair.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I emphasize that $110 is a ""fair price for both of us,"" highlighting the benefit for both parties.
* **Profit margin:**  While $110 is less than my ideal price, it still allows me to make a reasonable profit and avoids losing out on a potential sale to John."
