"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1800000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $1400000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1400000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. How about $1200000?  I'm really excited about this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000 just yet. How about we try to get a bit closer to my initial ask? I'm willing to offer it to you for $1600000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1600000 is a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground again.  How about $1300000?  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not quite ready to meet you at $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $1500000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1500000 is still a bit higher than I can go. I'm firm at $1300000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
