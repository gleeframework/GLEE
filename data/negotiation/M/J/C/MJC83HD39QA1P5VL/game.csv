"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the product's value,  $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering my needs and the market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. To be frank, $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. This product offers significant long-term value that I believe justifies a higher price. Would you consider $1,900,000? This reflects a more realistic compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer and a fair price considering the potential value for me. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this deal work.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
