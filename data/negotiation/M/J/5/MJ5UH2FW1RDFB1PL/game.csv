"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal, as it's significantly lower than what I could get from another buyer.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $11,000? This would be a great price for both of us, and we can close the deal. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate, but $10,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to $11,000.  How about $10,875? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",10875.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit away from my target. How about $10,750 is too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you at $10,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10800.0,Bob,6,
