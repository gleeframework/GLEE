"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $7500.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I appreciate the offer but $7500 is a little too low for me. Considering the unique value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $8500. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
