"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a slightly better deal. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
