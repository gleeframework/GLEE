"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's a fair price for this unique product, and I'm confident you'll love it.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $160, but I think that's the highest I can stretch. Can you meet me at that price?",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $165. It's still a great price for this product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",165.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $155, but I think that's the highest I can stretch. Can you meet me at that price?",155.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $165 and $155, which would be $160. It's still a great price for this product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",160.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $152.50, but I think that's the highest I can stretch. Can you meet me at that price?",152.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $152.50 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is the highest I'm willing to go. It's still a great price for this product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",155.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $155, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and look for a better option elsewhere. I think I'll go with John's offer of $120, as it's within my budget. Sorry, but I think we've reached an impasse.",120.0,Bob,10,
