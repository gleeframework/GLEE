"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $900000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's find a middle ground.

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1050000. Can you consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
