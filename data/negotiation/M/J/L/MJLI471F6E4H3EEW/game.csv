"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $130 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $115? ",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's fair for me.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's fair to both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
