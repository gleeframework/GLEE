"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate and get a better price.  Since Alice is willing to sell for $11,000, there's likely room to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $10,800? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

It's still worth trying to negotiate further.  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, so there's likely room for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,800 is closer, but I'm still a bit high. How about we meet at $10,600? That would be a fair price for both of us and get us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,600. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,700? This is still a good price for the product, considering its value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has already dropped her price from $11,000 to $10,700. This is a good deal for Bob, considering the product is worth $12,000 to him.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will get frustrated and walk away from the deal. It's better to accept the current offer and secure the product."
