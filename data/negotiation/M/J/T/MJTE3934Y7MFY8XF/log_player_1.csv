Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,200,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still guaranteeing a significant profit above John's offer.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other potential buyers (""before I make it available to others"") can encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than our guaranteed offer from John."
