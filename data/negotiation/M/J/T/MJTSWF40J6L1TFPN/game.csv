"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,250,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we are making progress. While your offer is closer to the mark,  $1,250,000 still falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm willing to make one final concession to demonstrate my commitment to finding an agreement. My final offer is $1,650,000.  I believe this is a very reasonable price considering the value this product offers. ",1650000.0,Alice,5,
