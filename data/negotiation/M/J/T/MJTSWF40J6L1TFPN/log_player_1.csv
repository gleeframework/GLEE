Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering its potential benefits for you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2250000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** My message emphasizes the ""unique value"" and ""potential benefits"" to justify the high price without revealing specifics that Bob could use against me in negotiations.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My tone is polite and collaborative, indicating my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Backup Plan (John):**  I'm keeping John as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail to reach a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,250,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I'll counter-offer to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:**  I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the decrease isn't so large that it suggests desperation or undermines the product's value. 
* **Holding Firm Above Minimum:** My new price is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum. This keeps the negotiation alive while protecting my interests.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value proposition without being overly pushy. My goal is to encourage him to see beyond just his initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to hold firm to ensure I don't make a loss. I'll counter-offer again, but I'm getting closer to accepting John's offer if Bob isn't willing to come up significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see we are making progress. While your offer is closer to the mark,  $1,250,000 still falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm willing to make one final concession to demonstrate my commitment to finding an agreement. My final offer is $1,650,000.  I believe this is a very reasonable price considering the value this product offers. "", ""product_price"": 1650000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling that this is my last price reduction, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My price is now slightly above my guaranteed sale to John, making it more appealing to Bob while still leaving room for a small profit if he negotiates down a bit further. 
* **Justification:** I'm re-emphasizing the value proposition to help Bob justify accepting a price higher than his initial offer.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  I'm mentally prepared to accept John's offer if Bob doesn't meet this price.  It's essential not to get emotionally attached to a single negotiation."
