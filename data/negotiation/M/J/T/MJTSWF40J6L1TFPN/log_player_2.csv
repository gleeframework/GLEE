Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we are making progress. While your offer is closer to the mark,  $1,250,000 still falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm willing to make one final concession to demonstrate my commitment to finding an agreement. My final offer is $1,650,000.  I believe this is a very reasonable price considering the value this product offers.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.
