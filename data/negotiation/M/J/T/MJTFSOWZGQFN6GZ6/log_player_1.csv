Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This initial offer gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a substantial profit.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust accordingly.  I'll also be keeping John in mind as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result."

Bob's offer is a good start, but I believe I can get closer to my initial target price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher with my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a substantial profit. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, and I'm satisfied with the potential profit.  It's worth taking this offer rather than risking a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price. I'd rather lock in the sale and be happy with a good outcome."
