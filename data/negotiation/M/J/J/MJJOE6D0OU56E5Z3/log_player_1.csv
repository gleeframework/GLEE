"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However,  $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too wide for me.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say around $1,050,000?  I believe that would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not at a point where I feel comfortable selling. I'm hoping to see if we can get closer to my target price in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to meet in the middle. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement.  To be honest, anything above $1,000,000 is going to be a tough sell for me. How about we make it a clean $1,000,000 and call it a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  While $1,000,000 is a strong offer, I'm still not quite there.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John. I've tried my best to negotiate a good price with Bob, but it's clear we're not going to agree.  John is offering me a price that's much closer to my minimum value, and I'm not willing to risk losing that opportunity."
