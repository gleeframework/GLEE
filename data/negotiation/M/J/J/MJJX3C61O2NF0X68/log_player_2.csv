"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,000,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with his maximum budget and making it clear he's serious about getting the product for this price.  It's a strong opening counteroffer that demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate but also sets a firm limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. Buying from John would save Bob $50,000, but rejecting the offer gives Bob more leverage to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating flexibility while staying within his budget. This counteroffer shows a willingness to meet Alice halfway, making it more likely she'll accept.  It also leaves some room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm not willing to go as low as $1025000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from there. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum budget.  With only 5 rounds left, the potential for a successful negotiation is getting slim.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially getting stuck with a price he can't afford."
