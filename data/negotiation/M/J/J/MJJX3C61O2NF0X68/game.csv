"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm not willing to go as low as $1025000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from there. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
