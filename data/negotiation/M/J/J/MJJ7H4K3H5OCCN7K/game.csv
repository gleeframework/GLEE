"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do right now. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking for a price closer to my budget of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget. While I can't go as low as $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,300,000. This still leaves some room for profit for you and is a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000. This allows us to stay within my financial limits while providing you with a reasonable profit.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,325,000? This price offers a fair compromise for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with $1,300,000. This price is higher than my initial budget, but it's the closest I can get to your original offer while still being within my financial limits.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
