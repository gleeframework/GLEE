This is my initial offer to Bob.  I'm starting high, at $2,000,000, hoping to maximize my profit.  Since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, I'm not under any immediate pressure to sell to Bob at a lower price. I'm curious to see if he's willing to negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. It's definitely not worth selling for that low.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a good profit margin.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm disappointed that Bob hasn't budged much on his price,  $850,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer again and try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

This is my final counteroffer to Bob. I've lowered my price to $1,600,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to give Bob a bit more leeway, but I'm not going any lower. I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince him to close the deal. If he rejects, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far too low, and I've already made significant concessions. It's clear that we are not going to come to an agreement. I've decided to stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This will ensure I at least get my minimum acceptable price and I can move on to other opportunities."
