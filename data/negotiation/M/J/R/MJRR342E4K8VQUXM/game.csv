"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm only comfortable paying $950,000 for the product at this time.  This is still a significant premium for me and reflects the value I see in it.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,100,000.  If you're willing to meet me at $1,050,000, I'd be happy to close the deal.  This is a price that works for me and ensures we both get a good outcome.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
