Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, making him feel like he's getting a better deal. 
* **Strong Alternative:** We have a strong alternative buyer in John.  This allows us to confidently price higher, knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 if Bob declines."
