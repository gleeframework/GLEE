"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000, which is less than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **You can still negotiate with Alice:** Rejecting the offer doesn't mean you can't still try to get a lower price from Alice. You have a good starting point to negotiate. 

By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious about getting a better price."
