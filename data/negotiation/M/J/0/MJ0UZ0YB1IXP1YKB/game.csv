"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I understand its worth to you is $1,200,000, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  To make this a mutually beneficial deal, I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000.  This price reflects a slight premium, but it also allows for a smooth transaction and ensures I get a fair return.  Let me know your thoughts. ",1250000.0,Alice,1,
