"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. However, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $8,000. Considering the value of the product and the fact that another buyer is willing to pay $12,000 for it, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to that figure. Would you be open to discussing a price between $9,000 and $10,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
