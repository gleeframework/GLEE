Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. However, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $8,000. Considering the value of the product and the fact that another buyer is willing to pay $12,000 for it, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to that figure. Would you be open to discussing a price between $9,000 and $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
