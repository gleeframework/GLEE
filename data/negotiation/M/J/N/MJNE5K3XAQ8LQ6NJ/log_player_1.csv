``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This sets the stage for a negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. That's my top offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $1,750,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,575,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. "", ""product_price"": 1575000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet at $1,450,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a higher price, so I'll reject Bob's offer. I'll try to meet him halfway in my counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go much lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,525,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,450,000 and $1,525,000, so how about $1,487,500? That's my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,487,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,487,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but I'm not sure I can get much higher. John is offering me my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with him. It's time to secure a sale."
