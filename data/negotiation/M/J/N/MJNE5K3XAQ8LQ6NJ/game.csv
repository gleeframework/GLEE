"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. That's my top offer for now.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,575,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. ",1575000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet at $1,450,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,525,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,450,000 and $1,525,000, so how about $1,487,500? That's my best and final offer.",1487500.0,Bob,6,
