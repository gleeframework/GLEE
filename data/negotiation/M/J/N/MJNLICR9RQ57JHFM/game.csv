"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer for the product is $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its worth to me and the fact that I can get it from John for $10,000. Let's find a way to make this work.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but $12,000 is a bit low considering its worth to me is $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $16,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering it's closer to my value and still leaves some room for you to make a profit.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $15,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I have in the product, and it's still a good deal for you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
