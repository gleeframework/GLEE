Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $150 to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I want. I'll counter with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm lowering my price, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable value of $150. This shows flexibility while still trying to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still offering significantly less than what I want, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  However, with John willing to pay my minimum, it makes more sense to sell to him now and avoid further negotiation."
