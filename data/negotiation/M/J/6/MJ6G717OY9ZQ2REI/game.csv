,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is there any flexibility on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, as I believe the product's value is well above this amount. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $12500. This is the best price I can offer, as I'm already sacrificing my profit margin. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'll offer it to you for $12200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, as I'm already losing money at this point. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're willing to walk away, Bob, but I'm still willing to try to reach an agreement. I'll make one more concession and offer it to you for $11500. This is my final offer, as I'm already losing money at this point. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11250. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",11250.0,Bob,10,
