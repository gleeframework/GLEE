"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be beneficial, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and professional tone is important throughout the negotiation.
* **Target in Mind:** Remember, my goal is to get the product for as close to $1,200,000 as possible."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice moved closer to my range, $1,300,000 is still $100,000 more than I can buy it from John. 
* **Strategic Counter-Offering:** By continuing to negotiate, I might be able to get Alice closer to my ideal price or at least a price closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $1,150,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between her last offer and my last counter-offer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Budget:** By reiterating my budget concerns, I'm subtly reminding Alice that I have other options (John).
* **Positive Language:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:** Alice has explicitly stated this is her final offer and implies she won't go lower. 
* **Marginal Savings:** While I could try to negotiate further, Alice's last offer is only $50,000 less than John's. It's unlikely I'll be able to get that difference in further negotiation. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate costs time and effort. Accepting John's offer provides a guaranteed price and closes the deal."
