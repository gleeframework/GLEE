The goal is to maximize profit.  While selling to John for $1,200,000 is an option, there's a chance Bob might come up in the next round.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for a potential higher price."

``` 

The negotiation has reached a point where the potential gains from continuing are outweighed by the risk of Bob not increasing his offer further. With only two rounds remaining, the chances of securing a better price than John's $1,200,000 offer are slim. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation uncertainty."
