Alice is still significantly above John's price. It's worth negotiating further."

Alice seems quite firm and unlikely to move much further.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of Alice refusing and sticking closer to her price.  Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees the best outcome for you."
