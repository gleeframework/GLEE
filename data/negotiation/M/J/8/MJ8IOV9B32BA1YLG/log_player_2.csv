"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is lower than my maximum budget of $800,000, so there's potential to save money. It's worth exploring further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a lower price while remaining within my budget. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but also incentivizes her to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a lower price.  John offers a certain price, and buying from him eliminates the risk of further negotiation and potential delays."
