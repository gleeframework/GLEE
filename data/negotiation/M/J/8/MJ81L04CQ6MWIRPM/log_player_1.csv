{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum but not so high that it's immediately rejected.  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $120? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. It's worth risking a round of counteroffers to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we split the difference? $125 is still a fair price for this product, and it gives us both a bit of room to be happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
