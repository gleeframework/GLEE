"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This still gives you a solid return on your investment, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
