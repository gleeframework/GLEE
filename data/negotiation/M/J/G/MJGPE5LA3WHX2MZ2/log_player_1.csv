"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity for your business, and I believe it's worth $2,000,000.  Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm framing the offer in terms of value to Bob, highlighting the unique opportunity. This might encourage him to consider a higher price. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm inviting Bob to discuss further, signaling flexibility and a willingness to find common ground. 

This strategy aims to establish a strong starting point while leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters.  It also keeps the door open to potential concessions, potentially leading to a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and see the value in the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  I'm not willing to settle for a loss at this point. 
* **There are still rounds left:** I have opportunities to negotiate further with Bob, potentially pushing the price closer to my desired range. 
* **John is a backup:**  While John's offer is attractive, I'm not desperate to sell right away. I'm still hopeful that I can secure a better deal with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This still gives you a solid return on your investment, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000, showing willingness to negotiate, but still maintaining a comfortable margin above my minimum.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the potential return on investment.
* **Collaborative Language:** I use phrases like ""both of us"" and ""bridge the gap,"" promoting the idea of a mutually beneficial agreement.

This approach aims to demonstrate a commitment to a deal while maintaining a firm stance on the price.  It keeps the negotiation moving forward without giving away too much ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect your position, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,500,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 aligns perfectly with my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We're already on round 4, and I don't want to risk losing out on this deal. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John is a safe alternative, there's no reason to wait and potentially lose out on a deal that meets my minimum requirement.

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me the desired profit, securing a successful outcome in this negotiation."
