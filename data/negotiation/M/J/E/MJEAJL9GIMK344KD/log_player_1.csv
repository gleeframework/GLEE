Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value that would benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $9,500 is a substantial profit over John's offer of $8,000.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale to John if Bob declines."
