Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial discount compared to our guaranteed sale price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a firm offer, the slightly lower price might encourage Bob to counter-offer, opening the door for further negotiation toward a mutually beneficial deal.

This approach balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
