"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $11,500. I think this is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. There's room for Alice to come down, as she values the product at $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. Accepting the offer at $11,000 saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and Bob ultimately needing to buy from John at $12,000 outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
