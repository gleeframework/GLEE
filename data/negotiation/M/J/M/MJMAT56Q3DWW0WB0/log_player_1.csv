Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a higher price than my minimum ($80) and gives Bob room to negotiate. I'm hopeful he'll accept, but if he doesn't, I'll be ready to counter and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price.  If it doesn't work out, I can always sell to John."
