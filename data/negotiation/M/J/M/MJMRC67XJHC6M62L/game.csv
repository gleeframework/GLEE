"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming a bit lower. Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but $725,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Alice,5,
