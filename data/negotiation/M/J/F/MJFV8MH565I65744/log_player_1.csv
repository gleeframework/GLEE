Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment at $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit, but Stay Realistic:**  While Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting too high (like $1,150,000 or more) risks immediate rejection. 
* **Strong Incentive for Bob:** Offering it at $1,100,000 gives Bob a $100,000 incentive to buy from you instead of exploring other options (which might not even exist in his mind).
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** This price point ensures you make a substantial profit of $300,000, which is significantly better than the $800,000 you'd get from John.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no knowledge of other potential buyers besides John. If you had multiple interested parties, your strategy might shift to encourage a bidding war."
