"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment at $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than your maximum price of $1,200,000. However, you know you have an alternative with John. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price or proceed with John if necessary."
