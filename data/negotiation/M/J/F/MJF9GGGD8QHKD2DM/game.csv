"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you.  I understand its worth to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $1,000,000. This price allows you a substantial gain while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
