"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate the product's unique features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial thoughts. However, I'm still not willing to go above this price.",1700000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while still being a good deal for you.",2000000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $2,000,000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,600,000 is cutting it quite close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,850,000, but that's my absolute limit. This offer stands as a testament to my desire to see this deal through with you.",1850000.0,Alice,5,,
