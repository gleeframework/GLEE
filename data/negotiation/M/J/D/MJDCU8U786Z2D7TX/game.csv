"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,000?  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I'm really interested in getting this product. Can you consider my offer?",12500.0,Bob,4,
