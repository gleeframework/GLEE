"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than the product's value to her ($900,000 vs. $1,200,000).  There's room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but it is more realistic given the value of the product to Bob. This counteroffer represents a reasonable starting point for negotiations and leaves room for both parties to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $850,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's counteroffer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a lower price by rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially secure a price closer to his initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering my value for the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is now a more realistic compromise. It's closer to Alice's last offer but still reflects Bob's desire to get a good deal. It demonstrates his willingness to negotiate but also sets a clear limit on his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $800,000.  While there is still some room for negotiation, accepting this offer would secure the product for a price well below Bob's maximum budget and significantly below the price offered by John. 

Since Bob has only 5 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal. It's important to consider that Alice may not be willing to go any lower and Bob could end up paying more if he keeps rejecting offers."
