"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is your maximum budget, there's no reason to rush into buying at Alice's initial price.  You can try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejection opens the door for potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $7,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** This counteroffer is a significant 25% reduction from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating. 
* **Fairness:** $7,500 is still a decent price for a product you're interested in, while giving Alice room to counter if she feels it's too low. 
* **Openness:** The message expresses interest in the product while making a firm price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8750? It's a fair compromise that would still be a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, there's still room for negotiation. I'm not in a rush, and I can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting and offering a counter-counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. $8,750 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. How about $8,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be able to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I'm not ready to accept yet, but I'm showing Alice I'm serious about buying.  
* **Reasonable Counter:**  The counteroffer is a smaller jump than before, signaling that I'm getting closer to my limit.  
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize the ""good deal"" for both of us, hoping to get Alice to see that a smaller compromise would be beneficial."
