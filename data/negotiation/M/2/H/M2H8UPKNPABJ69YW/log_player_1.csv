Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with an offer of $10,000, knowing the product is worth at least $8,000 to me. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit.
* **Positive framing:** My message highlights the product's value and emphasizes the deal's potential attractiveness.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond, making it clear I'm willing to negotiate.

This strategy allows me to explore Bob's potential value for the product while setting a high initial bar. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest based on his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or switch to John's guaranteed $8,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $7500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, it's still below what I'm hoping to get for the product. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I believe I can potentially get closer to my initial asking price of $10,000, especially considering Bob expressed interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,750? It's a fair compromise that would still be a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** Instead of rejecting outright, I'm offering a compromise at $8,750. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground, while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the fairness and value of the offer for both parties, highlighting the potential benefits of the deal.
* **Direct request:** I directly ask for Bob's thoughts and encourage a continued dialogue, keeping the negotiation open. 

This strategy aims to increase the chances of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. $8750 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. How about $8000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be able to finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more,  it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and ensures I don't lose out on the potential profit."
