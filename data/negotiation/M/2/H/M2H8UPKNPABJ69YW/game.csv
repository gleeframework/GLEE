"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $7500.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8750? It's a fair compromise that would still be a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. $8750 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. How about $8000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be able to finalize the purchase.",8000.0,Bob,4,
