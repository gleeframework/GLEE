"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to commit to a budget of $1050000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me. Looking forward to your response.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1075000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1200000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal, but I'm still unable to meet at $1075000. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1062500. This brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement while still respecting my budget constraints.",1062500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1062500. I'm willing to meet you at $1090000, which is the highest I can go without sacrificing my own profit margin. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me.
