"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and ensures that I'm pushing for the best possible price, even though I have a backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still higher than what Bob offered but closer to his potential value. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to take $9,200, I'm still holding out for a better price.  John is a good backup, but I believe I can get closer to my minimum with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $10,000, my minimum price.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and I'm hoping this price will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing out on the deal completely."
