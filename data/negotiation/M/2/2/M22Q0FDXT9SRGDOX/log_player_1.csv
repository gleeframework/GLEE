Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price. There's no room for negotiation here.
