"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $87.50 is closer, but I'm still aiming for $85.  Let's split the difference and do $86.25 - that's a fair price for both of us.",86.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $88. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $86.25 and $88, which would be $87. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",87.0,Alice,5,
