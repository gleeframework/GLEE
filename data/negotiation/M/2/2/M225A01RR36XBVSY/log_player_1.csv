Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $550,000. I believe this is a more reasonable starting point for our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both our valuation and our desired outcome.  We have plenty of room to negotiate.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and propose a price of $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.
