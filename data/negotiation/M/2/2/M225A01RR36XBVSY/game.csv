"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $550,000. I believe this is a more reasonable starting point for our negotiations.",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $550,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and propose a price of $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here, but I need you to understand this product is in high demand.  My final offer is $850,000. This is non-negotiable, take it or leave it.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,6,
