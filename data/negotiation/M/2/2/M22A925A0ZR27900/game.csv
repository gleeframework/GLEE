"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and I need to get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $10,500 for it. How about we try to find a middle ground?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I like the fact that we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $9,750. I'm willing to go up to $10,250, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
