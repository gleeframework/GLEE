"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me at that price?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 isn't quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That way, we both get a fair price and we can finalize this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit short on budget, so I was thinking $98 would be a more comfortable price for me. Can you meet me there?",98.0,Bob,6,
