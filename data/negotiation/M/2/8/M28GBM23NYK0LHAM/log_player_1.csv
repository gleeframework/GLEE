"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion to encourage Bob to negotiate rather than simply reject. 
* **Strategic Price:** $100 leaves space for negotiation while still giving me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $90 is a decent offer, Bob's willingness to negotiate means there's still room for me to push for a better price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Rejecting the offer sets the stage for me to counter with a price closer to my desired $100.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $80 would be a loss compared to the potential of a higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about $95? This is a great product, and I think it's worth the extra investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm raising the price slightly, but not by too much, to show that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to make Bob see the potential for a good deal.
* **Staying in the Game:**  $95 is still a good profit for me while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. Let's try $92 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $92 is just $3 away from my initial target of $95.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I could try to push for another $3, there's no guarantee Bob will agree. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and a good profit."
