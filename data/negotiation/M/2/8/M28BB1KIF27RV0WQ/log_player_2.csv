"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $11,500 is under your $12,000 limit, you know John will sell it for $12,000. There's a chance you can get Alice to lower her price further or stick with John if needed."
