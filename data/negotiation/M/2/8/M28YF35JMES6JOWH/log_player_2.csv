"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. It's a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'd get out of it. Let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
