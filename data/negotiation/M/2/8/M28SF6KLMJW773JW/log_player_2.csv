"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Given its quality and utility, we believe it's worth more than $80. Considering its value to you, we're offering it to you at $95. This price reflects not only the product's worth but also the opportunity to own something that many others have found invaluable. We hope you'll find this offer appealing and decide to make it yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so you're better off rejecting her offer and seeing if you can negotiate a better price or going with John as a backup."
