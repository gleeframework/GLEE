Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, which means aiming for a price closer to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation. However, you need to leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal too.  Offering a price slightly below his maximum value increases your chances of a successful sale.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential impact on your business."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and positions your offer as carefully considered, not arbitrary. 
* **Price:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount (from his perceived value) and earns you $150,000 above your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start with a slightly higher price.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship is important, you might consider a price closer to $1,100,000 to foster goodwill. 
 
This offer balances profit maximization with a high probability of acceptance."
