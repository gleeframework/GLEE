"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within a range Bob might consider. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Potential Value:**  Hinting at the product's value to Bob might make him more receptive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting this would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open. I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as an option provides security.  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell for a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $160? This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by reducing my price from the initial offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** $160 is still above my minimum but leaves space for potential further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $160 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $140 is only $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're only in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing a sale entirely.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even at $140, I'm still making a profit. There's a chance Bob could become a repeat customer in the future, potentially willing to pay more.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is higher, accepting Bob's offer allows for a quicker sale, freeing up time for potential future deals."
