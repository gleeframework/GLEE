"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $11,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from the product. Let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
