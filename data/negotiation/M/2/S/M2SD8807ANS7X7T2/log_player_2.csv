"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but it's likely she's willing to go lower.**  $800,000 is a significant discount from John's price, but there's room for negotiation. 
* **We have 10 rounds to get a better deal.** There's no need to rush into accepting the first offer.

**Next Steps:**

* We'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** A $100,000 reduction from Alice's offer is significant, but not unreasonable. We're showing that we're serious about a deal, but also pushing for a better price. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge how flexible Alice is. If she accepts, great! If she rejects, we'll adjust our strategy based on her counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* We'll analyze Alice's response and adjust our strategy accordingly in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is meeting us halfway:**  She's come down from $800,000 to $750,000, showing she's willing to negotiate.
* **Significant savings:**  $750,000 is a substantial discount from John's $1,000,000 price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice might not budge further.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with a higher price later.

**Next Steps:**

We've secured the product at a favorable price. The negotiation is complete!"
