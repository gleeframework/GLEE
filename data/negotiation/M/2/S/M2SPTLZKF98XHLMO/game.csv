"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  However, I'm not quite ready to pay $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $11,250? That's a fair compromise and a good step towards closing this deal.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, but I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. How about we meet in the middle again at $11,750? It's a small concession, but it's the best I can do at this point.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable paying that much.  Let's aim for a price that works for both of us.  How about $11,500? This would be a great middle ground for us to close the deal, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go any higher than $12,200. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal.",12200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we could finally close this deal.  Let's make it happen!",11750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still willing to listen. I can't go any higher than $12,000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. How about we meet at $11,900, and I'll include a premium support package and a 30-day money-back guarantee? This is my final offer, so let me know if it's acceptable.",11900.0,Alice,9,
