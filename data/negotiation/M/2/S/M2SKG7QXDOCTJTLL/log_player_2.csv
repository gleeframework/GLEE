"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested but I'm hoping to get it for a bit closer to $12,000. How about $12,500? "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's value of the product but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This shows good faith while also pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  $12,500 is a little low for me, but I'm open to coming down a bit more. How about $13,500? It's still a good deal for you and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get the price even lower. Bob is still within his budget and has plenty of rounds remaining to try and find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still hoping to get it for a little less.  How about $13,000?  This seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a price slightly higher than his last offer but still lower than Alice's current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still striving for a better deal."
