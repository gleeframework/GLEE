``` 

This initial offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also trying to build rapport by expressing my belief in the product's value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $180 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $200.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $175 is getting closer to my minimum of $150, I'm not desperate to sell. I still have rounds left and want to see if I can get a bit closer to my desired $190."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $177.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $177.5

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While $177.5 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to go that low yet. I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my desired $182.50 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I think we're very close to an agreement. Let's meet in the middle at $180.  I'm sure you'll be happy with this product, and I'm confident we can both be satisfied with this price."", ""product_price"": 180}
```"

Round 8

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $178. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $178
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer of $178.  We're running out of rounds and I'm getting closer to my minimum price.  While I'd prefer $180, $178 is a decent compromise.  It's also better than selling to John for $150."
