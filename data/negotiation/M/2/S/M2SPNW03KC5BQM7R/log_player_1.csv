I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I'll always have John as a backup at $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$100 is below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $150. It's still above my minimum, and hopefully, he sees that I'm willing to negotiate."

Bob is now offering my minimum, so I'll accept his offer. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm glad we were able to negotiate a price that works for both of us."
