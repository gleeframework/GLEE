This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum but still leaves room for potential counteroffers. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to sell to him, I'm holding out for a better price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $105. How about we meet at $95? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm confident that John will buy the product for $100, which is a better deal than accepting Bob's offer."
