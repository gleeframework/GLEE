Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what Bob values the product at. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** $115 is a fair starting point, leaving space for Bob to counter with a lower price.
* **Knowing the alternative:** I'm aware that I can sell the product to John for $120, so I won't accept any offer lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm hoping to get a better price. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $105 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation is possible:** I can still potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If I can't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob, I know I can sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's a good price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows willingness to negotiate and meet halfway.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of a deal at $110 for both of us.
* **Clear and concise:** The message is short and to the point, focusing on the price and the mutual benefit.
* **Avoiding a stalemate:** By offering a slightly lower price, I'm trying to avoid a situation where we both keep rejecting each other's offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $108. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  $108 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Risk of losing deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away and I might not be able to get a better price.
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  Even though I'm accepting a lower price, I'm still making a profit and I have John's offer as a safety net if the deal falls through."
