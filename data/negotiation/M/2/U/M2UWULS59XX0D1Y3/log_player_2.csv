{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $200,000 above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,150,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price or the need to buy from John."
