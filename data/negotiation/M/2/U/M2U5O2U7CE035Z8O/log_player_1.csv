Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that value as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer him the product for $11,500.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent offer. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, I'm not willing to accept his offer of $11,000, as it's below my minimum acceptable price.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, making a counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $11,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll try to get closer to the product's true value to him, which is $12,000. Let's see... I'll offer the product to Bob for $11,800.

I've already tried to negotiate with Bob, and it's clear that we're not going to meet in the middle. I think it's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John, who is willing to pay the full $15,000.
