"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. This is a good starting point for negotiation. I've also included a friendly message to keep the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still above my budget of $80. While it's closer to my desired price, I still have some room for negotiation and can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90.  If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'm ready to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm incrementally increasing my offer by $5, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to stay within my budget. By emphasizing that I'm ready to make a deal if she meets me halfway, I'm putting pressure on Alice to compromise."
