Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, aiming to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. I've also included a friendly message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm confident that I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob.  I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90.  If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'm ready to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for $100, $90 is still a good deal and above my minimum acceptable price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is a sure thing at $100.  It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially lose money trying to get a few dollars more."
