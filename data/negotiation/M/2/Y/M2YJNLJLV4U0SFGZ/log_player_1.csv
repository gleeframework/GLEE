Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While we know Bob values the product at $80, starting above his valuation gives him the opportunity to negotiate down towards a price that might still be profitable for you. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping John's offer ($100) in mind provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, you can always fall back on selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $100. You have room to negotiate further, and it's worth seeing if you can bridge the gap.  You'll reject this offer and prepare a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but the product is quite valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic can feel fair to both parties. 
* **Above Minimum:**  You're still aiming for a price above your minimum ($100).
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help you gauge how much Bob is willing to move from his initial offer.  If he flat out rejects this, you can reassess if continuing negotiation is worthwhile or if selling to John is the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to keep the cost within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price and the guaranteed offer from John. There's no strategic advantage to continuing negotiations. Accepting this offer ensures you make your desired profit."
