# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. I believe it's a valuable asset that can bring significant benefits to your business. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $1,000,000. I need to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and start the bargaining process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately far below the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1300000. This price reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from owning this product, and it's still within a reasonable range. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my limit. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really pushing the limits of my budget at $1,100,000. If we can't find a solution at this price point, I might have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
