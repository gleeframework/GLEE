"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately far below the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This price reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from owning this product, and it's still within a reasonable range. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really pushing the limits of my budget at $1100000. If we can't find a solution at this price point, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more than $1,200,000, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  It's clear we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
