"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm looking for.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately far below the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1300000. This price reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from owning this product, and it's still within a reasonable range. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really pushing the limits of my budget at $1100000. If we can't find a solution at this price point, I might have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
