"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential.  I'm asking for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
