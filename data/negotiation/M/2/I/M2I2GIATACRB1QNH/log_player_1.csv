Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Bob's offer:

Bob is not moving substantially towards a price point that makes sense for me.  It's time to take John's offer and ensure I get the value I need from this sale."
