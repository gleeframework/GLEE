Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob. 
* **Start High:** Offering a price of $19,000 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters. This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit.
* **Strategic Wording:** The message hints at the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, potentially persuading Bob to accept a higher price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting your offer. You need to weigh the potential for a higher profit against the certainty of selling to John at $15,000."
