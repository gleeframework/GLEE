"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think it's a steal at this price and you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your maximum price. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your actual top price ($120). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite but clearly states that the initial offer is unacceptable.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $100 is significantly below its value. Could you do $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down in price, $140 is still above your $120 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a decent chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since you have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $140 is closer, but it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're moving closer to your maximum price ($120) to show Alice you're serious but still aiming for a good deal.
* **Staying Below John:** The offer of $115 keeps you below your backup option of buying from John for $120.
* **Testing Flexibility:** This counter-offer will help determine if Alice is willing to negotiate within a price range acceptable to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $115.  My final offer is $130.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:** Alice has presented her ""final offer"". It's unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **Over Budget:** $130 is still above your maximum budget of $120. 
* **John is Reliable:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at your target price. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take advantage of the deal with John."
