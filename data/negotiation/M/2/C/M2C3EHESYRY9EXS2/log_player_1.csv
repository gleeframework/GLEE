Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to get as close to that price as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $149 leaves a small window open for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested, while still securing a near-optimal price for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Starting at $150 might seem like you're unwilling to negotiate, potentially pushing Bob away.

It's important to note that there's no guarantee Bob will accept $149, but it strikes a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale."
