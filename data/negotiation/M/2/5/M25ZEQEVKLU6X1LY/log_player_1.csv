Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see the value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This would still be a significant profit for you, while giving me a reasonable price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
