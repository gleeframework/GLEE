"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a successful negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,075,000. This is a fair price that's closer to both our ideal numbers, and it shows my commitment to closing this deal. What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000.  How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to go down to $1,090,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get closer to our ideal price.  Let's close this deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1,090,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,075,000.  It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal and move on.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
