Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a successful negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

This is a fair price that's closer to both our ideal numbers, and it shows my commitment to closing this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000.  How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to go down to $1,090,000.
