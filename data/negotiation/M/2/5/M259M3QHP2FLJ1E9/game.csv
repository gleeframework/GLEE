"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",100.0,Alice,3,,

"I like your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $95. How about we try $98? I'm getting a bit closer to my minimum price, but I still need to make a decent profit.",98.0,Alice,5,,
