Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob to make the price seem more justifiable.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message conveys a willingness to negotiate, inviting Bob to counteroffer if he's not satisfied.
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup, allowing me to confidently reject any counteroffers that are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While closer to my desired price, $9,500 is still significantly less than my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the security to decline Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value this product holds for you.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000. This shows good faith and encourages Bob to move closer to my desired price point.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's value to Bob to justify my price.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing $11,000 as a ""fair compromise,"" making it more palatable for Bob.
* **Openness:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation by saying ""Let's see if we can make this work."" 
* **John's Safety Net:** With John's offer in the background, I can confidently reject any counteroffers below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's try to make this work, as this is the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $10,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000, even with Bob's insistence that it's his highest offer.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate where we both refuse to budge, leaving me with nothing. 
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob.  

This decision prioritizes securing a guaranteed profit over the possibility of a slightly better price from Bob, which is not guaranteed and could lead to a negative outcome."
