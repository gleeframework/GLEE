"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value this product holds for you.  Let's see if we can make this work!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's try to make this work, as this is the highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
