"Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95,  which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $92.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",92.5,Bob,4,
