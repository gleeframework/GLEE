{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, and still allows for a profitable sale if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is a better price than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95,  which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $92.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $92.50 is still below my minimum threshold of $100.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm confident John will pay my asking price, so I'll choose to sell the product to him."
