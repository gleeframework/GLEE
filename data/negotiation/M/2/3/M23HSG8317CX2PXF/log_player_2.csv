"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it can significantly benefit you, and I'm confident you'll find this a fair and attractive offer.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and also less than what John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
