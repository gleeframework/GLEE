You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $13,500 is over Bob's budget, and he can get the same product from John for $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."
