"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to part with it for $14,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is quite high, close to your maximum budget and significantly above her own valuation. There's plenty of room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $11,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still well above her perceived value leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Signaling Interest:**  By stating you are ""interested"" and offering a specific number, you show Alice you're serious about buying, but not at any cost. 
* **Anchoring:** This counteroffer attempts to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to your desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $11,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you in the middle. How about $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $13,000 is still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product.  There's room for further negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice. How about we settle at $11,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 11750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims for roughly the middle ground between your previous offer ($11,000) and Alice's current offer ($13,000).
* **Showing Flexibility:** You're moving closer to Alice's price, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but not conceding too much ground.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By sticking to a price well below her initial offer, you keep the pressure on Alice to move further down."
