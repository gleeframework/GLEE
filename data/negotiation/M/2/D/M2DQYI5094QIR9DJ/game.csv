"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, which is what I'd need to make this deal work for me. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $17,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my $15,000 budget. Would you be willing to go to $16,000? That would be a fair compromise.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but I need to make a profit, so I'll go up to $16,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to go a little higher, but $16,500 is still stretching my budget. How about we settle at $16,000? I think that would be a fair compromise for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll sell the product to you for $16,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",16250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price, and I know we're getting closer. However, I'm still a bit over my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $16,000? I'm really hoping to finalize this deal, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've made a lot of concessions, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,250. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, like a free consultation and a 6-month warranty. I think this is a great value for you, and I'm hoping you'll take it.",16250.0,Alice,9,
