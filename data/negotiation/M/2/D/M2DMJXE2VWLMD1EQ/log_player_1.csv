Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! However, I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm still willing to negotiate with Bob, but I'll need to see a more significant offer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,750 isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's aim for a win-win here."", ""product_price"": 10250}
