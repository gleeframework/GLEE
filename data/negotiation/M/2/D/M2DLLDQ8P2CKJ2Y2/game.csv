"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1800000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1200000 is still outside my range. I'm willing to go to $900000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the purchase. Let's find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
