Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe it would be very valuable to you.  I'm asking for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 
 
This is a starting point in the negotiation. Here's why:

* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:** Starting at $10,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum price. Bob might be willing to pay a premium for something he values.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value to Bob, I'm subtly anchoring the price in his mind to its worth rather than just a number.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John provides me with a fallback option and strengthens my position in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I know I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, so I'll try to negotiate with Bob a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't go as low as $7,500.  Would you consider $9,000?  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I came down $1,000 from my initial offer to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiteration of Value:**  I'm continuing to emphasize the product's value, subtly steering Bob away from focusing solely on the price.
* **Midpoint Strategy:** This counteroffer aims for a price closer to the midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, which is a common negotiation tactic.
* **John in the Background:** I'm still keeping John as a backup plan but haven't revealed that information to Bob, as it maintains my negotiating leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price, and while I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk he might walk away. Taking the $8,200 ensures a profit and avoids the potential of losing Bob as a buyer."
