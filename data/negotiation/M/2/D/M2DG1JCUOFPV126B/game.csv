"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. My new offer is $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go to $1,000,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to finalize the purchase. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My new offer is $1,050,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
