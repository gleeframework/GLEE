"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it still exceeds your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You can get the same product from John for a lower price, making it the more financially sound choice."
