"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth at least $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's worth $10000 to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting very close to my desired price, and I'm not sure how much more I can push him. Given the limited rounds, accepting his offer is a reasonable choice. It's still significantly higher than his initial offer and allows me to secure a sale without risking losing the deal entirely."
