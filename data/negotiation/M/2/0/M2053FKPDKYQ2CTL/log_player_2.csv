"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1000000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore a potentially lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he starts with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This signals his serious intent to negotiate. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  A lower counteroffer puts pressure on Alice to compromise, but it's not so low that it's immediately unreasonable.  There's room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Staying within Budget:** This counteroffer keeps Bob comfortably within his maximum budget of $1,200,000."
