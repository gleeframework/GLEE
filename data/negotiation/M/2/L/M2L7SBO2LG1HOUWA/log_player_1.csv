Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $12,000. I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly.
* **Creating Value Perception:** By mentioning a ""special price"" and highlighting the product's value to Bob, we aim to justify the price and make it more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While we want to maximize profit, we also want to avoid pushing Bob away. Offering it at $12,000 leaves a buffer. If Bob negotiates, we can still potentially sell it above our $10,000 guarantee from John. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Bob's response will dictate how we proceed in further negotiations."
