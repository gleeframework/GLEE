"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $16,000.  What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $16,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $13,000? That would be a much fairer deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still above my budget. I'm really keen on this product, but I can only offer $10,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $11,500 for it. This is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm prepared to offer $11,000. This would be a fair compromise, and we can both move forward with the deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
