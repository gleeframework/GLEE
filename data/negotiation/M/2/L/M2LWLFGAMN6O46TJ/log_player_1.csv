I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,750. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway, and hopefully encourages him to close the deal."

Bob's latest offer is only $500 less than my last counteroffer, and it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the deal."
