Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $150. I'm willing to consider a price of $120, which is still a bit above what I'm looking for. Can you meet me in the middle at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
