"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120.
* Alice's offer of $90 is better than John's price of $120, but there's still room for negotiation.
* By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is willing to sell for $80.
* I'm willing to pay up to $120. 
* This counteroffer of $85 is a good starting point to see if Alice will accept a price closer to her minimum.
* If she rejects this offer, I can always go back up to $90 or choose to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $92 is still better than buying from John at $120. 
* It's only slightly higher than my initial counteroffer of $85, so it's a reasonable compromise.
* I'm not sure I can get a lower price from Alice in future rounds, as she's already raised her price."
