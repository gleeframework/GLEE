Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves space for Bob to haggle or counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to your desired amount.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a great deal. If he rejects or counter-offers, you can adjust your approach. 

**Important:** This is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. You can always come down in price, especially knowing John will buy it for $12,000."
