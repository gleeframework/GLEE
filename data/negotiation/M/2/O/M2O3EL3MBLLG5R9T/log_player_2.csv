"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is already significantly lower than her stated value. This suggests there's room for negotiation. While $1,200,000 is a tempting price, it's worth seeing if you can get it for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counter:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($900,000) leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a polite and interested tone keeps the negotiation positive, even while pushing for a lower price. 
* **Avoiding Extremes:**  Jumping straight to the absolute lowest acceptable price might be too aggressive and could risk derailing the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. We've established she's willing to go lower than her initial offer, so it's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can reach a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so continuing to counter-offer is the best strategy.
* **Compromise:** Offering $1,025,000 shows a willingness to compromise and move closer to Alice's price while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Specific Number:** Using a specific number like $1,025,000 instead of a round number like $1,000,000 can sometimes make the offer seem more considered and serious."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I can meet you at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $1,075,000 is a substantial savings compared to John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **""Lowest I can go"":**  Alice's language suggests this is her final offer, and pushing further might risk her walking away from the deal.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but the potential savings might not be worth the additional time and effort."
