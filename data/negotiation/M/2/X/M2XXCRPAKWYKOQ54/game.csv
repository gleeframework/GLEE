"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $900,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you being willing to come down on your price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $900,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
