"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value. I'm open to further discussion if you're interested in exploring this offer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort we've put into it. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  $1100000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1000000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the effort we've put into it. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
