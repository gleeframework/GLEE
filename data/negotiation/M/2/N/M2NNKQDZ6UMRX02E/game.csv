"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we try for $75?  That seems like a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $90 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $90 is closer, but a bit tough for me. Would you do $80?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90, which would be $85. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,7,
