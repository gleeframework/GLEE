"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $250 is a bit out of my budget for this product. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,180.0
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $180, which is a good compromise. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $180 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $120. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll unfortunately have to look elsewhere.",120.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,200.0
"I'm not willing to go as low as $120, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer. I can do $190, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise. What do you think?",190.0,Alice,5,,
