"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both room to compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not convinced that $12500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $10000. How about $11250?,11250.0,Bob,4,
