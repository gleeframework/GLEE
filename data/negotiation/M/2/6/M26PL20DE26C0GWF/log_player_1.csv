Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $95 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about $105? It's still a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
I'm going to counter with $105, still above Bob's offer but closer to a compromise.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. I've been able to find another seller offering the product at $80 which fits my budget better. Thank you for considering my needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is far below my minimum acceptable value. While I could try to counter-offer again, there's no guarantee he'll budge further.  It's not worth risking losing time and potentially a better deal.  Selling to John for $120 ensures I meet my minimum price goal and avoids further negotiation."
