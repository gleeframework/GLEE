"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell the product to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive price, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay closer to $8,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $8,800. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $8,800 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $8,200?  This is a good deal for both of us and gets us closer to a final agreement.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,200. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I think $8,600 is a fair price considering the product's value. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's worth it. What do you think?",8600.0,Alice,5,
