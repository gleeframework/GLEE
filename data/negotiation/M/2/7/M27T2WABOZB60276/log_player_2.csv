This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Savings:** You'll be buying the product for $5 less than John's price.
* **Finality:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has a chance of getting a slightly better price, but also risks Alice backing out and forcing you to buy from John at full price."
