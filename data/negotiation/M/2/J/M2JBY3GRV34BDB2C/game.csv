"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, this is getting a bit frustrating.  Your last offer doesn't feel like much of a concession.  I'll offer you $10,250 and not a penny more.  Take it or leave it.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your final offer. However, I'm not willing to accept $10,250. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll counteroffer at $11,250. This is my absolute final price. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",11250.0,Alice,7,
