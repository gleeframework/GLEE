(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at her price.  Bob should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob should start by offering the lowest price he's willing to pay, which is the same as what John is selling the product for. This sets a clear boundary for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Bob should try to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price. While Alice's offer is getting closer to his desired price, there is still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

Bob should continue to try and meet in the middle. $950,000 is a reasonable compromise between his last offer and Alice's, showing he's willing to negotiate but not to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

Bob should continue to negotiate and meet Alice halfway. Offering $975,000 shows that he's serious about buying but is still trying to get a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,005,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget and the negotiation seems to be getting nowhere.  It's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John and save the time and effort of continuing to negotiate with Alice."
