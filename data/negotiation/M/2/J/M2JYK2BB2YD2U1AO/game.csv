"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a price that benefits us both. I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's talk!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Could we work something out closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,150,000? This price still offers you a significant value while allowing me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower. How about $1,075,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,112,500.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. What do you say?",1112500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close!  I'm willing to go up a bit, how about $1,093,750?  That's right in between our last two offers.",1093750.0,Bob,6,
