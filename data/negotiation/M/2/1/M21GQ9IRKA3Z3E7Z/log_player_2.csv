"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's mutually beneficial.  I'm asking $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its potential value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $1,000,000.
* Alice is asking $900,000.
* John will sell it to you for $1,000,000.

Rejecting Alice's offer means you can buy the product from John for the same price you value it at. This is the best possible outcome as you won't lose any money."
