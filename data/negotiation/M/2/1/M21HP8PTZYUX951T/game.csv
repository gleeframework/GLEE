"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know if you're willing to go lower.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $175. It's a great compromise, if I do say so myself!",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $150? That's a fair compromise, and I'm really keen on getting this product.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a great offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $165. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal!",165.0,Alice,5,
