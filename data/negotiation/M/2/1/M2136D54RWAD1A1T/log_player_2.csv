"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $1,150,000 from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer yet.  Rejecting the offer opens the possibility of getting a lower price from Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This would be a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. To be fair to both of us, I could consider coming down to $1,125,000. This reflects the true worth of the product and its potential benefits for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You're still hoping to get closer to your ideal price of $1,050,000.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and potentially allows you to get a better deal."
