Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting the negotiation with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation but still aims for a significant profit.
* **Justification:**  While I don't explicitly state the product's worth to Bob, framing it as ""incredibly valuable"" subtly hints that I'm aware of its significance to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By stating this is an ""initial price,"" I signal my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Safety Net:** I have John as a backup who will pay my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This would be a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While $1,050,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). There's a lot of room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** By rejecting Bob's offer and countering, I can try to steer the price closer to his perceived value. 
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing I have John as a backup gives me leverage in the negotiation. Bob is clearly interested, so I'm willing to risk one round of counter-offers to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. To be fair to both of us, I could consider coming down to $1,125,000. This reflects the true worth of the product and its potential benefits for you."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer by a significant margin ($25,000) to show flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's worth, subtly reminding Bob of its potential and justifying the higher price. 
* **Maintaining Firmness:** I'm not dropping my price too drastically, signaling that I believe in the product's value and am seeking a fair deal.  
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps me well above my safety net ($1,000,000 from John), preserving the potential for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,125,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Reaching a Limit:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher. He's shown a willingness to negotiate, but his counteroffers have been consistently below my initial target.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation further carries the risk of Bob losing interest or finding an alternative.  
* **Securing the Deal:**  It's better to secure a strong profit now rather than risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for a marginally higher price."
