Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob before moving to your backup offer.

**Strategy**

Aim high, but within reason.  Bob is more likely to accept an offer that feels like a good deal to him, even if it's very profitable for you. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creates a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Value-Focused:** Highlights the product's benefits instead of just the price.
* **Strong Price:** $1,350,000 is a significant profit for you while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($150,000 less than his valuation).

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob could reject the offer and try to negotiate lower.  Be prepared to slightly adjust your price if necessary, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum."
