"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $950,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this is a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $1,012,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1012500.0,Bob,4,
