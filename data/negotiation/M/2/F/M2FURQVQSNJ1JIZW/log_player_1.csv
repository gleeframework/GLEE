{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.  It also sets a high starting point, giving me leverage.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and below the price I can get from John.  I'm not willing to settle for that amount yet.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let's find a middle ground and make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still above Bob's latest offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price. How about $8,900? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 8900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. How about $8,750 again, or I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and his threat to buy from John for $8,000 is not a credible threat (since John is actually willing to pay $10,000). It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  I'm better off selling to John for $10,000 and guaranteeing myself a good profit."
