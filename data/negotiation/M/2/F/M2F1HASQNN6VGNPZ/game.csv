"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really like the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. $130 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $125?  It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your point, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to make one more concession, how about $135?",135.0,Alice,5,
