"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $150. It's a fair price considering the value it brings.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However, $150 is still a bit out of my range.  I'd be happy to pay $125 for it.  That's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $135. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $135 is closer, but I'm still at my limit. If you're willing to come down to $120, I'll take it. Otherwise, I'm going to have to go with another offer.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise.",130.0,Alice,7,
