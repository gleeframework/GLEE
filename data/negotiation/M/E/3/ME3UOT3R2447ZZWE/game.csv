"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering what it's worth to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is a strong offer, the product's value to me is quite high.  I could consider letting it go for $1,700,000.  This reflects a willingness to meet you halfway.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
