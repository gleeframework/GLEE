"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs and expectations. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $12,000 for it. This price reflects not only its market value but also the significant discount compared to other potential buyers. I trust this offer will meet your budget considerations while securing a fair deal for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is a discount, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for $10,000, saving $2,000."
