"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
