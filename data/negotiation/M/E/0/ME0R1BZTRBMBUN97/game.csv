"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $16000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to offer $14000.  If you can't go that low, maybe we can split the difference.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $15000. I'm willing to split the difference again and offer you the product for $14750. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",14750.0,Alice,7,
