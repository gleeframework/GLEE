Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product for $9,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $10,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum value ($10,000) maximizes the chance he'll accept while ensuring you make a significant profit. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, so there's no risk of losing money.

By starting high, you leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
