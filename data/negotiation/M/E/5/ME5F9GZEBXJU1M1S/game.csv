"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value, I'm willing to pay $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $8,750. It's a good middle ground and hopefully allows us to make a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
