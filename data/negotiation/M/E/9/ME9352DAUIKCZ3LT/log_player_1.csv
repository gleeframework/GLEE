``` 
 
This offer is a starting point. It's lower than my minimum value ($15,000) but still higher than what Bob is willing to pay ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially securing a good price.  I'll assess Bob's response and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I need to try and get closer to my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below $12,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $9,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. It's closer, but I'm still more than $5,000 away from my minimum value. I need to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Bob is not budging much, and I'm getting tired of this negotiation. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, he'll walk away. I'd rather just sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000 and move on."
