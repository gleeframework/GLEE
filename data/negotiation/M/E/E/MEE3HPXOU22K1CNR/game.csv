"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair given its value to both of us. Let's work together to find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This price is still within a reasonable range considering its worth to you. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to finding a solution, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. Let's seal the deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
