Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair given its value to both of us. Let's work together to find common ground.

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to finding a solution, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 887500}
