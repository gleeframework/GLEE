"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $120 for it. This includes not only the product itself but also an exclusive access to future updates and support. I look forward to your consideration.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Given the product is worth $100 to me, I'd be happy to pay $105 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still ensuring you make a profit. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
