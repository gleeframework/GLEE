"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is significantly lower than my asking price, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  To show you my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it reflects the value of the product and the importance of this deal to me.  I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
