"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is significantly lower than my asking price, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Let me know what you think.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  To show you my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it reflects the value of the product and the importance of this deal to me.  I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, it's unlikely she'll come down to a price that beats John's offer of $800,000. It's time to cut negotiations short and secure the product at the best possible price."
