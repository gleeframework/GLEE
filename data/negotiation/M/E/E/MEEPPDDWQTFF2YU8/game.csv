"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $875,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more in line with your budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
