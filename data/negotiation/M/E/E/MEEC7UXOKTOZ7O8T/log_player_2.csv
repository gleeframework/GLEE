Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $140. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $140.  While you *might* be able to negotiate her down further, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price. John offers a guaranteed price of $150, which is better than continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point."
