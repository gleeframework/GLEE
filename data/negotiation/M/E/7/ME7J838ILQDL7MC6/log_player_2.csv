Alice's offer is still too high, but we're getting closer. Rejecting her offer allows us to continue negotiating and hopefully get a better price."

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than I'd like, but it's close enough to my limit. It's better to accept this offer rather than risk going back and forth with Alice further and potentially ending up paying more or having to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
