"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think the product's value is higher than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's see if we can make it work.",980000.0,Alice,5,
