Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  Bob values the product at $1,200,000 so he has incentive to negotiate.  I'm open to counteroffers and will assess them based on how close they are to my desired outcome and how confident I feel about selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a good price, it's still a bit below my target.  I want to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000 through further negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a price that's closer to my goal. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $960,000.  While it's not the ideal price, it's very close to my target and I'm worried about continuing to negotiate and potentially losing Bob as a buyer altogether. At this point, the risk of losing out on a sale to John for $800,000 is too high.  $960,000 is a strong outcome."
