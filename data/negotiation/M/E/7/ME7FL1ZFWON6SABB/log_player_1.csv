Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a good deal before I open up the opportunity to other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than John's guaranteed offer. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of potential value. 
* **Justification:**  I provide a reason for the high price (""fair reflection of its worth"") without overselling the product itself. 
* **Urgency:**  I subtly introduce a sense of urgency by mentioning ""other interested parties"" (John) to encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Goal:**

The aim is to secure a price significantly higher than Bob's $800,000 valuation while staying below my guaranteed sale price to John. Ideally, I want Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal even if he negotiates the price down somewhat."
