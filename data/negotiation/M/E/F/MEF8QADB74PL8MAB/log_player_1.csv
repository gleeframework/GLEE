"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's a fair price:**  It's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It shows confidence:** It's not a lowball offer, suggesting I believe in the value of the product.
* **It opens the door for conversation:** It invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's tempting to take the $8,000, I can do better. I know the product is worth more to Bob, and there are still rounds left to negotiate. 
* **Rejecting sets the stage for a counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate and I'm willing to continue negotiating. This increases the chances of getting a better price. 
* **I haven't used all my negotiation rounds:**  I still have 8 rounds left to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with a Reason:** Instead of simply rejecting Bob's offer, I provide a counteroffer with a clear message that shows I'm willing to compromise, but still value the product.
* **Meeting Halfway:** The $9,000 price is a midpoint between my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,000).
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for future negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's higher than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum. I know the product is worth more to Bob.
* **More negotiation rounds available.**  We still have 6 rounds left to negotiate. I'm not in a rush to sell the product at this price.
* **Selling to John would result in a lower profit.** The goal is to maximize profit, and selling to John would be less profitable than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  Let's try $9,500.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Again):** The offer of $9,500 is the midpoint between my previous offer ($9,000) and Bob's latest offer ($8,500). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value, emphasizing that my offer is fair and reflects its worth.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  By making a counter-offer that shows a willingness to negotiate, I'm indicating that I'm open to a deal, but not at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to pay $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is within my acceptable range.**  $9,000 is above my minimum of $8,000, meaning I'll make a profit.
* **We're nearing the end of the negotiation.**  We have only 4 rounds left, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or a lower price.
* **Risk of losing the deal.** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a chance we won't reach an agreement, and I might be forced to sell to John for a lower price. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a profitable deal within a reasonable timeframe."
