"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the price, I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
