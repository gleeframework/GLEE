"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $120 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything higher than that.  Since Alice's offer is $100, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $90, which is still below my maximum price of $120 and a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This should make it worthwhile for Alice to consider while still allowing me to save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $110, which is still below my maximum price of $120.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely she won't go lower than $110.  It's better to accept her offer and secure the product at a price that's still favorable to me."
