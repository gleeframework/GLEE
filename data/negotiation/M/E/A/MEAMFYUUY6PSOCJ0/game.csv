"Hi Alice,  $19,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  To make this work, I could come down to $17,000. This is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $17,000, but I'm still a bit outside my comfort zone. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500?  That's a significant drop from your initial offer and closer to what I can afford.",13500.0,Bob,4,
