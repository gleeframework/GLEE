"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. Given its value, I'm offering it at $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $19,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  To make this work, I could come down to $17,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $17,000, but I'm still a bit outside my comfort zone. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500?  That's a significant drop from your initial offer and closer to what I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, his offer is still significantly below my minimum. Waiting any longer with the risk of him dropping out completely is not worth losing the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
