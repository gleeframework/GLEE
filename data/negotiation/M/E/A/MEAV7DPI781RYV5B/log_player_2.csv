"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this high-quality product, valued at $15,000 to you. I'm willing to let you have it for $14,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John.  It's always worth seeing if Alice might go lower. There's a chance to save $1,000 by rejecting this offer and seeing if Alice will counter with a better price."
