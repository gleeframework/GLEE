"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $200.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my ideal.  However, I'm aware that Bob is only willing to pay $150, so if he rejects my offer, I'll need to be prepared to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $175 is better than my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I'm already in round 2. It's unlikely I'll get a better offer, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds."
