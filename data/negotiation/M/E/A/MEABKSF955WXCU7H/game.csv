"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a competitive price, and I get to sell it quickly.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1000000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering your value and my limit. Let's make this deal work!",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $925000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget. Let's make this happen!",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $900000. This is a good compromise, and it's the highest I can go. Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Bob,4,
