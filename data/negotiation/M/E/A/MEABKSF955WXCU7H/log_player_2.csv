"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a competitive price, and I get to sell it quickly.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering your value and my limit. Let's make this deal work!"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $925000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's preferred price point.  There's room for further negotiation, especially since Bob can always walk away and buy from John for $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a more favorable price."
