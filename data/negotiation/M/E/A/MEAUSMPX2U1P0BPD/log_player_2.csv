Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot on the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'll meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go.

Alice is unlikely to go below $13,000. It's better to secure the product from John at $12,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
