Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the potential benefit for Bob to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm also emphasizing that this is a fair price and urging Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $107.50? That's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price, but I'm still keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107.50 is just not feasible for me. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? This is a fair compromise and a good price for both of us.  Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

I'm still trying to get closer to my target price, but I'm also trying to be reasonable and show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping to close the deal in this round."
