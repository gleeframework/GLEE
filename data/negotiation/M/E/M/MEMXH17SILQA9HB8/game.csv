"Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested, but $9500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to pay $8500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8500. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $9000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8750?  That feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $8750.
