"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $950,000 is unfortunately below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the product's worth. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the product's value, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"You're right, Bob, finding a fair compromise is important. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,080,000. This product represents a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will deliver significant value to your business.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your confidence in the product's value, Alice, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,080,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,060,000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's potential benefits.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
