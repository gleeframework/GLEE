"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This is a high starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I want to maximize my profits while still keeping the deal appealing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to stay above that threshold to make this deal worthwhile.  Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a price that's more in line with my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's initial offer, which might make him more likely to accept.  It's also a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can get a better offer from Bob, or at least get closer to my goal.  Rejecting this offer gives me another round to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $825,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on my goal of getting at least $800,000. It's a good midpoint between my last offer and Bob's current one, increasing the chances of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $775,000 is getting closer to my goal, I'm still determined to get at least $800,000.  It's only round 6, and I have a few more rounds to try and get a better deal from Bob.  I'm not willing to settle for anything less than my minimum price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $800,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me at this price.  If he doesn't, I'll move on to John and secure a guaranteed sale."
