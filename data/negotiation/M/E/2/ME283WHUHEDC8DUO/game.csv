"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $12,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,250.  How about we split the difference at $11,625?  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both walk away happy.",11625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've come down quite a bit, and I appreciate that.  To be honest,  $11,400 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.",11400.0,Bob,6,
