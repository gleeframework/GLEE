"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $13,250? This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $12,500 was a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $13,250, which would be $12,875. Can you consider that?",12875.0,Bob,4,
