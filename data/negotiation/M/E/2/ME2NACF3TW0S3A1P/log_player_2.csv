You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. Buying from John is always an option, but you should try to get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to start with a reasonable offer, but also to be prepared to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is closer to your budget, it's still a bit higher than what you are willing to pay. You should try to negotiate further and see if you can get Alice to come down even more. You can always buy from John as a fallback option, but you should try to get the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows that you're willing to negotiate but are also serious about getting the product at a price you're comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much, and her last offer is still above your budget. It's clear that you won't be able to get the product for less than $15,000 from Alice. Since you have a guaranteed deal with John for $10,000, it's the best option to buy from him."
