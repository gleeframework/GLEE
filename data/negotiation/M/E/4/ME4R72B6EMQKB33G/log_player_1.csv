"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $700,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that drastic of a price drop.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price and see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our initial offers.  How about $775,000? This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, but $775,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $725,000, which I think is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who's willing to pay that amount.  

Rejecting this offer gives me another opportunity to counter and hopefully reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $725,000 is still too far off from my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $750,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $725,000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is not willing to budge on his offer of $725,000, which is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Rather than continue to negotiate and risk losing more time, I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, John is a guaranteed buyer and will pay my minimum asking price.  It's important to prioritize a secure sale over potentially prolonged negotiations that may not result in a favorable outcome."
