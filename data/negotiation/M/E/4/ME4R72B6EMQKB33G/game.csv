"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our initial offers.  How about $775,000? This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns.",775000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, but $775,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $725,000, which I think is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",725000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $725,000 is still too far off from my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $750,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $725,000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",725000.0,Bob,6,,
