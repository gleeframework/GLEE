"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe could be a game-changer for your business. I'm confident that its worth to you exceeds $800000, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its true potential. I'm asking for $900000. This price reflects a significant discount from what I believe it's truly worth.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,
