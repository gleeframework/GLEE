"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's above your maximum budget of $800,000. You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. This price is within my budget, and it represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, however,  $850,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and the benefits it can bring. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This represents a significant reduction on my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still too high.  $1,050,000 is still above your budget.  You should continue negotiating and see if you can reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still beyond what I can realistically pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and a substantial savings for you compared to your initial offer. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000 as a final attempt to make this work. I believe this offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still above your maximum budget. You can continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to your desired price. It's worth pushing for a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,025,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm offering a final price of $975,000. This represents a considerable discount from your initial offer and is the highest I can go while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
