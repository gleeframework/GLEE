"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,250 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $9,250?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250

I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. Let's compromise at $9,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's still well within your budget."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. How about $9,500?  That's a solid offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and while I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $9,500 is a good deal considering I can always sell to John for $8,000. Accepting Bob's offer is the most financially sensible choice."
