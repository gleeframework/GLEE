Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.**  This ensures I'm still making a substantial profit.
* **It's lower than the product's worth to Bob ($15,000).** This gives Bob a clear incentive to negotiate and potentially reach an agreement that benefits both of us.

By offering a price lower than Bob's perceived value, I'm hoping to encourage him to accept the offer. However, I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it, knowing that I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is higher than what John would pay, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I believe I can do better.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Continue negotiations:** I have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $12,000.
* **Maintain leverage:** By showing I'm not desperate for a quick sale, I keep Bob motivated to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

The risk of selling to John for $8,000 is still there, but I'm willing to take that risk in hopes of getting a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000.  This is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Lower than my initial offer:** This acknowledges Bob's counteroffer while still allowing me to earn a decent profit.

This counteroffer allows me to:

* **Potentially secure a favorable deal:** Bob might accept this offer, as it's still a good value for him.
* **Maintain pressure:** If Bob rejects, I can consider lowering the price slightly further, but I'm still in a good position to negotiate. 

I'm confident this counteroffer will lead to a successful negotiation, but I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
