Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but lower than my minimum acceptable price.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I want for the product.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's not quite there yet.  I'm not willing to risk going another round with Bob and potentially ending up with an even lower price. John is offering my minimum acceptable price, so it's a sure thing and I'm going to take it."
