Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his ideal price of $10,000. There's still room for negotiation, and he should try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay at $10,000.  If you're not able to go that low, let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to stay at $10000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above his maximum price of $10,000. He can get the product for the same price from John, making it the most logical choice in this situation."
