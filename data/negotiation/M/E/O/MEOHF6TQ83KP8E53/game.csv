"That's a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. What do you think?"
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for such a great product.",12500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While I'm really keen on this product, $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $10,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $11,250. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price for the product."
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $10,000.  It's the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",10000.0,Bob,6,,
