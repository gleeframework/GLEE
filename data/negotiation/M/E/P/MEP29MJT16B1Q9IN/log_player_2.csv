"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its features and potential. I'm asking for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still above my desired target of $15,000. There's room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $13,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible. I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see how Alice reacts. $10,000 is a fair starting point, considering my budget and her likely bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to my target than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit high. I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll counteroffer again and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering to meet Alice halfway again, this time at $10,750. This is still within my budget, but hopefully close enough to Alice's desired price to get a deal done."
