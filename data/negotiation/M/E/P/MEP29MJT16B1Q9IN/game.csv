"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $13,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
