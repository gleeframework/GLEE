# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999.  I believe it offers excellent value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is very close to her valuation, leaving little room for negotiation. Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, it makes more financial sense to buy it from him and save the $1,999."
