``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000, giving you room to negotiate downward if Bob makes a counteroffer.  It also includes a friendly and encouraging message to Bob to entice him to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget of $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer as it's better than nothing, I'm confident I can do better. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my preferred value."

Bob's offer:
