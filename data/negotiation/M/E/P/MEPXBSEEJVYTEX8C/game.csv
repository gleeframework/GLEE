"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget of $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,250, which is a fair compromise. This price is still within your budget, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
