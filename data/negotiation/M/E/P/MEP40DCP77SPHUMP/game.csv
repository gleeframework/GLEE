"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite low for what this product offers.  Would you consider $11,000? It's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $11,000 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
