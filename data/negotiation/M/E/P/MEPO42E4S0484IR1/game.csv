"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Its value speaks for itself, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,300,000.  Given its potential, I believe it's a very fair starting point for our discussion.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to make an investment in the 600,000 dollar range. Would that be feasible?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. To be frank, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price was already taking that into account.  Could you consider something closer to $1,100,000? I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product is valuable to you, and I'm serious about making a deal.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one? Would $850,000 be agreeable?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, we both see the value in this product. Let's find a middle ground - how about $975,000?  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $900,000 to get this deal done today.  That's a significant investment on my part, and I'm hoping you'll see it as a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,6,
