Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to make an investment in the 600,000 dollar range. Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. To be frank, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price was already taking that into account.  Could you consider something closer to $1,100,000? I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable to you, and I'm serious about making a deal.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one? Would $850,000 be agreeable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $850,000 is a significant amount, we are still in early rounds. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. Holding out for a higher offer, closer to $1,000,000, is a good strategy at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we both see the value in this product. Let's find a middle ground - how about $975,000?  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $900,000 to get this deal done today.  That's a significant investment on my part, and I'm hoping you'll see it as a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $900,000 is a strong offer. While selling to John would net us $1,000,000, continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer or stalling. Accepting $900,000 now is a good compromise to secure a sizable profit."
