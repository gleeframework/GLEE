"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'd be willing to make a deal at that price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm open to negotiating, $10000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10750?  This still gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen!",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we try $10500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
