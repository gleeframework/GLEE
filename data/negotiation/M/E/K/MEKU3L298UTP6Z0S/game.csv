"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $13,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference and meet at $11,500? That feels like a fair deal to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close the deal. ",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000.  Would you consider $11,750? It's a small step, but it could be the final one to reach a deal.",11750.0,Bob,6,
