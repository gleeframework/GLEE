"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a competitive price of $15000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle somewhere.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget for the product, but I'm still a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $13500. This is a fair price that should work for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12800, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that price?",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12800 is still a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $13500. However, if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to a different buyer.",13500.0,Alice,5,
