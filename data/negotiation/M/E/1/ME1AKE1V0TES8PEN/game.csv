"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the exclusivity and the potential value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to spend. How about $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1700000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and exclusivity.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, based on my current budget and financial considerations, I am unable to agree to $1700000. I am prepared to offer $1600000. This seems to be a reasonable midpoint between our positions.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that fits your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1600000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $1650000? I think it's a reasonable price that reflects the product's value and exclusivity.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've considered your latest proposal, Alice, and while I understand the value of the product and your desire to maintain a profit margin, I believe $1650000 is still slightly above my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $1625000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering both our positions.",1625000.0,Bob,6,
