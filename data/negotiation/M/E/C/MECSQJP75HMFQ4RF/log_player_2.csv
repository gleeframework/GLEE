"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a maximum budget of $1,200,000, and Alice's offer of $900,000 is within that range. However, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  There is still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  A counteroffer of $750,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. This price is likely to be attractive to Alice, as it is still significantly higher than her value of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is higher than Bob's previous offer of $750,000 and closer to her initial asking price.  While still within Bob's budget, it's not a significant enough price reduction to make it worthwhile for him.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price. There is still potential to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to her initial price point. Bob's counteroffer of $825,000 is a compromise. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still allows for a profit for Alice, as it's above her value of $800,000.  This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate and provides a strong starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is only slightly lower than her initial offer.  This suggests she is not willing to budge much further.  Given that Bob is already close to his maximum budget and the negotiation seems to be reaching a stalemate, it is more advantageous for him to buy the product from John for $1,200,000. Although it's not the best price, it guarantees a purchase and avoids further negotiation."
