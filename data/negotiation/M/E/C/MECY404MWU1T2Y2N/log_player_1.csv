"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm still losing money. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering a price halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer.  This shows good faith and willingness to compromise, but it still ensures I make a profit."
