,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again at $935,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.",935000.0,Alice,5,
