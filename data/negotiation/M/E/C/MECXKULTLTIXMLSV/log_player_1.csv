``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially motivates Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.  I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my last offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again at $935,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 935000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still think I can get a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away from this deal, but I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $910,000? That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm starting to run out of time.  Since I'm only two rounds away from being unable to sell to John, I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal with Bob."
