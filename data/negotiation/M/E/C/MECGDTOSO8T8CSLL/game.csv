"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand it's a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $140? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $125 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $135? It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",135.0,Alice,7,
