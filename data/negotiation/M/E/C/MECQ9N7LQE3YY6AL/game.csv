"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. I know it's a premium price, but I'm confident it's worth it considering its value. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of your product, I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. How about we consider the product priced at $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1400000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This reflects the product's unique value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1600000. This offers a fair compromise between the product's worth and my financial situation.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1600000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle at $1650000.  This price acknowledges the product's value while also recognizing your budget constraints. It's a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're making progress here. Considering the value of the product and aiming for a fair price, I'd like to suggest a price of $1625000. This proposal aims to find a middle ground that respects the product's worth while aligning better with my budget.",1625000.0,Bob,6,
