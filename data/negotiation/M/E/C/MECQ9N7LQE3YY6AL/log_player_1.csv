"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I know it's a premium price, but I'm confident it's worth it considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Opening Offer:** Starting high allows for negotiation room and establishes a strong starting point.
* **Reasoning:**  I provide a reason for the high price, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially counteroffer."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,600,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,650,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000).**
