"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground.",800000.0,Alice,3,
