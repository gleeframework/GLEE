"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $22,000 to start.  What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $18,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $20,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $19,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",19000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $19,000 is close, but I need to get at least $19,500 for this to make sense on my end.  Would you be able to do $19,500?",19500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $19,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $19,000 and $19,500. Can I get it for $19,250?",19250.0,Bob,6,
