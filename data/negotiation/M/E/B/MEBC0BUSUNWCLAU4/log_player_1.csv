Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $95. I believe you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $100, offering it at $95 leaves room for profit while still being attractive to Bob. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Space:**  While aiming high, the offer isn't ridiculously above Bob's perceived value. This leaves a slight buffer if Bob attempts to negotiate the price down.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out completely."
