"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique and exclusive item that will bring a lot of value to you. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer is better than her previous one, but still too high for me. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is a good deal. While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that she'll walk away or I'll end up paying more. It's a good compromise and saves me $250,000 compared to buying from John."
