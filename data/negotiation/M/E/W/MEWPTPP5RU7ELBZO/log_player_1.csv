"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
I'm starting with my highest price point, knowing I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John. This sets the stage for negotiation and hopefully compels Bob to consider a higher offer than he initially envisioned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to counter with a more reasonable price in the next round. Selling to John is always an option, but I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still remaining above Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiation position. I'm hoping this encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has moved slightly closer to my desired price, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm prepared to sell to John if we don't reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price.  This counteroffer shows that I'm flexible and willing to work with Bob, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth."
