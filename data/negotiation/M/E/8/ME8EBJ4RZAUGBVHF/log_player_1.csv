"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price."

While I'd love to get closer to $12,000, $11,500 is still a good deal for me, and it's  very likely Bob won't budge further.  It's time to close the deal."
