"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000.  This is a significant discount from my original price, and it's a price that's still fair given the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?  This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to compromise.  To make this deal work, I need to stick to my minimum asking price of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, and it's a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere.  I'm confident the product will be worth every penny to you.  Let me know if you're ready to accept.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
