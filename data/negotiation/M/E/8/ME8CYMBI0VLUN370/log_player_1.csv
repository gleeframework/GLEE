"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but lower than John's offer. This gives me room to negotiate while still prioritizing a high sale price.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to me, hoping to subtly imply its higher worth and justify the asking price.
* **Inviting Response:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider a reasonable price.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I have several rounds remaining, so there's potential to secure a higher price by continuing negotiations.
* **Exploring Potential Higher Offers:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore if he's willing to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000.  This is a significant discount from my original price, and it's a price that's still fair given the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Not Too Much:**  I've reduced my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  However, this price is still above my minimum and closer to my ideal outcome.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using language like ""work together"" and ""find a solution"" to create a more collaborative tone.  This could make Bob more receptive to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've thought about it, and I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** However, I believe there's still potential for him to increase his offer further.  He acknowledges that he may not be able to go higher, but it's worth testing if he's willing to compromise further.
* **Limited Rounds:**  While I have a few rounds left, it's important to be strategic.  I don't want to risk losing out on a better price by accepting too soon. 

By rejecting, I can see if Bob will budge further, or if I should consider selling to John in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?  This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm making it clear that I'm serious about this price and won't go any lower.  However, I'm also being reasonable by meeting him halfway from my previous offer.
* **Finality:** I'm explicitly stating this is my ""final offer,"" creating a sense of urgency and potentially pushing Bob to make a decision.
* **Alternative Options:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Bob of my alternative buyer (John), increasing the pressure on him to accept.

This approach aims to find a middle ground while maintaining a sense of finality to potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Almost There:** Bob's offer is only $10,000 away from my minimum acceptable price, and with limited rounds left, it's tempting to accept. 
* **Negotiating Power:**  However, I've already established that I'm willing to negotiate and shown flexibility.  There's a good chance Bob could be persuaded to go the final $10,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  By rejecting, I risk losing out on a sale close to my minimum. However, the potential reward of securing the full $1,000,000 is worth the gamble, especially with several rounds remaining.

I'm going to counter with my minimum price to see if Bob will finally accept.  If he doesn't, I can always fall back on selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to compromise.  To make this deal work, I need to stick to my minimum asking price of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, and it's a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere.  I'm confident the product will be worth every penny to you.  Let me know if you're ready to accept."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:** I'm sticking to my minimum price, making it clear that this is my final offer.  
* **Highlighting Value & Opportunity:** I emphasize the product's worth and the potential benefits Bob will gain. This could help sway him to accept.
* **Closing the Deal:** By framing the message as a question (""Let me know if you're ready to accept""), I'm directly prompting Bob to make a decision. 

This approach aims to increase the pressure on Bob and potentially secure the full $1,000,000, while also leaving the door open for a deal to be made."
