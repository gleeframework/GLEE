"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a starting price of $20,000. I believe it offers tremendous value, even at this price point. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. That price is a bit too high for my budget though. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. ",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand the product has value, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. Could you meet me halfway at $10,000? That's the highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. Let's make this happen - how about $14,000? That's my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
