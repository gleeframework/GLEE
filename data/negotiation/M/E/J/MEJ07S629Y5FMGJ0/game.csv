"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's within a more reasonable range. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. While $2,300,000 represents its full potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer you $900,000.  If that's not workable, I might have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,500,000 to reflect the product's true value. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. How about $1,100,000?  That's a substantial offer and demonstrates my serious interest.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, but I can't go any lower than that. This is a final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
