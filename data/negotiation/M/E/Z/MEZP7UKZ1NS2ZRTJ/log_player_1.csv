"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a bit above my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, but it's still a good starting point to see what he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$120 is too low for me. I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I will counter offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
