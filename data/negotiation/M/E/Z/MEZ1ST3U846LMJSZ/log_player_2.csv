Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to negotiate with Alice. He needs to make a final counteroffer that is both attractive to Alice and within his budget.  

* **Why 1,075,000?**  This is a significant compromise from Bob's previous offer, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  It's also below his maximum of $1,000,000, which is a risk, but calculated. 

* **Why take the risk?**  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can always buy from John for $1,000,000.  This final counteroffer is a gamble to see if he can get a better deal.  He's hoping Alice will see the value in closing the deal and accept this price."
