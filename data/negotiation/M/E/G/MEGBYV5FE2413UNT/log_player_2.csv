"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

It's not worth paying $9,000 when you have a better option with John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what John is offering. It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John."
