"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm happy to buy it for $7,500. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
