Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals and Bob's potential valuation:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm suggesting a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a final price higher than $10,000 (John's offer).
* **Time Value and Certainty:**  Selling to Bob quickly and directly avoids the potential hassle and uncertainty of waiting for John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay above $10,000."
