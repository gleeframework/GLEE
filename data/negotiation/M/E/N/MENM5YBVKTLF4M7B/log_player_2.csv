Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you have other options and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,050,000. It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
