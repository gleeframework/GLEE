"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds immense value, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for you.  While I can't disclose the exact details just yet, I assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a significant discount from what I believe the true value to be.  Please consider this offer carefully, as I have another interested buyer ready to pay $1000000 if you decline.
