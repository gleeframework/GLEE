"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. I'm thinking closer to $850,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $1,100,000 is still pushing it for me. How about we settle at $950,000?  That's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $950,000 is closer to a fair price, I can't accept less than $1,025,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
