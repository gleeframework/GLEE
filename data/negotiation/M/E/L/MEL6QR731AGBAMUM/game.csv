"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from your offer. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,150. This would be a great compromise, and still allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",10150.0,Alice,5,
