"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be fair to propose a price of $11,500 for this valuable item.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product.  This seems like a fair compromise given the value of the product and our respective needs."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose a price of $10,875 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value we both place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already made several counteroffers and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  $10,875 is a good price for Bob, saving him $1,125 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk of Alice walking away, or the negotiation dragging on too long. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price without risking further delay."
