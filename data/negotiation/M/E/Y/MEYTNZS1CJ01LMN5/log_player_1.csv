"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price, but one that is still within a reasonable range for Bob to consider. I want to see if he's willing to pay a significant portion of the value he sees in the product.  This gives us room to negotiate downwards if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell at his price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price,  $9,500 is still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I am going to reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm further reducing my price, but I'm still aiming for a price that is more advantageous to me. I'm hoping that Bob sees that I'm willing to negotiate and will consider a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Bob is clearly not willing to budge significantly from his price, and while $9,000 is a decent offer, it's still far from my desired price. Rather than risk ending up with a price that's too low, I'm going to take the guaranteed offer from John and sell the product for $15,000."
