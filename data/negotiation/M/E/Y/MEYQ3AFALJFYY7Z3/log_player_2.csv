"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which is worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but not so low that it seems insulting or unreasonable. 
* **Sets a clear benchmark:** This counteroffer establishes Bob's willingness to negotiate and provides a starting point for further discussion. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  There's room for both parties to move towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $8250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price point. He wants to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000, but I need to stay within my budget.  Is that something you can work with?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the limit:** This counteroffer is very close to Bob's maximum budget, showing a serious commitment to buying the product.
* **Direct and clear:** It's a straightforward offer that avoids ambiguity and leaves no room for misinterpretations.
* **Emphasis on budget:**  The message highlights Bob's budget constraints to put pressure on Alice."
