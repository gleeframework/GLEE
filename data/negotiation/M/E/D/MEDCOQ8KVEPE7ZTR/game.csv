"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is reflective of the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the market value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  I believe this price still reflects the true worth of this product and its potential to exceed your initial investment.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,950,000 is a respectable offer, I'm still seeking something closer to my initial valuation. Let's settle at $2,025,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the inherent value of this product.",2025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm afraid $2,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,800,000, as I mentioned earlier. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm not willing to go any higher.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
