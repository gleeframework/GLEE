Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value and the existence of other interested parties, creating a sense of urgency and potential competition.
* **Room for negotiation:** While the initial price is ambitious, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he finds it too high.  

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still keeping Bob engaged."
