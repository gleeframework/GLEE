Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $175 is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to me and leaving room for a compromise with Bob. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to start the negotiation on a good note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $80. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob is likely not willing to pay much more, there's still room for negotiation.  
* **Selling to John is an option:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $125? It's a good price point for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair Price:** $125 is a reasonable price considering my minimum value and Bob's budget. 
* **Positive Tone:** I continue the conversation with a positive tone, emphasizing a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still aiming to keep my spending under $80. Could you possibly meet me at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable value of $150. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Accepting Bob's offer might lead to him continuing to negotiate downwards.
* **Guaranteed alternative:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $150. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $100 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $135. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my need to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while remaining above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Fair and reasonable:** $135 allows for a reasonable profit for me while remaining within Bob's negotiation range.
* **Encouraging tone:** The message maintains a positive tone, emphasizing a fair deal for both parties."
