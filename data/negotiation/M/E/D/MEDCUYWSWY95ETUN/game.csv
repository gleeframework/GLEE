"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $80. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $125? It's a good price point for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still aiming to keep my spending under $80. Could you possibly meet me at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $100 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $135. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my need to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
