"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, though.  How about $15,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $14,750? I think that's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",14750.0,Bob,4,
