Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $90 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to get a higher price. It's important to start the negotiation with a message that is friendly and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer for the product. I am willing to pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer of $85 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a sale to John at $80."
