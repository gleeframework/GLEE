"Alice,  while I appreciate the offer, $1500000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this time. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1100000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1150000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
