"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. I believe its value goes beyond $150, but considering your perspective, I'm willing to start the negotiation at $120. Let me know if this is something you're interested in exploring further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as cheap as possible, ideally under $80.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $120 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, given its potential benefits to my business. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of that, I would like to propose an offer of $95 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects both the value of the product and your financial considerations. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to try and get closer to his target price of $80. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. Given the product's value and my budget, I'm comfortable offering $90.  I believe this price reflects a fair balance for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value and your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am proposing a final offer of $92 for the product. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while ensuring you receive a fair value for your business needs. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget of $80.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially get a lower price, but there's a risk of Alice rejecting further offers or the deal falling apart. 

Since John is offering the product for $80, it's a guaranteed deal that aligns with Bob's budget. It's more advantageous to buy from John and ensure a deal at a price that's most favorable to Bob."
