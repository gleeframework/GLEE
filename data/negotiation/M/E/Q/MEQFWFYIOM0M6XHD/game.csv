"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay the full $1,000,000.  Think it over and let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
