"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $700,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price that better reflects the true value of this product. Let's meet halfway - how about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $900,000 is still outside of my budget. Let's compromise again. I'm willing to go up to $750,000. It's a significant offer, and I believe it's fair considering the product's worth to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $850,000 is closer to my range, I'm still aiming for a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is my final offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
