"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a price that's beneficial for you, and I can move this product quickly. Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 to make this worthwhile.  I believe this is still a fair price, and it allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to make this happen!",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and my budget. What do you think?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,125,000 is closer to what I need, I'm still a bit short of my target. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,137,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.  What do you think?",1137500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're close, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and my budget. What do you think?",1125000.0,Bob,6,
