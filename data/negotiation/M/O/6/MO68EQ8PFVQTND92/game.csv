"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,300,000 might seem high initially, I think the long-term benefits outweigh the upfront cost. To find some middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true value of this product. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still not workable for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. However, that's the best I can do. If you're not interested, I'll need to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I have to be realistic about the product's value.  I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This is my final offer. I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the significant potential this product offers.  Please let me know your decision.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
