Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response will tell us if he's really interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no risk of losing money by starting with a higher offer to Bob."
