"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. While $1,000,000 is better, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
