Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $127. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiations with Bob are not yielding any significant progress. Bob's offer of $127 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I've already made multiple concessions, it seems unlikely that Bob will budge significantly in the remaining rounds. 

It's more beneficial to sell the product to John for $150, which guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids any further risk of losing more money in the negotiation with Bob."
