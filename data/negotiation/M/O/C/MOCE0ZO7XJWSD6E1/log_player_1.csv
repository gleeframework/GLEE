Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always best to try for more if possible.
* **Understand Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  We need to offer a price that is attractive to him but still profitable for us.
* **Leave Negotiation Room:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us closer to our guaranteed sale price.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:**  Highlighting that this is an exclusive offer before it goes to someone else can add perceived value for Bob. 

By starting high but still within a reasonable range of Bob's valuation, we increase the chances of:

* **Bob accepting outright:** We get the best possible price.
* **Bob countering:**  This opens up negotiation where we can potentially settle at a price higher than $1,500,000.

Even if Bob rejects our offer, we haven't lost anything, as we have John ready to buy at our desired price."
