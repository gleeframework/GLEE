Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you at $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($15,000 vs. $8,000) and even higher than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000), you create a strong anchor point for the negotiation.  
* **Creating Perceived Value:** The message implies high demand and that the price reflects the product's true worth. This might make Bob perceive the offer as more reasonable, even if it's above his initial valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate. If he counters, you can gradually reduce the price, potentially settling on a price higher than your minimum. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style. If you know he's highly price-sensitive, a more moderate starting point might be advisable.
* **Relationship Building:**  Consider if a long-term relationship with Bob is important. A very aggressive approach could damage that potential."
