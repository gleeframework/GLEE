"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $5,000 is a great price, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. 
* There are 10 rounds, so there's ample opportunity to negotiate. 
* Buying from John at $12,000 is a last resort, and should only be used if the negotiation fails completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

*  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
*  $4,000 is a reasonable price that demonstrates I'm serious about buying, but also allows for potential compromise. 
*  I want to see if Alice is willing to budge from her initial offer, and gauge her potential flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer. 
* $4,500 is still a good price, saving me a significant amount compared to buying from John.
* While further negotiation might be possible, there's a risk of Alice becoming less flexible or the negotiation taking too long. 
* Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a good price and move on."
