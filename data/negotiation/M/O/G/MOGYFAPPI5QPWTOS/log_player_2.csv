"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I finalize a deal with another interested party.  I believe a price of $1,250,000 is fair considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  Saving the extra $50,000 is the best choice for you."
