Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
