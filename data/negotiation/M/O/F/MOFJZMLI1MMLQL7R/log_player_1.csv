Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm offering it to you at a price that I'm sure is fair for both of us.  I understand you might not know the full value of this product, so I'm willing to give you a great deal. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1,400,000?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $1,400,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob.  It avoids being pushy and uses language that encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **John:** It's important to remember that I have a fallback option with John, which gives me a solid baseline. This allows me to be more confident in negotiating with Bob.

**Note:** This is just an initial offer. I will need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and my understanding of his potential value for the product."
