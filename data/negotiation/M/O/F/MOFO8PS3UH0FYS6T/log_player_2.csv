"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still too high for him. It's worth exploring if he can get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit more than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a price closer to his ideal price point.  He's starting with a counteroffer that's $2,000 lower than Alice's initial offer, leaving room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows he's serious about buying but is also willing to push for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can work something out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $11,000 is closer to his target, he can likely push for a better deal by making another counteroffer. He can use the fact that Alice has already lowered her price as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a bit more, but I'm still hoping to get the price a little lower. How about $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's raised his offer from $10,000 to $10,500, showing he's willing to compromise.  This counteroffer is a reasonable step towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a good price for both of us, and it's fair. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking for a lower price.  Alice has already rejected a price at $10,500, and she's sticking to $11,000. Bob can continue to try and negotiate a lower price. There are still 5 rounds left, and he might be able to get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to bridge the gap. He's raised his offer again, showing he's serious about buying.  He's only $250 away from Alice's last offer. This counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay a little more but is still seeking a deal that benefits him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already tried several counteroffers and Alice hasn't budged from $11,000.  At this point, it's better for Bob to accept the offer. 

Here's why:

* **Time is running out:** There are only 3 rounds left.
* **Limited upside:** While Bob could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll get a significantly lower price.
* **Buying from John is expensive:**  If the negotiation fails, Bob will have to pay $15,000 to John, which is significantly more than Alice's offer.

Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that's within Bob's budget and avoids the risk of a higher price with John."
