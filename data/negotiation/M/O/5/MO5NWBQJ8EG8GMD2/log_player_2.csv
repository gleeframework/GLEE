"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $11500. I think it's a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's $10,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend no more than $10,000.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still above Bob's $10,000 limit.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
