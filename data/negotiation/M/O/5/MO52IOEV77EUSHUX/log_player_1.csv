"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $17,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($15,000) and slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob ($10,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing my goal of maximizing profit. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $12,000 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he has shown interest in the product.  I can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This would give us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($12,000) and my initial offer ($17,000).
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the mutual benefits of the deal (""give us both a good deal"") to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While this is a concession, it still leaves me above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired target.
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a better price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Selling to John for $15,000 gives me a solid fallback option, so I can afford to be a bit more patient in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $13,000 is closer, I'm still a bit off on that price.  Let's try $13,500.  It's a small step up from your offer, but it gets us much closer to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate but not giving away too much.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize that the small increase ""gets us much closer to an agreement"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows flexibility and willingness to close the deal."
