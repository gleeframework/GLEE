"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $17,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $12,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This would give us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $13,000 is closer, I'm still a bit off on that price.  Let's try $13,500.  It's a small step up from your offer, but it gets us much closer to an agreement. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
