"Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $7,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about $8,000?  That's my absolute limit, and it's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
