"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts with a strong opening price that's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach sets the stage for a back-and-forth that could potentially lead to a higher price for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $7,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about $8,000?  That's my absolute limit, and it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum threshold.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale and getting the same price from John."
