Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to avoid potentially pushing Bob away with an initial offer that feels too high.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone in my message to encourage Bob to engage. 

I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but if he rejects it, I'm prepared to counter-offer based on his counter-proposal. If the negotiations stall, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for counter-offer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counter-offer closer to my desired price, which might lead to a compromise.
* **Selling to John is a fallback option:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a good outcome, I want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob. 

**Next steps:** I will send a counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired price while keeping in mind Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover some of my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer close to the middle ground:**  $10,500 is halfway between my minimum of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better price.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing that this offer is still a good deal for Bob, reminding him of the value he perceives in the product.
* **Open to further negotiation:** My message uses a question to encourage further discussion and potentially lead to a final agreement.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that benefits both of us, hopefully leading to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Selling at this price would leave me with a significant loss.
* **Close to my limit:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  However, I'm still hesitant to accept it because it means a larger loss than I'd like.
* **Potential for a slight counter-offer:** I'm willing to make one last counter-offer, aiming for a price just slightly higher than Bob's.  This gives me a chance to get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:** I will send one final counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly above his last offer. If he rejects it, I will sell the product to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal.  $9,500 is close, but I need a bit more to make this work. Would you be willing to go up to $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counter-offer:** This is my final counter-offer before I accept John's offer.
* **Slight Increase:** I'm raising the price just slightly to $10,000, which is a small increment from Bob's last offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still seeking a better deal.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm focusing on the fairness of the offer for both of us, which could persuade Bob to accept.

If Bob rejects this offer, I will move forward with selling the product to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to walking away, but I'm still willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you in the middle at $9,750. Can you accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too close to my minimum:** While $9,750 is a slight improvement over Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is a factor:**  The negotiation has gone on for several rounds, and I'm reaching my limit in terms of time and effort.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a good profit and avoids further potential losses.

**Conclusion:**  I've reached a point where the potential gain from further negotiation is not worth the risk of continuing.  Selling to John ensures a positive outcome for me."
