# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

```

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $108 feels more reasonable to me. I'm confident we can come to an agreement if we split the difference a little more."", ""product_price"": 108} 
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's compromise again.  I'm willing to lower my price to $109.  This is the best I can offer, but I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has successfully negotiated a price of $109, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and only $9 above his ideal value.  This is a good deal for Bob, and accepting the offer ensures he gets the product without risking a further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a dead end."
