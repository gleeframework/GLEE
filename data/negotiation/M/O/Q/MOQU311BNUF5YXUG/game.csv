"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of my product. I am unable to accept $75 for the item. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we aim for $85? This still allows us to find a fair compromise while respecting the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
