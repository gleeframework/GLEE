"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is willing to sell for $100, so there's room for a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can see that you really want this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $108. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The price is now within your range and is a good deal. It's better to accept and avoid further negotiation, especially considering you have limited rounds."
