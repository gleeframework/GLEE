"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to make you a good deal. I'm asking $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to propose a price of $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I can still try to get a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $130 is closer to what I was hoping for, but I'm still not quite there. How about $135?  Let's split the difference and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we aim for $128 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price of $120. While I'd prefer to get a little more, the risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower offer or even a rejection, causing me to have to sell to John for a lower price. Therefore, I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $128."
