Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal, as he values the product at $100, and it allows me to get close to the value I'd like for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a slightly better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a fair price that is still within Bob's value range, but closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $82 is getting very close to my minimum, but I'm not confident I can push him any higher.  Since John is willing to pay $80, I'm going to sell to him and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
