(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John at $8,000, as I believe I can get more from Bob."
