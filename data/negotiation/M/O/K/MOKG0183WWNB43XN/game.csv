"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is quite high for me. I would be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, the product's inherent worth and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This revised offer reflects the true value of the product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can go up to $700,000.  This is a fair offer considering my constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. However, the $700,000 offer is still significantly below my minimum.  To be frank, anything under $1,100,000 would be difficult to justify. Let me know if that price range is at all feasible for you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
