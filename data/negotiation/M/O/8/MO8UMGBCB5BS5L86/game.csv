"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I believe $900000 is too low for the value this product holds for me. I'm willing to offer you $1000000 for it, a price that still leaves a substantial profit for you and allows me to acquire the product at a reasonable cost.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also allowing me to earn a reasonable profit.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my offer. However, $950000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle at $975000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",980000.0,Alice,5,
