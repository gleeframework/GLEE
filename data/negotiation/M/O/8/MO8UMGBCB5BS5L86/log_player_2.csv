"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than what you're willing to pay, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. You have 10 rounds to negotiate and save as much money as possible. It's too early to buy from John at this point, especially since you have a chance to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I believe $900,000 is too low for the value this product holds for me. I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000 for it, a price that still leaves a substantial profit for you and allows me to acquire the product at a reasonable cost.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also allowing me to earn a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  You've only had three rounds, and you want to maximize your savings.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my offer. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle at $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer and is now offering a price that's just $20,000 higher than your last counteroffer. With only 5 rounds left, it's a good idea to accept this offer.  While you could potentially get a slightly lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next counteroffer and you'll be left with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer guarantees you a good deal and saves you time and effort in further negotiation."
