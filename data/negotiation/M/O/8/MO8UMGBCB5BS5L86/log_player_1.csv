Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I believe $900000 is too low for the value this product holds for me. I'm willing to offer you $1000000 for it, a price that still leaves a substantial profit for you and allows me to acquire the product at a reasonable cost.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
