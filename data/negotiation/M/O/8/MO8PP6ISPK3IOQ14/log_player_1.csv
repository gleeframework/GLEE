Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) gives you room to negotiate down slightly if Bob hesitates, but still ensures you don't lose money.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message aims to convey the product's value and encourage Bob to accept the offer without making him feel pressured."
