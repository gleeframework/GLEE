"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs. Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for your business. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this offer reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 is closer to my budget, it's still not a price I can comfortably accept.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down further to $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,750,000 is closer, I'm still unable to accept that price.  To reach an agreement, I'm offering $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the true value we both place on this product.  Let's work towards a deal that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
