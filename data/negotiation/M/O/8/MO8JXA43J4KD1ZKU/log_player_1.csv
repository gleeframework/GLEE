Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it's important to set a high bar initially. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,500,000 is my ideal price, I'm aware that Bob might not be willing to pay that. This price leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers.
* **Knowing My Floor:** I have a safety net with John's offer of $1,000,000. This gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer. If his offer is close to my desired price, I may accept. If it's significantly lower, I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
