"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $170 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $105 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
