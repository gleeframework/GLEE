"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range. This gives me some room to negotiate, while also showing that I'm confident in the product's worth.  I'm hoping Bob will accept the offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I will reject his offer and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $8,500, which is still above my minimum value but shows flexibility. I'm hoping this will make Bob feel like we're getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $7,500 is closer to my minimum value, I am still not willing to sell for less than $8,000. I will reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make a final concession -  I'll sell it to you for $8,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not going to go any lower.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm offering my minimum price, signaling to Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal.  I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but if not, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $7250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It is more beneficial to sell to John for $8,000 than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting a lower price or running out of time."
