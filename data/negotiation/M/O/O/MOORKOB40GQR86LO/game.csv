"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12500. I can do $13500, which is a bit closer to my original price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13500, so I'll offer $12750. Can you consider that?",12750.0,Bob,4,
