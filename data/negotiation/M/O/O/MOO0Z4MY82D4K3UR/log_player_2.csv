"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. There's room for negotiation since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a good price, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already shown that he's willing to pay more than Alice's bottom line ($8,000), so there's room for a compromise. He can likely get the price down to $8,750 or $8,800 with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a little too high.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for me."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,200. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is a good price for Bob.  It's lower than John's price, and while Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge again.  At this point, accepting the offer seems like the best option to save money and secure the product."
