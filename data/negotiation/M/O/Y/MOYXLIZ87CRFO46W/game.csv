"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend significantly less than $1000000. Would you be willing to consider $500000? This is a fair price given the value I place on the product. ",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $500000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $750000, which still leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“  I'm offering $650000. This feels like a fair price, considering the value I see in this product, and it allows us to close the deal quickly. What do you say?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $650000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $700000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,
