"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about $7,500? That's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while working for my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $8,100. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort you're putting into this negotiation. However, I do have other options, and $8,100 is pushing my budget.  My final offer is $7,700.  If that doesn't work, I'll need to explore my alternatives.",7700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,700 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $8,050. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",8050.0,Alice,7,
