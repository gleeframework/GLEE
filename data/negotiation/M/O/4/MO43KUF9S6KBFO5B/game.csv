"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still gives you a fantastic deal considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still interested in making a deal with you, but $8,750 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,875?  This would be a great compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  What do you think?",8875.0,Alice,5,
