Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it would be valuable to you, so I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but still make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $8,000, so offering it slightly below his valuation won't work.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The fact that John will buy the product for $10,000 gives us leverage. 
* **The Sweet Spot:** Offering the product at $9,500 creates a significant profit margin for us while still potentially enticing Bob to accept. He gets a $500 discount compared to his perceived value. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and closing the deal with Bob."
