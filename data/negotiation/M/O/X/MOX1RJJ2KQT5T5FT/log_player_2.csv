"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John.  There's room to haggle between $140 and our $150 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit steep for me, though. Would you consider $125?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. Starting with a lower offer than our actual maximum allows for this. 
* **Polite & Reasonable:** We maintain a polite tone to foster good negotiation. We don't want to lowball offensively, as that could make Alice less willing to deal.  $125 is a significant price drop, but it's still potentially profitable for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $132? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $132 is a solid price, saving us $18 compared to John's offer. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise by moving closer to our price. This suggests it might be difficult to negotiate a significantly better deal.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice backing out or us running out of time/options. Accepting now secures a good price."
