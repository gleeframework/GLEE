"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is starting at $1,150,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows for counter-offers.**  By rejecting, you can try to get a better price without losing the opportunity entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your value and my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **Fair offer:** $1,050,000 is still above Alice's value of $1,000,000, making it a potential win-win. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This counteroffer provides space for Alice to counter back without feeling like she's giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to show my commitment to a deal, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** Even though Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your ideal price point.
* **Further negotiation is possible:** There's still room for compromise. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting this offer would save you money compared to John, but there's a chance you might get a better deal if you keep negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000.  It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant move:**  This counteroffer is a modest increase from your previous offer, signaling that you are serious about closing the deal while still keeping the pressure on Alice.
* **Towards a middle ground:** This offer is halfway between your previous offer and Alice's current offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Finality:**  Mentioning ""Let's make this deal happen"" adds a sense of urgency, hinting that you might walk away if she doesn't come closer to your price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,087,500? This is a fair price for both of us and I think it's a good compromise.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:**  Alice's offer is only $87,500 above your ideal price point of $1,000,000.
* **Reasonable compromise:** Alice is showing a willingness to meet you halfway. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you reject, you risk Alice becoming less flexible, or even walking away from the deal.  John's price is significantly higher, making this offer a good option."
