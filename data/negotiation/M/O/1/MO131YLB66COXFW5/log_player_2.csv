``` 

It's not worth it to accept Alice's offer at $1,200,000 because it exceeds your budget. You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

This is your maximum budget. Let's see if Alice is willing to come down to that price."

Alice's offer is still above my budget. I'll reject and see if I can get her lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is a compromise between my budget and Alice's previous offer. Hopefully, she sees the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to keep pushing for a lower price, Alice's offer of $950,000 is very close to my budget.  It's worth it to accept and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might result in her walking away or me having to go with John."
