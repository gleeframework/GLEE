"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  $900,000 is still too high, and Bob has plenty of room to negotiate a better price.  He should aim for a price closer to Alice's value of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $850,000, which is halfway between his maximum value of $1,200,000 and Alice's minimum value of $800,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation and shows that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high for Bob.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay at this point. He should continue to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows that he is still serious about buying the product but is also trying to find a price point where both parties can agree. He is still significantly below Alice's offer, but the offer is getting closer to a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still too high, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiations. Bob is clearly trying to get the product at a lower price, and continuing to negotiate is the best option. While he can always buy from John, the current negotiation is getting him closer to a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now increasing his offer significantly, demonstrating that he's willing to compromise.  He's still below Alice's offer, but this shows that he's willing to meet halfway to try and reach a deal before the round limit is reached.  This is a strategic move to hopefully force Alice to accept and close the deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, he can still try to negotiate further. There are only a few rounds left, and buying from John is a viable option, but Bob can still try to get a slightly better deal. He can offer a price closer to $950,000 in the next round, which is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a strategic counteroffer. It shows that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise.  By offering $950,000, he's splitting the difference between his last offer and Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to reach an agreement. With only a few rounds left, it's a move to try and secure a deal before resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a difficult decision, but it's the best option for Bob given the circumstances.  

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $1,000,000 is getting very close to Bob's maximum value, and he has no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower offer in the final round.
* **Time is running out:** This is the 9th round, meaning there's only one negotiation left.  If he rejects and Alice rejects his counteroffer, he's left with no choice but to buy from John.
* **John's offer is still a backup:** While John's offer is higher, it's a guaranteed deal. 

By buying from John, Bob secures the product, minimizing the risk of a failed negotiation with Alice.  Even though he pays more, he gets the product and avoids the potential of getting nothing at all."
