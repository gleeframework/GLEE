Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $750000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?

While $750,000 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows for another counteroffer to potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $725000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and rarity. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm proposing a new price of $725000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal. What do you think?

Alice has come down to a price that's within your budget and not too far from your last counteroffer. It's likely that further negotiation will not result in a significantly better price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price within your budget."
