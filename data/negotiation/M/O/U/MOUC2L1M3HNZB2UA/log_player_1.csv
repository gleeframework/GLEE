"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120.  It's a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that this is a ""great deal"" for both of us, which might make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum price but still above it.  There's potential to get a higher price if I continue negotiating. 
* **Multiple Rounds:** I have 10 rounds in total, so I can afford to reject this offer and try to get a better price.  
* **Avoiding John:** While $80 is guaranteed, selling to John is a last resort. I want to maximize my profit if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm  rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to keep the negotiation moving.
* **Middle Ground:** I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness:** I'm again emphasizing ""fairness"" to encourage Bob to consider my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. How about $105? That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my desired price range. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We're nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Potential Loss:** While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk Bob will walk away, and I'll be stuck with the $80 offer from John.

Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit, and it's better than risking a potential loss by continuing to negotiate."
