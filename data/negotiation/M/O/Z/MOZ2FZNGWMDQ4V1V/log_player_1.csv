Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I'm looking for a product within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  $8,500 is too far below my minimum value, and I still have time to negotiate. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not desperate to sell yet.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise.  If not, I'm willing to sell to John for $10,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Okay, Bob's offer of $8,800 is getting closer to my minimum value.  While I'd love to get closer to $9,000, I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him."
