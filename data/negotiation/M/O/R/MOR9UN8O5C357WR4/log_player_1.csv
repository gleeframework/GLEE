Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is well above my budget. I'm  very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This reflects the maximum value I'm able to pay.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, $1,300,000 remains outside my budget.  I'm very eager to acquire this product, but I'm unable to go beyond my initial offer of $800,000.  This represents my absolute maximum, and I'm hopeful we can find a way to bridge the gap.

Explanation:

Bob has made it abundantly clear he won't budge from his $800,000 offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better deal. Accepting his offer would be a substantial loss compared to John's standing offer.  Therefore, the best decision at this point is to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
