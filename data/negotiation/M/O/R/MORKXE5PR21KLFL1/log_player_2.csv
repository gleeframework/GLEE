"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better.  He should reject the offer and see if he can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better one elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate further. There are still many rounds left, and Bob may be able to convince Alice to come down to a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this deal would be beneficial for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11750. It's a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still not ideal. Bob can likely get a better deal if he continues negotiating. With several rounds remaining, there's still room for negotiation and potentially a lower price.  It's risky to buy from John at this point, as Bob might be able to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $11,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,250. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11250. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12000. It's the price I'm willing to sell the product for, and I believe it's still a fair deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is equal to John's price. At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a lower price. Bob has already made several counteroffers and Alice's price is not moving down. Therefore, it's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John at $12,000. This avoids further negotiation and ensures Bob gets the product at a known price."
