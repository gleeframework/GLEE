# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate further. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $725,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject the counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  $725,000 is a good deal and saves him $75,000 compared to John."
