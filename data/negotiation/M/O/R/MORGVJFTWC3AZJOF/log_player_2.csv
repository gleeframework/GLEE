Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $108. What do you think?

The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it to you for $108. That's a good deal for you, as you're willing to pay up to $120.  You'd save $12 by accepting her offer."
