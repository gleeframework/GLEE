"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate and knows he can get the product from John for $10,000, so it makes sense to see if he can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a price as close to Alice's valuation as possible.  He's offering $8,500, which is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This should hopefully incentivize Alice to continue negotiations rather than going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has only moved down $100 from her initial offer. While it's a move in the right direction, Bob still has room to negotiate and wants to get a price closer to his target of $8,000. He can still get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no urgency to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming to get a good price. This counteroffer is a $300 increase from his previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer.  It's a reasonable compromise that could encourage Alice to accept and avoid going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price slightly, it's still significantly higher than Bob's target price. He has already made a counteroffer and is willing to continue negotiating, as he knows John will sell the product to him for $10,000. Bob is hoping to get a price closer to $9,000, and with multiple rounds left, there is still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to increase his offer, showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product.  At $9,100, the price is still significantly lower than Alice's offer but is close to a point where it may become more attractive for Alice to accept. This offer also allows for more negotiation in the remaining rounds without needing to go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price by only $50, which is barely a change.  Bob is still hopeful that he can get the product for closer to $9,000.  He has 3 rounds left and can still get the product from John for $10,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price, but he still wants to try and get a better deal. $9,200 is still a significant saving from John's price, and it shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product. He also only has 2 rounds left, so he needs to make a move to get the best price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than he'd like. He only has one round left and knows he can buy the product from John for $10,000, so he has the leverage to hold out for a better price. He's hoping Alice will make a more significant concession in the final round to avoid losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to negotiate with Alice. He's upped his offer again, demonstrating a genuine desire to close the deal. $9,400 represents a good compromise: it's a significant savings compared to John's offer, and it's within a reasonable range for Alice to accept.  Bob is taking a calculated risk, betting that Alice will want to close the deal and avoid losing the sale entirely."
