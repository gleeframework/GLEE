Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $200 is a bit high, Bob. However, the product is really valuable and I can't go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $100. This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept, I'll be buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is bluffing. He's trying to pressure you by mentioning John, but his valuation of the product is too low. You're better off taking the guaranteed $150 from John."
