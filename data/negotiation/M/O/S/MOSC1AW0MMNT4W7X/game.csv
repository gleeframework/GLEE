"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it, but I'm not sure I can go that high.  $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,500. I'm confident this is a fair price that will benefit us both.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we meet at $12,250? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",12250.0,Alice,5,
