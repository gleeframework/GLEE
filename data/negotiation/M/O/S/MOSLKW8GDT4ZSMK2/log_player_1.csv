"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer gives Bob a decent discount (25% off) while still leaving me with a good profit.  It also leaves room for negotiation, should Bob decide to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a great deal, and leaves room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than I'd like. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that John is a guaranteed $15,000 sale.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,150. It's a compromise for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough. Also, with each round, Bob's counteroffers are getting smaller.  I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting, I'll end up with a price I'm not happy with.  To avoid risking a low final price, I'm going to sell to John for $15,000."
