"Alice, your initial offer is quite high.  While I recognize the value of this product, I'm only willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and allows for a comfortable profit for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, I know the true potential of this product and  $1,050,000 significantly undervalues it.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still providing you with a significant return on your investment.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000.  This price reflects the potential of the product while still providing you with a substantial profit. Let's make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
