"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll love it! My price is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly approach can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  Hinting at the product's value for Bob can make him more willing to consider a higher price.

**Note:**  I'm setting a price that's still potentially acceptable to Bob, considering his value of $80, but also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $80.  Would you be willing to come down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this offer would be a major loss. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest in the product.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if we can reach a compromise.
* **Selling to John:**  While I can sell to John for $150, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price through negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum but still lower than my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. $90 is a little low for me, but I'm open to coming down to $125. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Maintaining Value:** $125 is still above my minimum of $150, ensuring I don't lose out on too much profit.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""working with you"" to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Direct Question:** I'm ending with a direct question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer to my starting point, it's still not a good deal for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob is demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John would be a guaranteed $150, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $105 but still above my minimum, keeping the negotiation moving towards a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $125 and Bob's current offer of $105. This shows a commitment to finding a solution.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Confidence in the Product:**  Reiterating my confidence in the product can subtly nudge Bob towards accepting a slightly higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I'm hoping Bob will find this offer appealing and accept it. However, I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary, always keeping my minimum price of $150 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, his offers are consistently too low.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I'm not ready to give up on negotiation yet. Bob is showing interest in the product, and I believe there's a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John would be a guaranteed $150, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $100, but still above my minimum, aiming to close the deal while maximizing my profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go down to $110. That's a fair price considering the quality of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's only $10 more than Bob's last offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Call to Action:**  I'm using strong language like ""Let's close this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

I'm hoping Bob will find this offer appealing and accept it. If not, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work. Let's meet in the middle at $105. I'm confident you'll be happy with the price, and I'm eager to get the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're in round 8, leaving only two rounds left. I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price, but Bob's offers are still consistently below it. 
* **High Risk of Lower Price:**  If I keep negotiating, there's a strong possibility that I'll end up with a final price lower than my minimum.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a $150 profit, which is above my minimum. 

**Conclusion:**

It's better to accept the guaranteed profit from John than to risk a lower price with Bob, especially with limited time remaining."
