"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the features and benefits you've described, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to an agreement at this price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
