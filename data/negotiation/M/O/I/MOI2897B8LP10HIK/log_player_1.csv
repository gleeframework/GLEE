Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,450,000 is higher than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $1,450,000 is lower than Bob's maximum of $1,500,000. This gives him room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It leaves room for compromise:** You can still negotiate further if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

By starting at $1,450,000, you are showing that you are serious about getting a good price, but you are also willing to be flexible to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, it's still far lower than the $1,450,000 you initially offered. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting Bob's offer keeps the possibility of a better deal open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows you're willing to compromise but not settle for a drastically lower price.
* **Lower than your initial offer:**  This indicates you're open to negotiation and willing to meet halfway. 
* **Still above your minimum:** You're still aiming for a price that's more favorable to you than selling to John. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time, Bob's offer is closer to your desired price and is significantly higher than selling to John.  It's time to accept and secure the deal."
