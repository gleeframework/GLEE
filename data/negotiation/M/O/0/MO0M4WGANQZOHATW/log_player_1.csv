Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it gives you a significant profit (a gain of $200,000 over your minimum) while still leaving room for potential negotiation with Bob.  

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **Higher Than John's Offer:** $1,000,000 is more than what John is willing to pay, so you're still guaranteeing yourself a profit.
* **Lower Than Bob's Value:**  $1,000,000 is less than the product's worth to Bob, giving him a potential gain of $200,000. This creates an incentive for him to accept. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This offer allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. You might be able to settle somewhere between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. 

Let me know if you want to explore other strategies or adjust the offer based on Bob's response!"
