"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $750,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $600,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product to me and your original asking price. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $650,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our positions and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",650000.0,Bob,6,
