Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John provides a safety net at $800,000, aiming high with Bob is crucial to maximizing profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's room for negotiation above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a win-win scenario. Bob gets a $200,000 discount from his valuation, and we secure a significant profit margin above our minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, justifying the high price. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is an initial offer. There's always the possibility of negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, we can still adjust our price downwards, staying above our $800,000 guarantee from John."
