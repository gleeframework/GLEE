"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I'm sensing your seriousness about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However,  $950,000 remains below my bottom line. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This offer reflects the product's value while recognizing your interest.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
