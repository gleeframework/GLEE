"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is a move in the right direction, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $1,900,000? It's a smaller concession, but I believe it's fair considering the benefits this product offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I still think $1,900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,700,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I respect that.  However, I need to be realistic about the value this product represents. How about we settle at $1,825,000?  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise from both sides.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but I need to be honest with you, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Bob,6,
