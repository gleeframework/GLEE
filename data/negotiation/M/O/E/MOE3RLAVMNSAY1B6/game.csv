"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in this product, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $14000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $16000 and $18000. How about $16500? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great deal for you too.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $16500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to offer $15500.  This is a good price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
