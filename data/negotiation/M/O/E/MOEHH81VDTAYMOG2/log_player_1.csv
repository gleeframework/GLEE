Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $11,500. I believe it will be very valuable for you, but I need to sell it quickly. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but knows Bob won't pay that.
* **Time Value:** Selling to John guarantees $12,000, so offering a slightly lower price to Bob speeds up the sale and might be worth the small loss.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially meeting in the middle. 
 
**The offer aims to create urgency and suggests a discount, while still aiming for a significant profit.**"
