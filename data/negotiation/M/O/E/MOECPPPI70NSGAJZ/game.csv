"Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000? I believe this might be closer to what we can agree on.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This is my final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $1,350,000 is too high for me. Could you possibly lower the price to $1,300,000? I believe this might be a more reasonable compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
