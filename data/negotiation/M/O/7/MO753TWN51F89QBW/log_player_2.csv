``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially with such a large difference between Alice's offer and the price from John.  You can potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to see how flexible Alice is. This shows you're serious about getting a good deal and encourages further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still a significant difference from your ideal price. You're still better off negotiating further to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith and demonstrate that I'm willing to compromise. This puts you closer to Alice's price while still keeping room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering a price that is significantly lower than John's, and only one round away from you reaching your goal. It is likely Alice is willing to move a little further, however the risk of losing the opportunity to buy at a good price is not worth the potential for a lower price."
