"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $10,000. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Bob,4,
