"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me, but still below what it's worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraint. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. This still leaves some room for both of us to gain from this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still securing a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $825,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum threshold of $800,000 and it's a fair price considering his budget constraints. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations that could potentially lead to a lower offer or a deal with John at the minimum price."
