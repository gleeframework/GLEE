Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the benefits of the product for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price allows for some wiggle room if Bob counters. 
* **Strategic Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale to John at $120, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  $90 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. Bob has shown interest, and I can use this to my advantage.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me leverage and allows me to be more patient in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  It's a great deal for a product you'll love. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I reiterate Bob's interest and highlight the product's value, keeping the negotiation positive.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not giving away too much, keeping the price above my minimum acceptable value. I'm still confident in selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to meet me at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob is now offering $92.50, which is only $2.50 away from my minimum acceptable price of $95.  
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Even though I'm accepting his offer, I'm aware that he's still open to negotiation, and we could potentially reach a slightly higher price in future rounds.
* **Time & Effort:** Accepting his offer saves me time and effort in further negotiation. While I could try to get a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that I'll end up selling to John for $120 anyway. 

While $92.50 isn't ideal, it's a good compromise considering the potential for future rounds."
