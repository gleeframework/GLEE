Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with a price of $950,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter. 
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more amenable to a higher price, even if it's slightly above his perceived value.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, there would likely be back and forth discussions."
