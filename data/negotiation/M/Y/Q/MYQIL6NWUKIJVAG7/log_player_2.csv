"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $11,500 to be comfortable. Can we discuss the possibility of $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, which is the lowest I can go. Can we meet in the middle at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting close to his goal of saving as much money as possible. While he'd prefer to pay less, $11,250 is a good compromise. It's still significantly lower than his initial limit of $15,000, and the negotiation process is taking time.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids further negotiation."
