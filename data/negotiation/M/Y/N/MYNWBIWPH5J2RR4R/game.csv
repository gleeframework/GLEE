"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to my budget. Given my valuation and the potential deal, I'd be happy to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable and fair price for us both.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a significant gap from where I see this product's value.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,050,000.  This feels like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the value this brings to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This is a fair price that gets us closer to a deal, and I believe it's a good compromise given our respective positions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, that price point is a bit too low for me to consider.  My final offer is $1,010,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's true worth.",1010000.0,Alice,5,
