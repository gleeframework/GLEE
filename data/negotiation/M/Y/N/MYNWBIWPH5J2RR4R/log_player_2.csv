Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a significant gap from where I see this product's value.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,050,000.  This feels like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the value this brings to both of us.
