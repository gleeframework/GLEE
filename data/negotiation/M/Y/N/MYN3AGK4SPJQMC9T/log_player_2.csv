"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than John's price. I have room to negotiate for a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offer to leave room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** I want to maintain a positive tone and show Alice I'm serious about buying the product, just not at her current price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By starting at $9,000, I'm aiming for a price closer to my ideal outcome while acknowledging that Alice likely won't agree to this immediately.  This opens the door for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my ideal price, but she's still $500 above what John is offering. I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000. There's a chance Alice might come down further, and even if she doesn't budge much, I'm not losing much by trying to negotiate a slightly better deal before accepting her offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm really working with a tight budget.  Could you do $9,750?  That's the most I can offer."",
 ""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Increment:** I'm increasing my offer by $750, a more significant jump than Alice's last concession, to show willingness to compromise but also signal I'm getting close to my limit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating this is ""the most I can offer,"" I'm adding a touch of urgency, hoping to encourage Alice to make a decision.
* **Below John's Price:** This offer is now strategically placed just below John's price, putting pressure on Alice while still leaving me with the fallback option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer of $10,250.  While she might come down another $50 or $100, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees me the best price and avoids further back-and-forth."
