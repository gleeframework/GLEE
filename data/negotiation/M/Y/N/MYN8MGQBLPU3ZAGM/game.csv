"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm aware that its worth is at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident it could even generate more revenue. I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential â€“ $1,250,000. This allows for a comfortable margin for both of us while ensuring a fair deal.  Let me know your thoughts.
