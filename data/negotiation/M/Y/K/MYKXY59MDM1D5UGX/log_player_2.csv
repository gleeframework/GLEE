"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $10,000. There's a chance Alice might lower her price if you reject her initial offer."
