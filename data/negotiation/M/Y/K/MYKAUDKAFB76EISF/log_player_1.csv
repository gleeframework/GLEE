Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a price of $14,000. I believe it presents significant value for this price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we could offer it for $15,000 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price. This lets us potentially earn more than selling to John.
* **High but Negotiable:**  $14,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but the message frames it as a ""limited time"" offer and implies potential negotiation. This creates urgency and leaves room for Bob to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Secured:**  If Bob rejects the offer, we have the security of selling to John for our minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a degree of risk. There's no guarantee Bob will accept, and he might even counter-offer with a price too low for Alice to accept."
