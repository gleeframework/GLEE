"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to you:** The product is worth $15,000 to you.
* **Alice's offer:** Alice is now offering the product for $13,500.
* **Alternative:** You can buy from John for $15,000.

Alice's offer is the best deal you've been presented with so far, and it's still below your maximum value. Accepting saves you $1,500 compared to buying from John."
