Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum value of $80. I'm also trying to be friendly and open to a conversation, hoping to build a positive relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $80, as it's the most profitable option at this point."
