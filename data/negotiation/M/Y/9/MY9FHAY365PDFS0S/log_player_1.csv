Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum:**  You're leaving room for negotiation and giving Bob a reason to accept.
* **It's a fair compromise:** You're aiming for a price that's closer to your ideal than to Bob's, but still within his range of interest.

Remember, this is just the first step. You'll need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's response and the overall negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850000. That would be a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what you initially offered and what the product is worth to you. 

* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation:** By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap. You're not losing anything by rejecting, as you can still potentially get a better price.
* **You still have leverage:** You have the option to sell to John, so you're not desperate to accept any offer. This leverage gives you power in negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to craft a counteroffer to Bob, taking into account his offer and your own goals. Aim for a price that's closer to your desired outcome while still being reasonable for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** You're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but not giving away too much.
* **Lower than your initial offer:** You're showing flexibility and moving closer to Bob's price point.
* **Still above your minimum:** You're ensuring you get a good deal while leaving room for further negotiation.

This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining your leverage.  You're aiming for a price that's fair for both of you and avoids the need to sell to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $875000? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still below your ideal price, it's very close to it and is significantly higher than selling to John. 

* **Accepting minimizes risk:**  There's no guarantee that you'll get a better offer in the next round, and you risk losing Bob completely. 
* **It's a good deal overall:**  $875,000 is a good outcome, considering the value of the product to you and the negotiation process.

**Next Steps:**

Even though you're accepting the offer, you should continue to monitor the market and potential buyers. You never know when a better opportunity might arise. However, for now, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical and profitable decision."
