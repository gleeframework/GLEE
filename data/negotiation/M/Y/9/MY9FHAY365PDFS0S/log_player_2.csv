"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is significantly more than Alice's valuation of $800,000.
* Bob has room to negotiate further, as he can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if he can't get a better price from Alice. 
* By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price of $850,000.
* Bob still has some room to negotiate and can potentially get a better price. 
*  It's a good strategy to keep rejecting offers and making counteroffers until Bob reaches his target price or gets close to it."
