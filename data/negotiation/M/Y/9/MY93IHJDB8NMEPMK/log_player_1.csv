Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Strong Starting Point:** Offering it at $925,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have John as a backup buyer at $800,000, but aiming higher with Bob first makes sense to maximize your potential earnings. 
* **Confident Language:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob while suggesting a price that is open for discussion."
