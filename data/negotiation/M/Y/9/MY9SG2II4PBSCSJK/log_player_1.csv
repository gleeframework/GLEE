``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $8,000 is significantly less than my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'll counter again, but I might be getting closer to accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm really hoping we can reach a deal.  $10,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500.  Let me know if you're able to go that high."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $11000.  This would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite enough.  I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and it doesn't seem like we're going to be able to close the gap. It's time to move on and take the guaranteed offer from John."
