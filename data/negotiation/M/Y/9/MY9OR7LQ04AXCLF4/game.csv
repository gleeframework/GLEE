"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be a great asset to you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $13,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you standing your ground.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $13,000 is really pushing it. Would you consider $14,500? This is my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",14000.0,Bob,6,
