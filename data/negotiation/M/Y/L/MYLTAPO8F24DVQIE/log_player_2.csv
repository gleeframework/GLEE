"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product for $1000000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Alice's offer is still above her minimum of $800,000, so there's a range where you both can benefit.
* **Buying from John is not optimal at this point.**  You haven't fully explored the potential of negotiating with Alice.

**Next Steps:**  You'll want to make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $900,000. This price allows for a fair profit for you and stays within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  My counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fair price:** $900,000 is still above Alice's minimum of $800,000, suggesting a potential deal that benefits both of us.
* **Strategic messaging:** The message emphasizes the fairness of the offer and highlights the potential profit for Alice. This can make Alice more likely to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $900000 is closer, but I'm still looking to get a bit more for this valuable product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950000? This price allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:**  Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, indicating she's willing to negotiate.  There's still potential to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is premature:**  There's still a chance to reach an agreement with Alice, and I'm hesitant to pay John's full asking price.

**Next Steps:**  I will make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round, trying to bridge the gap further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it would be a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  My counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, showing that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Staying within budget:**  $925,000 is still within my budget of $1,200,000, allowing me to potentially save a significant amount.
* **Appealing to compromise:**  The message focuses on the compromise and fairness of the offer, making it more appealing to Alice.

**Next Steps:**  I'm hoping Alice will see the value in this compromise and accept my offer.  If not, I'll continue to negotiate, but I'm getting closer to my limit."
