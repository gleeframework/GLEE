"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This is a great price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $9,000?  This price still reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it's a good compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,500 is still a little lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer of $8,250. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
