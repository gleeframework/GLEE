"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $9,000?  This price still reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it's a good compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
