Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and see if there's a middle ground we can reach.  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum budget of $15,000."
