"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, and $900,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go slightly above the midpoint. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not convinced we're at the optimal price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal.
