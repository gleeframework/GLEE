"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's features and the market demand. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market and the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $8,000. I'm willing to offer $8,250, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's features and market demand.
