"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's features and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,500 is still too high. I'm still confident I can get a better deal, so I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market and the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $8,000. I'm willing to offer $8,250, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's features and market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,250 is getting closer to my desired price point.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice becoming too firm or the negotiation dragging on. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a decent price and avoid the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
