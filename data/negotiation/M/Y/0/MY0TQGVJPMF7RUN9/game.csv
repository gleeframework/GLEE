"I understand that we're close to reaching an agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $18000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering the product to you for $19500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",19500.0,Alice,5,
