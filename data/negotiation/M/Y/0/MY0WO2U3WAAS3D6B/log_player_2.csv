(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down significantly.  $7,000 is a big drop from her original price, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is coming down, but I'm still not happy with the price. I'll make another counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still trying to stay below Alice's last offer. I'm hoping we can find a compromise in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While this is getting closer to my target price, I still think I can get a better deal.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly.  I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to meet me in the middle this time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has been pretty stubborn about the price, but I'm starting to run out of time. $8,200 is still a good deal compared to John, and it's likely I won't get a lower price from Alice.  I'll take it and move on."
