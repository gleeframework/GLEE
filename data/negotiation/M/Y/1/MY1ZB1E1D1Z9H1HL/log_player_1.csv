Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I believe a price of $1,100,000 reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While a higher initial offer is tempting, going too close to $1,200,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a fair deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
