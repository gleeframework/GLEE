# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's simply too far below the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000. This price acknowledges your needs while still ensuring a reasonable return for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.
