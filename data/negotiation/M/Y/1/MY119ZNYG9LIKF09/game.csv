"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice.  However,  $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, and it's the best I can do at this time.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of $925,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $925,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think it's worth my while. I can offer you a price of $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",950000.0,Alice,5,
