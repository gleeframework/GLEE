"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  It's better to reject and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Bob should start by making a bold counteroffer. This price is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still a reasonable starting point given Bob's maximum budget. This sets the stage for negotiation and lets Alice know that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but still wants to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is a good compromise between Bob's maximum budget and Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge. If not, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Bob should make a final counteroffer at his absolute maximum budget. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but won't go any higher. If Alice rejects, Bob can confidently buy from John knowing he got the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking a further negotiation.  Buying from John guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget."
