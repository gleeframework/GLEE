I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit. It's a bold move, but I'm willing to risk it to see how much Bob values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $14,000 is still too low for me, and I think I can get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $16,000.  This is a reasonable compromise and hopefully shows I'm willing to negotiate."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, $15,000 is a good profit and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
