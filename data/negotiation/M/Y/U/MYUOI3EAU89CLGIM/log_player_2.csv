"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,800,000 is above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $1,500,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

Bob starts with a counteroffer of $1,350,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget. This counteroffer signals to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but he's also not afraid to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,600,000 is closer to his budget than her initial offer, it's still above his ideal price. He's still better off trying to negotiate further to see if he can get a lower price. Since he can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, he has a clear benchmark and doesn't need to accept anything above that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

Bob is still trying to negotiate down. He raises his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he's willing to compromise but still wants a good deal. This counteroffer is closer to his ideal price of $1,500,000 and keeps the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting to accept because it's only $50,000 above his target price from John, Bob is still in a strong position. He has shown Alice that he's willing to negotiate, and she's already come down significantly from her initial offer. There's a good chance she'll come down further, especially since he has a competing offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

Bob is going all in on this round. He knows this is likely his last chance to get the product from Alice at his target price before having to go with John. By offering $1,500,000, he's showing that he's willing to pay the price he's set for himself, and he's hoping that Alice will see the value in closing the deal rather than risking losing it entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's $20,000 above his target price from John, it's a good compromise. He's been able to negotiate a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it's likely that if he rejects again, Alice will either stick with her offer or increase it back closer to her initial price.  There's a chance he could negotiate further, but the risk of losing the deal altogether and having to go with John is too high at this point."
