"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me, and I think I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm happy to go up to $10000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? It's a good deal for both of us and we can finalize this quickly."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $10250? This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,250 is a good deal for me considering the value of the product to Bob and the limited time remaining in the negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with another buyer in the future."
