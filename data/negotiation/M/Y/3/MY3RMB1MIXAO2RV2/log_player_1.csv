Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is what it's worth to me.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. If you're not willing to budge, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is signaling that he won't go higher than his valuation of $12,000.  Since you have a guaranteed offer from John at that price, it's time to cut your losses and sell to John.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to result in a better outcome."
