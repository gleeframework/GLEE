"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $9,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still above my budget. I'm happy to pay $8,000 for the product, which is fair for both of us. Let's close the deal!",8000.0,Bob,4,
