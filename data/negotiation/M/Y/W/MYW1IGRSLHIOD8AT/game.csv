"I'm interested in the product, but $100 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your price point, $80 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90, but that's my final offer. ",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $90 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference. How about $87.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $87.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $82.50. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",82.5,Bob,6,
