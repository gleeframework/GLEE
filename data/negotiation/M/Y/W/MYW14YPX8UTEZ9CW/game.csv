"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,450,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $1,375,000? This reflects the value of the product and is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must adhere to my budget. I am now offering $1,325,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
