"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $110, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:** I use positive language to emphasize the value of the product and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  $110 is still above my minimum of $100, leaving space for compromise.

**Strategic considerations:**

* This is my first offer, and I want to gauge Bob's interest. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly.
* However, if Bob doesn't respond or stalls for too long, I'm prepared to move on to John and secure the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can come to a better agreement. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell below $100, so accepting his offer isn't an option.
* **Selling to John is still possible:**  While $95 is close to my minimum, it's still less than the guaranteed $100 from John.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, and see if Bob is willing to meet in the middle.

**Next steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, keeping in mind that I need to be able to accept a price of at least $100 if he rejects my counteroffer. 
* I'll need to be strategic with my counteroffer to maximize my chances of reaching a deal with Bob while keeping my options open for John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, and I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer within my range:**  $105 is still above my minimum of $100, but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Re-emphasize product value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Open-ended question:**  By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm encouraging Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. 

**Strategic considerations:**

*  I'm trying to strike a balance between being firm about my minimum price and being open to negotiation.
*  If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $100.
*  However, I'm hoping to reach a deal with Bob, as that would result in a higher profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $100 for the product. This is the highest I can go, considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product.
* **No further upside:**  There's no reason to reject his offer and risk getting a lower price or having to sell to John. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time and might result in a stalemate.

**Decision:**

It's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and close the deal. It's the best outcome given the current situation and my goal of maximizing profit."
