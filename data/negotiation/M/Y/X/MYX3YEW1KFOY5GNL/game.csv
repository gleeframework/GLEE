"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is quite a bit below my minimum.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $16,500.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $12,000 is low, but $16,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Could you meet me halfway at $14,250?",14250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $14,250 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $15,500. This would be a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
