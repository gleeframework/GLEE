"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $9,500. While it's a good deal compared to John's price, Bob should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  He has room to maneuver since the product is worth less to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm comfortable paying. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential deal, $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a price that's within Bob's budget and still saves him $1,000 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
