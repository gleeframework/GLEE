"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me. I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a fair starting point considering its potential worth to you.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but the price is a little steep for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is considerably lower than what I'm willing to accept. This product has significant potential, and I believe $1,100,000 is a fair reflection of its value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value this product represents, and I am serious about purchasing it.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would $975,000 be agreeable to you?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. I can tell you're serious, so let's find a middle ground. How about $1,050,000? It's a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
