Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, which I believe holds immense value. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it.  It's a fair price considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000:**  This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Message:** I aim to pique Bob's interest by highlighting the product's potential value. I avoid revealing my minimum price to maintain leverage. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is unfortunately at the very top of my budget.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1200000.  This price reflects my understanding of the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, reflecting the significant value this product offers.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lowered price:** I've lowered my price to $1,350,000, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. This amount is still significantly above my minimum and hopefully, more appealing to Bob. 
* **Final offer:** By emphasizing that this is my final offer, I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal. 
* **Fair compromise:** I reiterate that the price is fair, highlighting the product's value and aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
