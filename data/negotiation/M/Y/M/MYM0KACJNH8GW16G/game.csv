"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000.  This still represents a significant saving for you, and it would allow me to move the product without taking a big loss.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
