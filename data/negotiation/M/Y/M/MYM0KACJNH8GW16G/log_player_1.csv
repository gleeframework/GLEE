Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum price. It leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message:** It's friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob, creating a positive tone.

**Reasoning:**

By starting at $12,000, I'm aiming for a good middle ground.  If Bob rejects, I can lower my price in subsequent counteroffers, or move on to John if negotiations stall. This strategy allows for potential profit while also acknowledging Bob's perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **RejectOffer:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a major loss.

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to close the deal, selling for $8,000 would be detrimental.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value. I can also still sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000.  This still represents a significant saving for you, and it would allow me to move the product without taking a big loss.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This price is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **The message:** The message reiterates the value proposition for Bob while also justifying my position. It remains friendly and open to further discussion.

**Reasoning:**

By offering $10,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests. It's likely that Bob will find this offer more appealing than $8,000, but it still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. If Bob rejects again, I can either lower the price slightly or move on to selling to John."
