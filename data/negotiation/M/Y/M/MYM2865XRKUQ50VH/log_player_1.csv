Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still ensuring I get significantly more than my minimum ($1,000,000) and close to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justify the Price:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""value and potential"" helps justify the high price to Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
