"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $9,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, and this price reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than John's $10,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for negotiation since Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, and Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a fair price considering the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest price possible. While $9,000 is better than John's $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's initial counteroffer of $8,500 was rejected, but it shows Alice is willing to come down from her original price. There's a good chance Bob can convince Alice to come down further, potentially even to his desired $8,500."
