"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $10,000?  That would leave us both with a good margin.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still looking for a bit more wiggle room.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd be happy to take the product for $10,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to close the deal right away.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'll offer you the product for $10,800. It's a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to your business. I'm confident you'll see the benefits of this investment.",10800.0,Alice,5,
