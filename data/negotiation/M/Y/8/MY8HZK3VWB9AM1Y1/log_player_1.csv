"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a good starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to accept $80, but I'm not going to sell it for less.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85. It's a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still giving me a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that low. I'll counter offer again, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm lowering my price to $82.  This is a good compromise, as it's only $2 less than my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, we are already in round 6.  This means I only have 4 rounds left to close the deal.  If I keep rejecting his offers, I risk running out of time and being stuck with a lower price than I want.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so that's the best decision."
