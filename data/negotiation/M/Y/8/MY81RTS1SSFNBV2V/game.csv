"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair starting point considering the immense value it holds.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $1,050,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $1,100,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. While I'm still open to finding an agreement with you, I need to be realistic.  To move forward, I need to see a significant jump in your offer.  Would you be willing to consider $1,090,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
