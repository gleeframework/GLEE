"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair starting point considering the immense value it holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's perceived value.  There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $1,050,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still some room for negotiation.  Bob should continue to try and push for a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $1,100,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. While I'm still open to finding an agreement with you, I need to be realistic.  To move forward, I need to see a significant jump in your offer.  Would you be willing to consider $1,090,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has lowered her price significantly, and it's now only $40,000 above Bob's last counteroffer. 
* **Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could result in Alice walking away, and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Value:** While Bob could try to get a lower price, the current offer is still within his budget and represents a good deal.  

At this point, the risk of continued negotiation outweighs the potential benefit of saving a small amount."
