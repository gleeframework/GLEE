"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair starting point considering the immense value it holds."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, subtly anchoring Bob's perception at a high level.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""fair starting point"" implies willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in a multi-round negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while remaining flexible enough to secure a deal with Bob before we might need to settle for John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is better than John's offer, but it's still significantly below what we aim to get.  We're only in round 2, so we have room to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're looking for a better deal and are willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $1,050,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Ground:** We want to demonstrate our willingness to negotiate by moving from our initial offer but also maintain a firm stance that we're seeking a price closer to our target.
* **Justification:** By saying we're meeting halfway, we anchor the negotiation closer to our desired outcome.
* **Appeal to Mutual Benefit:**  Emphasizing a ""mutually beneficial deal"" reminds Bob that we both want to come to an agreement. 

This counter-offer shows we're serious about negotiating but won't settle for a low price. It keeps us in a strong position for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $1,100,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, we still have room to negotiate. We are aiming for a much higher price, and settling at $1,075,000 this early in the negotiation would leave significant potential profit on the table. 

We need to show Bob we are willing to walk away if he doesn't offer a price closer to our desired range. This rejection keeps the pressure on him to improve his offer significantly in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. While I'm still open to finding an agreement with you, I need to be realistic.  To move forward, I need to see a significant jump in your offer.  Would you be willing to consider $1,090,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Expressing Concern:** We're introducing a slight sense of urgency by acknowledging Bob's hesitation. This suggests time might be running out to make a deal.
* **Demanding a Significant Jump:** We're shifting the negotiation dynamic by asking for a ""significant jump"" instead of just meeting in the middle. This emphasizes that his previous increments were too small.
* **Final Offer Tone (without saying it):**  While not explicitly our ""final offer,"" the phrasing and amount suggest we're reaching the upper limit of what we're willing to accept.  

This strategy aims to pressure Bob to make a serious move. We're still leaving room for negotiation but making it clear that a substantial offer is needed to continue the discussion."
