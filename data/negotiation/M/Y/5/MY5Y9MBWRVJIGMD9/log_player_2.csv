"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly a remarkable item that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $9500 for you to acquire it. I'm confident this offer strikes a balance between fair compensation for me and an affordable price for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $9,500 is more than Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $9,500 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. After considering your offer, I would like to propose a price of $9000 for the product. This allows for a more reasonable compromise while still ensuring a fair return for me. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget and preferences.

Bob should buy from John. Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still above Bob's budget. Since John is willing to sell for $8,000, it makes more sense to go with John and avoid further negotiation."
