Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,100,000. Let me know if you're interested in discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price ($1,100,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob. It positions the price as a ""good deal"" compared to your alternative buyer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate down. This allows you to potentially secure a price higher than $1,200,000. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the guaranteed sale to John."
