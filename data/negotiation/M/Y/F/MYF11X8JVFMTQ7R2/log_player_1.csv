Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point to maximize my profit while still leaving room for a potential deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's initial offer but lower than my original asking price, showing some flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough.  I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees me my minimum desired profit and avoids further negotiation."
