Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to part with it for $14000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm and the value you see in it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $5000 to $7000. I hope we can find common ground.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $6000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique item. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I admire the product, I'm still unable to commit to a price higher than $7000. I'm proposing $6500 as a counteroffer, which I believe is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I look forward to your response.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9000.
