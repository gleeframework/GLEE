"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a fortune, and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its immense value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start the negotiations at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,000,000? This price is fair given the product's immense value, and it allows us to finalize the deal quickly.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
