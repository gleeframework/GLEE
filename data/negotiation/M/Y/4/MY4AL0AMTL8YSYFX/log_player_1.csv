Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it allows for some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is interested in the product at this price, and if not, we can adjust from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise from my original offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product to me, and hopefully, it will be agreeable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $125. While I was hoping to get closer to $150, Bob has been persistent, and this is a fair price given the circumstances. It's also more than what John is offering, making this the most advantageous option for me right now."
