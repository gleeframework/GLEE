"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. I believe its value is quite high, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  You can do better by rejecting her offer."
