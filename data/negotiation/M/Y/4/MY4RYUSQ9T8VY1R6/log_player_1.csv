Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. I believe its value is quite high, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much from Bob as possible, knowing our safety net is John at $12,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than $12,000. 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers motivates Bob to act quickly if he's interested.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
