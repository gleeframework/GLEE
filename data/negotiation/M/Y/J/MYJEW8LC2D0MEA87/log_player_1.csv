{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $9,500 as my starting offer. It's a good balance between maximizing my profit and giving Bob a reasonable discount.  
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone, emphasizing the value to Bob and framing the offer as a win-win situation. 
* **Next Steps:** I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll assess if it's worth lowering my price slightly or moving on to John for the guaranteed $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $7,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable threshold of $8,000.  I'll proceed with a counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is still a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $8,500, which is halfway between Bob's offer of $7,000 and my previous offer of $9,500. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and respectful, acknowledging Bob's constraints while also emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Next Steps:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he rejects again, I'll likely accept John's offer, as it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'll still be open to a slightly higher counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the counter offer Alice. I appreciate you trying to meet me somewhere.  How about we split the difference and say $8,000? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $8,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get more, it's a fair deal considering the back-and-forth negotiation.  Accepting this offer avoids further haggling and ensures a quick sale."
