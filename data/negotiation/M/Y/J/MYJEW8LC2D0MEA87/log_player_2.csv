"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $7,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer (a little over 25% less) creates room for negotiation while still being within the realm of possibility. It signals that I'm serious about buying but not willing to overpay. 
* **Leaves John as backup:** This leaves me with the option to walk away and go with John's $10,000 offer if Alice is completely unwilling to budge.
* **Polite and open to negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and expresses continued interest, encouraging Alice to counter and work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is still a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved a bit, but we're still a significant amount away from a price I'm fully comfortable with. Her offer is closer to her value ($8,000) than mine (maximum $10,000). I'll counteroffer again, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle while still leaving room for some final concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the counter offer Alice. I appreciate you trying to meet me somewhere.  How about we split the difference and say $8,000? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between her current offer ($8,500) and my previous one ($7,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and move towards a deal. 
* **Strategic positioning:** Offering $8,000 is significant because it's her exact value for the product. While she'd ideally like to make a profit, it puts her in a position where accepting is breaking even, not losing money.
* **Simple and clear:**  By framing it as ""splitting the difference"" it keeps the tone positive and straightforward, hopefully encouraging a quick resolution."
