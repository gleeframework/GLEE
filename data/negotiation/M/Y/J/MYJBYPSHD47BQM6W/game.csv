"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is outside my budget.  Given my maximum spending limit, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to move a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet halfway and settle at $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This represents a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement with you, I can't go as low as $900,000.  My final offer is $950,000. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options.",950000.0,Alice,5,
