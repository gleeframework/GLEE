"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for you. My starting price is $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I have 9 rounds left, so I can afford to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the unique value this product offers. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000. It's still a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1050000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below the $1,000,000 threshold.  I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, especially since I have six rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for something in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,075,000. This price recognizes the value you'll gain from the product while also meeting my minimum requirements.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1075000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer $1075000 is too high, I'll go even lower and offer $1050000 was too low, I'll meet you in the middle of that, so I'll offer $1062500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,062,500 is just above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Given that we are in round 6 and I have only four rounds left, it's better to secure this deal now rather than risk losing it by rejecting the offer and potentially having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000."
