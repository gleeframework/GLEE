"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the unique value this product offers. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1100000. It's still a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's find a compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1050000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1050000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for something in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $1075000. This price recognizes the value you'll gain from the product while also meeting my minimum requirements.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1075000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer $1075000 is too high, I'll go even lower and offer $1050000 was too low, I'll meet you in the middle of that, so I'll offer $1062500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
