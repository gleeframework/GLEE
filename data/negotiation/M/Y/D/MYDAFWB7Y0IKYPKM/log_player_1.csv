{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $7,500, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500.  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $8,000 to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
