(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer right away.  You haven't established any negotiation leverage. By rejecting the offer, you can see if Alice is willing to lower her price and how much room for negotiation there is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and sets a clear expectation.  It's important to leave room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but it's still not where I want to be.  I'm going to continue to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to compromise.  This is still a good deal for me, and it's likely to be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While it's still a bit more than my ideal price, it's a good deal considering I'm only five rounds in.  It's possible I could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting further offers or running out of rounds makes accepting this offer the most logical choice."
