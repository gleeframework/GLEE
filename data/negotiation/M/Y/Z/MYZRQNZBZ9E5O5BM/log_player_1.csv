"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm sure you'll love it! I'm looking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation, as you are unsure of Bob's value for the product. It also establishes your willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he can influence the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's below your minimum acceptable price, and there are still rounds left to potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175 to try and work something out.  Let me know if that's a price we can agree on."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $175 is still a bit high for me. How about $150? I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price and you're still in the early rounds of the negotiation. Accepting his offer secures a sale and prevents potential further negotiation rounds that could result in a lower price or even a breakdown in negotiations."
