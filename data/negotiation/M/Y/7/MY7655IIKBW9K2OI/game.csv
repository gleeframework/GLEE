"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both know it holds.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
