"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very valuable for you. I'm asking for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price from Alice. Rejecting her initial offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to her $80 value."
