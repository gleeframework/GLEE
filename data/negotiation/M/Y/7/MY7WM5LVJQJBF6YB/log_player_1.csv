Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $145 leaves some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he tries to negotiate down slightly.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning a ""limited time,"" it subtly implies that if Bob doesn't take the offer, you have other options (John). This creates a bit of urgency.

While I could start higher, there's a chance Bob would reject the offer outright. This price aims for a good balance between profit and the likelihood of Bob accepting."
