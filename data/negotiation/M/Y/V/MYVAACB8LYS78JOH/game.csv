"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know you're also looking for something like this. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
