"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know you're also looking for something like this. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is slightly higher than what you'd pay John, it's still more than your maximum budget. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can buy the product from John for your maximum budget of $1,000,000."
