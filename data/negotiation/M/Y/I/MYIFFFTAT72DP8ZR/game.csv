"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",18000.0,Alice,3,
