Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. Based on my understanding of its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a substantial opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've started with a price of $1,500,000, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's potential value and positions this as an opportunity for Bob. 
* **Confidence:**  I'm expressing confidence in the value, which can subtly increase Bob's perception of its worth.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:** Based on Bob's reaction, I'll decide whether to:
    * **Negotiate:** If he shows interest but wants a lower price, I'll adjust accordingly.
    * **Counter-Offer:** If he makes a counteroffer, I'll consider its value and make a counter-counteroffer.
    * **Sell to John:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low or he shows no interest, I'll sell to John to ensure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 seems a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd like to make an offer of $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm willing to place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 meets my absolute minimum value.  
* **No Upside:** There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in further rounds. 
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing negotiations might take more time and effort, potentially with no better outcome.
* **Certainty:** Accepting Bob's offer provides immediate certainty of the sale and avoids risk. 

It's better to secure the minimum value rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
