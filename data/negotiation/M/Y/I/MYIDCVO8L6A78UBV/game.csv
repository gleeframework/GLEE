"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 just doesn't quite work for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.",10500.0,Alice,3,
