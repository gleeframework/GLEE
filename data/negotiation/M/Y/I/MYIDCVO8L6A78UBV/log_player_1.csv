"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm tempted to take the $9,000, I know the product is worth $10,000 to me, and I think I can get closer to that price with a counteroffer.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 just doesn't quite work for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting my minimum asking price and Bob is getting the product he wants. No need to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with less."
