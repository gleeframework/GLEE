"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but we're willing to start negotiations at $110. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a different price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. He's starting with a counteroffer that's closer to his ideal price of $100 but still offers a bit of room for negotiation.  This counteroffer shows Alice he's serious about a deal but is willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate at $108. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to propose another price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $108, which is only $8 above Bob's ideal price of $100.  It's a good deal considering Bob is willing to pay $120 to John. Accepting this offer means Bob saves $12 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of losing the deal or having to buy at a higher price from John makes accepting this offer the best choice."
