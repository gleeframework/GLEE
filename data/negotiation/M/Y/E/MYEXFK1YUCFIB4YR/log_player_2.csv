"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your desired price range, but significantly lower than John's price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  Considering the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above what I'd like to pay. I'm confident I can still negotiate a better deal. It's worth trying to counteroffer again and potentially reach a price closer to my target."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both understand this product holds. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is within my budget and a good compromise.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers and I would be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price without the risk of a more expensive purchase."
