"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,300,000? This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
