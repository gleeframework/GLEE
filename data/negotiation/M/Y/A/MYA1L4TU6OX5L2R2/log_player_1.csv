Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value but below your minimum.**  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a profit. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer.** This makes it easy for Bob to understand.
* **It includes a positive message.**  This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to respond. 

Remember, the goal is to get as close to your minimum value ($12,000) as possible. Be prepared to counteroffer if Bob doesn't accept this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That still gives you a good price, and it's a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Positive message:**  Encouraging language aims to keep the negotiation positive and motivate Bob to accept. 
* **Value proposition:** I reiterate the benefit for Bob, emphasizing the ""good price"" he can still get.

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground, keeping in mind my minimum value while trying to reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in the hopes of pushing the price closer to $10,000, which would be a better outcome than selling to John. It's important to remember that each round of negotiation brings me closer to my minimum value, so I'm not in a rush to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  That's a fair price that we can both be happy with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a smaller step back from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not give away too much.
* **Positive message:**  I reiterate that this is a ""fair price"" that we can both be happy with, maintaining a positive tone.
* **Closing the gap:**  The offer is closer to Bob's last offer, suggesting that we're nearing an agreement.

By offering $9,500, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that Bob will be willing to accept.  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired outcome, but I'm also recognizing the need to compromise and potentially reach a deal before selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm afraid $9,500 is still too high for me. I really like the product, but I'm not willing to go above $8,000. I'd like to propose a final offer of $8,000. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll make the deal 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is too far below my minimum value of $12,000.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price isn't worth it.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and I'd rather have that guaranteed profit than risk a lower deal with Bob."
