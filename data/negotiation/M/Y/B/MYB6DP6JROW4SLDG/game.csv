"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering you value it at $15,000. Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we settle on $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
