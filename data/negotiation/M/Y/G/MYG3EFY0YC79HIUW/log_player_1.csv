Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After all, I want to get as much money as I can for this valuable product!

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 12,000}

I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $9,500. I'll think carefully about this...

Since the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, I'm not thrilled about selling it for $9,500. However, I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether, and $9,500 is still a decent offer.

For now, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer. Maybe we can meet in the middle or come up with a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to pay $9,500, I'll try to nudge the price up a bit. I'll aim for a price that's still slightly lower than my minimum, but still a bit higher than Bob's offer.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 10,800}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,800, which is $300 more than his original offer. Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Oh no, Bob rejected my counteroffer again! He's now offering $9,000, which is even lower than his original offer. I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, but I still don't want to give up on the sale.

However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm not going to settle for less than that.

For now, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer again and send him another counteroffer. Maybe we can find a price that works for both of us."

For now, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer again and sell the product to John for $10,000. I've had enough of negotiating with Bob, and I'm willing to take the guaranteed sale with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Wait, I made a mistake! I meant to choose option 3 and sell the product to John for $10,000. But since I already chose to make a counteroffer, I'll go ahead and send another one to Bob.
