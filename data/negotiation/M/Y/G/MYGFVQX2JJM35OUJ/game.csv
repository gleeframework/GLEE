,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $150 is a bit lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to come down to $175. This still represents a great value for you, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. ",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  $162.50 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's split the difference and go with $168.75.  That way we both get something we can feel good about.",168.75,Alice,5,
