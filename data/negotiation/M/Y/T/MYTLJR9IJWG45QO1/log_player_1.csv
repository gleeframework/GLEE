"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $125 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my ideal price. I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm countering with $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $130. This is a good compromise,  and it's closer to my ideal price than selling to John.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
