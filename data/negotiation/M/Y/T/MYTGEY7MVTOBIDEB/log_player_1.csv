Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know this is a significant investment, but the value it brings is truly unmatched.  I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value and potential return on investment for Bob.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm inviting Bob to discuss the offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm aware of John's offer and will keep it in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 
* **Bob's Counteroffer:** I'll need to analyze Bob's counteroffer strategically, considering his maximum value and how much I'm willing to compromise.
* **Time Limit:** I have 10 rounds, which gives me a reasonable window to negotiate, but I need to be mindful of the time constraint and not let the negotiation drag on unnecessarily."

* **John's Offer:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $1,000,000, which is a higher price than Bob's offer. However, I want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **Time Pressure:** We are in Round 8, leaving only two rounds remaining. The time pressure is significant.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's now a safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Potential for Compromise:** While there's a chance that Bob might agree to my price in the next round, there's also a risk that the negotiation will fail completely, leaving me with no deal.

**Conclusion:**

To avoid the risk of a failed negotiation and ensure that I receive my minimum desired price, I choose to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I would have preferred to close the deal with Bob at a higher price, the time constraint and the uncertainty of his willingness to compromise make John's offer a more secure and timely solution."
