"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1100000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a revised price of $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both parties, considering the product's worth to you and my initial asking price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $1000000. However, I'm willing to make another concession to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering a revised price of $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
