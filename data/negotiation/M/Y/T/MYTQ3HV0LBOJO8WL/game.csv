"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product. This is my best offer, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,600,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this price point recognizes the value you'll gain while acknowledging the significance of this product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $1,000,000.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
