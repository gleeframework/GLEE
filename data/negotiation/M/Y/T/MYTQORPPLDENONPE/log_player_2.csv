"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential savings you'll gain by making a quick sale.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what Bob is comfortable with.  He can still try to negotiate a lower price, and he has a good chance of getting a better deal than what John is offering.  There are still 7 rounds left to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you're holding firm on your price, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and represents a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $925,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, but $925,000 is still higher than he's comfortable with. It's worth trying to negotiate a slightly lower price before considering John's offer.  There are still 5 rounds left and he has a good chance of getting a deal closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $910,000.  This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 910000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price,  $920,000 is still above what Bob is comfortable paying. There are only 3 rounds remaining, but Bob should hold firm and see if he can get Alice to budge further.  He has a strong chance of getting a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. $920,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $915,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this will be mutually beneficial. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 915000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $915,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the last round before Bob has to decide between Alice's offer and John's offer.  While $918,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, it's only slightly higher than his last offer. There's a good chance that Alice won't come down further, and it's better to accept this offer than risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
