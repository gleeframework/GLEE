"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential savings you'll gain by making a quick sale.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice,  I understand you're holding firm on your price, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and represents a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward.",900000.0,Bob,4,
