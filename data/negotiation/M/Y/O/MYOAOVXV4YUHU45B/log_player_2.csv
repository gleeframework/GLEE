"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $950000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. If you're interested, let me know, and we can discuss the details further. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
