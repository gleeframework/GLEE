"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, which I value at much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. However, $8000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $14000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its true value and the significant discount I'm offering.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $10000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to accept $12000.
