"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, which I value at much higher. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $20000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. However, $8000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $14000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its true value and the significant discount I'm offering.  Let me know your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is my maximum budget.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and it would allow us to reach a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $10000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to accept $12000. This is a fair price considering the substantial discount I'm offering and the value you'll gain from this product. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still outside my budget.  I'm committed to $10000.  This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value you've described. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
