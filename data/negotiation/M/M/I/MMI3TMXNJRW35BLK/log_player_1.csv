"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, which I value at much higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $20000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its true value and the significant discount I'm offering.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is my maximum budget.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and it would allow us to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $10,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to accept $12,000. This is a fair price considering the substantial discount I'm offering and the value you'll gain from this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still outside my budget.  I'm committed to $10000.  This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value you've described. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $15,000. 

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price point, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. John's offer gives me the guaranteed minimum I'm looking for, and with 4 rounds remaining, it's a safer bet than risking further negotiations with Bob."
