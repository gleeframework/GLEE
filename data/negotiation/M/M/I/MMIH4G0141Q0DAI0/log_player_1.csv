"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000.  This is a bold opening, but I believe it's important to set a high bar early on. If Bob is truly interested, he may be willing to negotiate. If he's not, I can always go with John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a higher number in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's latest proposal.  Hopefully, he'll see it as a reasonable middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,850,000 is still a good deal and above my minimum.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely.  I'll accept his offer."
