Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value but still significantly higher than my minimum. This sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price, aiming to establish a positive tone and avoid immediate rejection.
* **Openness:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation process alive. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first move in a potential negotiation. I'll need to be prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and my own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting would mean losing out on potential profit.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to pay a significant amount. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides me with a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob, aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but staying above my minimum.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  Again, I emphasize the fairness of the offer, highlighting the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""Let's make this deal happen"" adds a touch of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Important:** I'm still willing to walk away if Bob doesn't come closer to my price. I'll need to assess his response carefully before making any further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Accepting it would secure a decent profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation.
* **Potential for Stalemate:**  Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a stalemate, forcing me to sell to John at a lower price. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take time and energy, which could be better spent pursuing other opportunities.

**Conclusion:** While I'd ideally like a higher price, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible decision at this point. It balances profit with the risk of further negotiation and the potential loss of a sale altogether."
