"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  To be honest, I have another interested buyer.  I'd be willing to let it go to you for $13,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I know you have another buyer, but $13,000 is still pushing it for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a very competitive offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
