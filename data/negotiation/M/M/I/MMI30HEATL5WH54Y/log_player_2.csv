"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on a high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still too high for Bob, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product but my budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'll offer it to you for $10,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is closer to his budget, he can likely still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He knows he can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's room for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $10,500 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, but she's also sticking to a price point above Bob's comfort zone. It's unlikely that further negotiation will bring her down to $8,000 or lower, especially with only 5 rounds left.
* **John offers a guaranteed price:** John is a reliable alternative with a fixed price of $8,000, which fits perfectly within Bob's budget.

By choosing to buy from John, Bob ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a successful outcome."
