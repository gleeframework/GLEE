"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and even my minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a great deal.
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value, I aim to influence Bob's perception and potentially increase his willingness to pay more. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** While starting high, I want to show Bob I'm open to discussion and finding a mutually agreeable price. This can prevent him from immediately rejecting the offer as unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price given the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have room to negotiate and eight rounds remaining. I'll aim to gently steer the negotiation closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product's unique features and benefits warrant a price closer to my initial proposal. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Compromise:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and showing flexibility by decreasing my price. 
* **Reiterate Value:** I emphasize the product's unique aspects to justify the higher price and potentially shift Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Strategic Concession:**  My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price but still leaves room for further negotiation while staying above my minimum.  I want to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation rounds won't result in a significantly better outcome. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
