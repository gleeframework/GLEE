Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I believe I can still do better. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm starting to run out of time.  I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob, and John is offering me my desired price.  I'm going to sell to John."
