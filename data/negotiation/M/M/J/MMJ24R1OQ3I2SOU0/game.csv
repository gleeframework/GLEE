"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about $1,125,000? That's a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to meet you halfway here. While I value your interest, $1,125,000 is pushing it too low.  Could we agree on $1,250,000? This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
