Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to meet you halfway here. While I value your interest, $1,125,000 is pushing it too low.  Could we agree on $1,250,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's still above your maximum budget and John's offer. It's unlikely she'll go lower, and you're better off securing the product from John at the price you know is acceptable."
