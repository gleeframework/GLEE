Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum value:**  $1,200,000 is more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so there is room for you to negotiate a higher price.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** Starting high shows confidence in your product and gives you room to compromise later.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start lower, around $1,100,000.
* **The market:** If there is high demand for the product, you might be able to push for a higher price.
* **Time constraints:** If you need to sell quickly, you might be willing to accept a lower offer. 

Remember, you can always counter Bob's offers, and you have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for you.  

It's important to hold firm on your minimum value and use this opportunity to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $1,000,000 is still above Bob's offer but closer to your minimum acceptable price.
* **Offer a clear reason:** The message explains why you can't accept Bob's offer but still are open to compromise.
* **Be firm but friendly:** The message maintains a positive tone and focuses on finding a solution that benefits both parties. 

This counteroffer is a good way to test Bob's willingness to compromise and hopefully reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the price could go even lower or that the negotiation could drag on. 

Considering that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, accepting Bob's offer guarantees you a sale that's only slightly below your minimum but also ensures a quicker transaction.  It's a good compromise that minimizes risk and maximizes your profit."
