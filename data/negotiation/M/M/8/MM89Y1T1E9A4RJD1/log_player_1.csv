Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $125 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($100) but below what I know the product is worth to Bob ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $125 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for More:**  While $110 is above my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my target of $125. 
* **Counteroffer Strength:**  Bob's offer is close enough to my initial price that a counteroffer feels reasonable.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm willing to risk a bit more to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. How about we split the difference? I'd be willing to let it go for $117.50.  That way, we both get a fair deal. "", ""product_price"": 117.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one.
* **Fair Deal:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair deal"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Specific Price:**  I'm giving Bob a concrete price to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $117.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'd really appreciate it if you'd consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $115 is very close to my initial target of $125.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try for a few dollars more, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for $100 is too high. 
* **Positive Outcome:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a profitable sale and avoids any further negotiation."
