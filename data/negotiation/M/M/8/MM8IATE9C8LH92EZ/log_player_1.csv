{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a deal that's profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $88. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's the best I can do. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $88 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob.  He's clearly unwilling to budge much, and I'm confident I can get my minimum price from John.  I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
