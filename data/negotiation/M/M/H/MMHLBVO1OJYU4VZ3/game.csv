"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $8,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $8,600 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering my budget and your need to sell.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,600 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,700. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,600 and $8,750, so I'm offering it to you for $8,725. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",8725.0,Alice,5,
