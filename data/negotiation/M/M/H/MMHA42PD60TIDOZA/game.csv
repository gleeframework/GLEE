As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $800,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
