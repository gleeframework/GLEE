""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000,  which is a fair compromise. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good price. Let's keep talking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to a price I can afford. How about $7,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and would allow me to get the product I need at a price that works for me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. While I appreciate the increase, $7,000 is still quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000, and at this point, buying from John is the best option to ensure you get the product at the best possible price for you."
