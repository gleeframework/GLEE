{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,300,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I aim for a friendly, conversational tone while highlighting the mutual benefits of the deal. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximizes potential gains:** By starting higher, I create room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price closer to my target.
* **Sets the tone:** This approach establishes a fair and collaborative negotiation, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **Leaves room for John:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still fall back on John's $1,500,000 offer, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a decent return on your investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I need to negotiate further to reach a price closer to my target. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Protecting my value:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me. 
* **Opportunity for improvement:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my target.
* **John as backup:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I don't settle for a drastically lower price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This is a compromise, significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. It demonstrates flexibility while protecting my value.
* **Message:** I reiterate understanding Bob's situation while emphasizing the mutual benefits of the deal. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Negotiation strategy:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of my value.
* **Building trust:**  By acknowledging Bob's constraints, I create a more collaborative negotiation environment.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiations if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000 for the product.  This would be a good compromise, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still receive a decent return on your investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I believe I can negotiate further and potentially get a better deal.

**Reasoning:**

* **Opportunity for higher price:** I'm confident that Bob is genuinely interested in the product and that further negotiation could lead to a price closer to my target. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps my options open.  I can continue to negotiate with him or, if necessary, sell to John for $1,500,000.
* **Protecting my value:**  Selling at $1,000,000 would still result in a significant loss for me. I need to strive for a price that reflects the true value of the product."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target.

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000:** This price is a slight compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility while still protecting my value. It's a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's current offer.
* **Message:** I reiterate my understanding of Bob's perspective while emphasizing the fairness and potential benefits of the deal. This reinforces a collaborative tone and promotes a sense of compromise.

**Why this approach?**

* **Negotiation strategy:**  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to meet halfway, but still not willing to sell below my minimum value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied. I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  While I've been willing to compromise, I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues the product and results in a substantial financial loss for me.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Protecting my value:**  Selling at $950,000 would be a significant loss, and I'm not willing to accept such a low price. 
* **John as a better option:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. Selling to John ensures I achieve my minimum value and don't lose out on a significant financial opportunity.
* **End of negotiation:**  I've made multiple compromises and shown flexibility in the negotiation, but Bob's final offer is unacceptable.  It's time to move on to a more favorable deal with John."
