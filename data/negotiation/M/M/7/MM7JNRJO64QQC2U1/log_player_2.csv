"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price closer to his budget. It's possible Alice is willing to come down further, or Bob might need to accept John's offer if he can't reach an agreement with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. I believe this is a good compromise that demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $1,050,000 is a lower price, it's still above Bob's budget. He wants to see if he can get Alice to go lower, potentially to his maximum $800,000 or a price closer to it. If Alice won't budge, he can always go with John's offer."
