"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a good deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a decent return on your investment.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000 for the product.  This would be a good compromise, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still receive a decent return on your investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. I believe this is a good compromise that demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied. I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement on this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
