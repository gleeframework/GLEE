"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm starting the bidding at $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for something of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer that's slightly above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation while still staying within a range that yields a significant profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" subtly emphasizes the product's worth, justifying the high starting price. 
* **Politeness:** A positive and professional tone helps set the stage for a potentially fruitful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Given its current market value, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting as it's above our minimum, we still have room to negotiate.  We're early in the process, and accepting now would leave potential profit on the table.  We'll counter in Round 3 to try and meet closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This reflects the true worth of the product."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties.  It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a strong profit margin.
* **Reaffirming Value:**  Subtly reiterating the product's worth reminds Bob of its desirability without being overly aggressive.
* **Seeking Agreement:** The tone remains collaborative, aiming to find a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  This price would allow us both to close the deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a significant profit over our minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob in further rounds, there's also the risk he lowers his offer or walks away. Accepting now secures a very good deal.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation delays receiving payment. Accepting now allows us to reinvest or utilize the profit sooner."
