Round 3
Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $700,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, so I'll offer you a price of $950,000. This is my best offer for now, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original price and doesn't seem likely to budge much. It's not worth the risk of going further in the negotiation and potentially missing out on John's guaranteed offer of $800,000."
