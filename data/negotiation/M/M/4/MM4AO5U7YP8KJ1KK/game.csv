"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",825000.0,Bob,4,
