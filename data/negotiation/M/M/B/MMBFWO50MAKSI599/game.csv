"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $900000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $900000 is just not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $1200000 for this product.  I'm confident it's a great investment for you, and I'm ready to work with you to make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $1200000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're serious about making a deal, I'm ready to finalize it now.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
