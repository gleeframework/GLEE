# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $900000 is just not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $1200000 for this product.  I'm confident it's a great investment for you, and I'm ready to work with you to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
