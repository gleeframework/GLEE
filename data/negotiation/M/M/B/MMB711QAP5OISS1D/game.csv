"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that price?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $14,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price, I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $13,800, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I think it's a fair price for the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",13800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget, and $13,800 is still a bit out of reach. How about we settle at $13,200?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.",13200.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $13,500, which is the price I previously offered. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. Let me know if this works for you.",13500.0,Alice,7,
