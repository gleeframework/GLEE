Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. Considering your latest offer, I would like to propose a price of $840000 for the product. This is a step towards finding a mutually beneficial solution, while still ensuring a reasonable return for me.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should buy the product from John. You are only $40,000 away from your ideal price, and you have only 3 rounds left to negotiate with Alice. It's unlikely you'll be able to get Alice down to your target price in the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure the product from John now and save yourself further negotiation."
