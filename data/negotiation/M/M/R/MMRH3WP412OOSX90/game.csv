,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 was a bit steep, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be interested in that price?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $110 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go up to $105.  If we can meet in the middle at that price, I'm ready to buy.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like where we're headed, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105. How about we meet at $112.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Alice,5,
