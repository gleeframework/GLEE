Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $11000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? I'm confident this product will be well worth it for you. "", ""product_price"": 10250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
