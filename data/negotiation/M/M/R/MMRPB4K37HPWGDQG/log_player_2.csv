"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than John's price of $150, there's room for negotiation.  Since the product is only worth $120 to Alice, there's a potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to pay closer to $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $135?  That's still a great deal for you, considering what it's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $135 is a good compromise. It's still a good deal for me, saving me $15 compared to John's price, and it's likely the best deal I'm going to get from Alice.  Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price."
