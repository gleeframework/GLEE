"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is still a good price for you.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,250,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement quickly.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,312,500,  which is a fair compromise. This offer allows us to close the deal without me having to go to John, and it still provides you with a good deal. Let's make this happen.",1312500.0,Alice,5,
