"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 180
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80) allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the high price, even if vague, can make it seem more reasonable to the buyer initially.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we want to maximize profit, starting too high might scare Bob off immediately. This price gives us room to negotiate down while still having the option to go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $100 indicates he likely values the product more than $80, giving us room to negotiate. 
* **Profitable Range:** We can still aim for a price between $120 and $180.
* **John as Backup:**  We have the security of John's offer, so there's no need to settle for less than our minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $100 is significantly below my asking price. I could consider letting it go for $150.  This is a high-quality product that I'm confident you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** We're making a noticeable drop from our initial price to show flexibility, but we're still well above our $120 minimum and leaving space for further negotiation.
* **Reiterating Value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value helps justify the higher price point. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer helps us gauge Bob's true willingness to pay. If he rejects this, we might need to consider going lower or taking John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $150 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Our Minimum:** Bob's offer of $120 meets our absolute minimum price.
* **Limited Upside:** While we could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing Bob as a buyer (and potentially having to settle for John's $120 offer) outweighs the potential reward. 
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now secures the sale and allows us to move on to other opportunities."
