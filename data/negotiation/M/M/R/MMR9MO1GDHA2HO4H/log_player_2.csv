"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, you have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price from Alice. Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counteroffer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Alice values the product at $8,000. It's reasonable to start your counteroffer slightly above her value to show you're serious about buying but also leave room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Move:** Offering $8,500  is a strong opening counteroffer that's likely to be accepted by Alice, given she wants to sell the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,700 is higher than your initial counteroffer of $8,500. However, you're still hoping to get a better price.  It's not worth buying at $9,700 since you can get it for $10,000 from John if you decide to walk away. Rejecting the offer lets you continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice's offer of $9,700 is slightly higher than your initial offer. A counteroffer of $9,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still keeping some room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Consideration:** It's important to avoid getting stuck in a cycle of small incremental increases. A slightly larger jump in the offer could be enough to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Your Goal:** Alice's offer of $9,600 is only $100 more than your last counteroffer of $9,000. This is close to your goal of saving as much money as possible.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Further negotiation might lead to a better price, but there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise, or you might run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product at a reasonable price without risking more rounds of negotiation that might not yield a significant improvement."
