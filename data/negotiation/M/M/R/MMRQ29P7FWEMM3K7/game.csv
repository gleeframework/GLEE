,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your desire to save, $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still give you a significant savings compared to what the product is worth to you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  How about we meet at $1,000,000?  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  It's a significant savings for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
