# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's currently worth at least $800,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential value to you.  I understand you value it at $1,500,000, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Would you be interested in discussing a price in the range of $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
