"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a price that works for both parties. To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000.  This reflects its value and leaves room for negotiation.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I value your perspective, $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is my absolute bottom line. This still leaves a considerable profit for you, and it's a price I can accept.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price. However, I still need to make a substantial profit on this sale. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,075,000 is my final offer.  This gives you a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $1,025,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000, which is the best I can offer. This price allows me to make a reasonable profit, while still giving you a significant discount.  Let's close this deal!",1050000.0,Alice,7,
