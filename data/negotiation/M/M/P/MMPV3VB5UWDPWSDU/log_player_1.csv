Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate.  It also leaves you with a profit of $150,000, which is a decent amount considering your minimum price.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $700,000, it's significantly less than my minimum price of $800,000 and less than what John is offering. It's better to try and negotiate with Bob. I'm still confident I can get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also positions me closer to my target price of $950,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to come up to a price that is acceptable to me.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, John's offer guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob.  Selling to John is the most sensible decision at this point."
