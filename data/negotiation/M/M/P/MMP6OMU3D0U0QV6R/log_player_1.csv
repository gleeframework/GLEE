Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to $100 as possible, but I'm prepared to lower the price depending on Bob's response.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not quite ready to settle for $70, but I'm also aware that I could end up selling to John for $80 if I'm not careful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to what I'd like to receive. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept my offer.  If he doesn't, I'm prepared to keep negotiating, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind."
