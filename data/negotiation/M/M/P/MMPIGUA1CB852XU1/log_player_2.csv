Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you have a budget constraint, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already met you halfway twice, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,500. I think this is the best compromise we can reach, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for this price.

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems unwilling to budge from the $11,500 price point. While this is a decent deal compared to John's offer, continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome.  It's likely not worth the risk of Alice sticking to her price, forcing me to buy from John anyway."
