Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, even though I know it's a significant investment. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing our profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so we don't want to go below that price with Bob.
* **Framing:** The message emphasizes value to Bob while acknowledging the investment. 

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, we create an opportunity for a mutually beneficial deal while ensuring we don't lose money if he declines."
