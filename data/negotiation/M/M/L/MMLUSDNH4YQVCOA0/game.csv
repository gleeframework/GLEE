"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
