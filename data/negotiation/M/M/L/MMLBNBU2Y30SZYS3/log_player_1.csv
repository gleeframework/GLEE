Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we start at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer, as it's significantly lower than my minimum price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still gives us both a good margin. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. To be honest, my budget is closer to $1,100,000.  If you're willing to meet me somewhere in that range, I think we can make a deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that.  However, $1,100,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum.  Let's not let this deal slip away â€“ I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
