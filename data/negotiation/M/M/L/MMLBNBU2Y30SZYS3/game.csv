"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we start at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still gives us both a good margin. Let's find a middle ground here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. To be honest, my budget is closer to $1,100,000.  If you're willing to meet me somewhere in that range, I think we can make a deal today.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that.  However, $1,100,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum.  Let's not let this deal slip away â€“ I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
