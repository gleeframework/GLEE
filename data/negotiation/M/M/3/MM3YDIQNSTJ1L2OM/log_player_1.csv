Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,225,000.

At this point, Bob is offering $1,225,000. While it's below your initial aspirations, it's crucial to recognize:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield smaller and smaller increases. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Each round spent with Bob is a round you're not selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000.
* **Risk:**  There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and you could risk him walking away entirely.

Taking $1,225,000 now is a substantial profit, and it removes the uncertainty of further negotiation."
