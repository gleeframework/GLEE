Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob wants to counteroffer. It's important to start high, but not so high that it immediately scares him away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in buying, but I can only go up to $125. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell it for less than my minimum price of $150.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $125 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $150.  This is my absolute minimum, but it's still a good price for a product worth more than that. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but $150 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $137.50?  I'm really hoping to get this product, and that price would work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go lower.  I've already made concessions, and I'm confident that John will happily pay my minimum price. It's better to sell to John and secure a guaranteed $150 than to risk further negotiation with Bob that might lead to a lower price."
