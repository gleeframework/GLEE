,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in buying, but I can only go up to $125. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $125 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $150.  This is my absolute minimum, but it's still a good price for a product worth more than that. Let me know if you're interested.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $150 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $137.50?  I'm really hoping to get this product, and that price would work for me.",137.5,Bob,4,
