"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I can do $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a decent margin on this sale.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  How about we split the difference and do $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I've got to think about my bottom line. I can do $13,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin any further.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can see we're almost there. However, I still need to make a reasonable profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the value this product brings to the table.",13250.0,Alice,7,
