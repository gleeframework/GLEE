Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. $75 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's the best I can do right now.

However, I'd rather not pay more than $80 if I can help it. Since I've already made a counteroffer and Alice has rejected it, I'll try to negotiate a bit more. 

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.
