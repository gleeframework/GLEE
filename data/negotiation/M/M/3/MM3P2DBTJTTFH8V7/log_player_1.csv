Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am hoping to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a certain budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000. Let's split the difference. How about $975,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a chance to get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I still feel that $975,000 is a bit out of my budget. I would like to propose $960,000 as a potential compromise. This allows me to stay within my financial limits while still acknowledging the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $960,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm offering $965,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 965000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we could find common ground, Alice. However, I still feel that $965,000 might be a bit steep for my current budget. I would like to propose $960,000 once again. This is a significant improvement over our initial offers and should allow us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, his offer of $960,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate. It's better to secure the $1,200,000 from John and avoid the risk of a lower sale."
