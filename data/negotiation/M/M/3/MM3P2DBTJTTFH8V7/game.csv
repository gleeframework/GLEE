"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am hoping to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a certain budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000. Let's split the difference. How about $975,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a chance to get a fair price for my product.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I still feel that $975,000 is a bit out of my budget. I would like to propose $960,000 as a potential compromise. This allows me to stay within my financial limits while still acknowledging the value of your product.",960000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $960,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm offering $965,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",965000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we could find common ground, Alice. However, I still feel that $965,000 might be a bit steep for my current budget. I would like to propose $960,000 once again. This is a significant improvement over our initial offers and should allow us to reach an agreement.",960000.0,Bob,6,
