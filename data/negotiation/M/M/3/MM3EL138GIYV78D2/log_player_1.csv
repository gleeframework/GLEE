{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's still lower than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially earn more than John's offer while still maintaining a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $65 is a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough for me to make a good profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $80. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
