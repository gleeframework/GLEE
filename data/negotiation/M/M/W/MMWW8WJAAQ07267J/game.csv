"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a fair starting point.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer!  While I agree the product is impressive, that price point is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. This is still a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $700,000 is still a touch high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $600,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $650,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am interested in the product.  I could go up to $620,000, but that's really my limit.",620000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $620,000, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $640,000. This is a small increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",640000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I told you my limit is $620,000.  Take it or leave it.",620000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $620,000. I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $630,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your price, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to reconsider selling the product to someone else.",630000.0,Alice,9,
