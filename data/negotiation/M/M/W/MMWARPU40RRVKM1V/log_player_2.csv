**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, while John is asking for $1,500,000. 
* **You can save money:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though you are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, it's always beneficial to get the best price possible."
