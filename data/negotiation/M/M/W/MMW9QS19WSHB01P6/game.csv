"Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of a premium product like this. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for its value. How about we discuss $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I'd like to add some value to sweeten the deal. How about we include a premium service package worth $500, which would bring the total price to $11000?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I see you're trying to negotiate the price, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $10800, but I'd like to add a small concession. How about we throw in a one-year warranty, which is valued at $200, and bring the total price to $10000?",10000.0,Alice,7,
