"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a great asset to you. My initial price is $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. Offering $10,500 shows a willingness to negotiate while also establishing a clear starting point.
* **Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer leaves space for both parties to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Politeness:**  The message remains polite and emphasizes Bob's desire for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Bob is trying to get the product for the lowest price possible.  He's already gotten Alice to drop her price from $11,500 to $11,000, so there's still room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation moving towards Bob's desired price point.
* **Counter-Offer Potential:** By rejecting, Bob opens the door to make another counter-offer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $10,750.  This would allow us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a significant compromise from Bob's previous offer, showing a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Offering a price that's halfway between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer demonstrates fairness and a willingness to meet in the middle. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the benefits of this price for both parties, making the offer more appealing."
