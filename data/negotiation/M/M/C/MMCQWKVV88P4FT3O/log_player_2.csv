"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high, it's above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $10,000. While it is getting closer to your price, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to counter again before going with John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being willing to come down. $13,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'd be happy to pay $11,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product for $12,200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $10,000. At this point, it's more beneficial to go with John's offer of $10,000 and save yourself some money.  It's unlikely Alice will go any lower."
