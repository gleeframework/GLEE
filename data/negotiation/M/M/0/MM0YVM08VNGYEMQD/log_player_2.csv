"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than what Bob is willing to pay, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($80). This suggests there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be open to $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to push the price even lower."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $105?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** $108 is within Bob's budget of $150, and it's closer to his desired price than what John is offering.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and Bob has made a reasonable counteroffer. Accepting at this point avoids further negotiation and potential for a stalemate.
* **Value:** While $108 is still more than the product's worth to Alice ($80), it's a reasonable price for Bob considering he's saving $42 compared to buying from John."
