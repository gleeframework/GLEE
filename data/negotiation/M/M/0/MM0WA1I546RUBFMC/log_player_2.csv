"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to me, and I'm confident it'll be even more valuable for your business. I'm willing to part with it for $1200000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely do better.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm looking to secure it for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a possibility for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $1050000 is tempting, I'm still committed to getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that works for everyone. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject this offer and try to push for a price closer to $1,050,000.  He's still better off with Alice than John at this point, so continuing to negotiate makes sense."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,150,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to secure the product and you to still get a very fair price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
