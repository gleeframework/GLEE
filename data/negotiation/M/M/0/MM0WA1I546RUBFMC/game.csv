"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm looking to secure it for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for it.  Let me know if that's a possibility for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $1050000 is tempting, I'm still committed to getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that works for everyone.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  $1150000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $1100000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to secure the product and you to still get a very fair price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
