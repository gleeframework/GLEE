Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before anyone else. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he flatly refuses, we know he might be very price-sensitive. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Important:** This strategy assumes I have a little time. If I needed to sell the product *immediately*, offering it to Bob at $15,000 would guarantee a sale."
