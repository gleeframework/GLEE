Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob's offer:

While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob landing at $1,200,000 means he's recognizing the value. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer by pushing too hard. It also matches what John is willing to pay, guaranteeing the minimum acceptable profit."
