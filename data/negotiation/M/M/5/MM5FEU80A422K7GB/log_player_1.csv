"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a lower price in the next round, still aiming for a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm dropping the price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a substantial profit. This should encourage Bob to continue negotiating, hopefully leading to a deal closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired profit margin.  I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
