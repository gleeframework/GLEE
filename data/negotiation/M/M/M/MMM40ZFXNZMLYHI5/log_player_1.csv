Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he has a potential profit margin of $200,000 if he gets a good deal. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer, and you don't know if he'll get a better offer elsewhere.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but leave Bob with a potential profit that's enticing enough for him to accept. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It secures you a $150,000 profit above your minimum and leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 gain.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Focus on Value, Not Just Price:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""return on investment"" shifts the focus from the price tag to the potential benefits for Bob. 

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to slightly adjust your price, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Confidence is Key:** Present your offer with confidence. If Bob senses hesitation, he's more likely to push for a lower price."
