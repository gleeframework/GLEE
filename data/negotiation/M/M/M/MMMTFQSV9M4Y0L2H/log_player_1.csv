{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than my minimum but leaves room for some bargaining.  It also expresses confidence in the value of the product for Bob, which could encourage him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $10,500? I'm really interested in the product, and this is my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet.  There's still potential for a higher price, especially since he said he's interested in the product. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $11,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
