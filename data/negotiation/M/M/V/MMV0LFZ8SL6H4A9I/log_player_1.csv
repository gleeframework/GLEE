# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1200000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can come closer to my desired price.  $1,200,000 is too low for me right now.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
