"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That initial price is a little high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet halfway at $1,650,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit too high for my budget.  I can go up to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair offer.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. I understand this is a significant investment for you. I'm willing to accept a slight reduction to $1,450,000.  This offer reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your position.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has rejected your final offer of $1,000,000. It's unlikely she'll come down significantly from $1,450,000, especially since you've signaled your maximum willingness to pay.  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. Continuing the negotiation with Alice has a low chance of success and risks losing the product to another buyer."
