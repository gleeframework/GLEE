"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $700,000? That's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still pushing my budget.  My final offer is $750,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
