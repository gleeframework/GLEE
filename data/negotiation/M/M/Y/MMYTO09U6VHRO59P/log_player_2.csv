"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's potential to save more.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get it for a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original offer, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll pay $825,000.  This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $835,000. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While I'd prefer to pay less, at this point, the difference between $835,000 and my target price is small enough that it's worth accepting the offer and avoiding further negotiation.  It's also important to consider that John is selling the product for $1,000,000, so this is a much better deal."
