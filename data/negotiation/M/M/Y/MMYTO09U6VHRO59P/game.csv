"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get it for a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll pay $825,000.  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $835,000. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",835000.0,Alice,5,
