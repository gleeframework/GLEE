Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000 and my minimum acceptable price is also $10,000, I want to start with a significantly higher offer to explore potential for a higher profit margin. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The $15,000 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, giving me a better understanding of his price limit.
* **Backup option:**  I'm comfortable with the risk that Bob might reject this initial offer. I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, ensuring I don't lose out."
