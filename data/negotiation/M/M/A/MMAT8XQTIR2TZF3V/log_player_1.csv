{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It's also lower than my minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $120 and even significantly lower than my initial offer of $110.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $65 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I have a strict budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $110. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I will aim for a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise at $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're truly serious about buying it, I'm open to finalizing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 85}
