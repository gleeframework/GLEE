"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $9,000. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know if this works for you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
