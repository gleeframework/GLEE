"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations with a strong offer that's slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,400,000 is a significant markup from Alice's minimum acceptable price, but it also acknowledges that Bob values the product at a higher price point. 
* **Open Communication:** The message encourages open dialogue and negotiation, fostering a positive and collaborative atmosphere from the start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob clearly sees value in the product, and there's room to meet closer to the middle ground. Accepting now would leave potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It's clear we both see the value in this product.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding the Middle Ground:**  By proposing $1,350,000, Alice demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's significantly above her minimum. 
* **Compromise and Fairness:** Emphasizing a ""fair compromise"" aims to maintain a positive tone and encourages Bob to see the offer as mutually beneficial.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  A counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward,  signaling that Alice is serious about reaching a deal."
