"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** Bob is offering a price that's still above Alice's minimum but significantly lower than her initial offer. This shows good faith and signals a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer, emphasizing the product's value to him, making his offer more persuasive.
* **Openness to discussion:** Bob ends by inviting Alice to discuss the counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open and avoiding a potential stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It's clear we both see the value in this product.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
