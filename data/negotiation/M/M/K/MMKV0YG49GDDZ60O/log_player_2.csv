"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and bring significant value to your organization. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is good, but it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob wants to save as much as possible and shouldn't jump at the first offer. There are 10 rounds, so there is room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  Would you be open to that price?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there is still room for negotiation.  Bob has 8 rounds remaining and should continue to aim for a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to go to $825,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $825000, which would be $837500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price. Bob has 6 rounds remaining and should keep pushing for a lower price. While the current offer is tempting, Bob can likely get a better deal if he keeps negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still feeling a bit stretched at $837,500.  How about $830,000? This would allow me to finalize the purchase and get this product into my business."", ""product_price"": 830000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to finalize the purchase, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $830000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $837500 and $830000, which would be $833750. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $833,750.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $833,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $833,750 is a good price for Bob. While he would love to get it even lower, he has only 3 rounds left. It's a good deal, and the risk of continuing negotiations is that Alice might get more stubborn or even raise her price.  The chance of finding a much better deal in the remaining rounds is low."
