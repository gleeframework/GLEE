"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong opening offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a firm stance. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's potential desire for a profitable acquisition.
* **Anchoring:** This high initial offer acts as an anchor, potentially influencing Bob's counteroffers to be higher than if I started with a lower price.

By starting high, I aim to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and leave space for strategic concessions in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I know I have a guaranteed offer from John at that minimum, so there's no reason to accept a lower amount yet.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if I can negotiate Bob closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is reasonable, the product's true value goes beyond that. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,750,000."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've significantly reduced my price from the initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** I'm reinforcing the product's value to justify a price above Bob's offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The new offer is halfway between my initial price and Bob's offer, aiming for a potential agreement closer to my desired outcome. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to counter again while still keeping the price significantly above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now $100,000 above my guaranteed sale price with John. While I could try to push for more, there's a risk Bob will lower his offer or walk away in future rounds. Accepting now secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
