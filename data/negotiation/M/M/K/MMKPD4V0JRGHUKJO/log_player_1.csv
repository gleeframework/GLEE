Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I believe it's a fantastic deal and I'm eager to find it a good home. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible, without going below her own minimum ($12,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, so she can afford to be a little bolder with her initial offer to Bob. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible outcome with Bob while ensuring Alice doesn't lose money if the negotiation fails."
