Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's still a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $120, so I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering at $130. This is still a significant markup from Bob's offer of $100, but it's also a compromise from my initial offer of $150. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate while also ensuring I still get a reasonable price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob is not willing to budge from his $100 offer, and that's simply too low for me.  I'm willing to sell to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob."
