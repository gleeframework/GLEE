Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, she can afford to start the negotiation significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring she doesn't settle for less than John's offer.
* **Justification for the price:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth even more to Bob in the long run.
* **Open-ended question:** Ending with ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in a dialogue rather than just saying yes or no. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market research:** While not provided in the prompt, knowing the typical market value for similar products would inform a more realistic offer. 
* **Bob's personality:** If Alice knows Bob is particularly price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more strategic.  
* **Negotiation skills:** This is just the opening offer. Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate and potentially lower the price, but never below her minimum of $800,000."
