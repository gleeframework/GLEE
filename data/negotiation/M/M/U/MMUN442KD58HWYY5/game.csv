"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit steep for me right now. How about we try something around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $90?  This is a great price for the quality and value of the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $60 is quite a bit lower. I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget. Could you maybe do $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $85. This is a very fair price for a product of this quality.",85.0,Alice,5,
