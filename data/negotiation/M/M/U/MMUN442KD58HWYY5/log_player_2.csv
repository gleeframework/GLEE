Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $85. This is a very fair price for a product of this quality.

Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and your goal is to spend no more than $80. It's time to cut negotiations and buy from John."
