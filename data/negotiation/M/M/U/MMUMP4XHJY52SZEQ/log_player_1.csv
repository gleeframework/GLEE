"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really appreciate. My starting price is $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also conveys a willingness to be flexible and to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is a better offer than John's $80, it's still below your minimum desired profit.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than your initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. It demonstrates flexibility while still ensuring a good profit. The message also reiterates the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is tempting, it's still below your desired profit margin. You've already negotiated down significantly from your initial price, but it's worth seeing if Bob will budge further.  You have more rounds to explore, and there's still a chance to close the deal at a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a little more, to $105. This is a final offer from me, so I hope you'll consider it carefully."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a final attempt to get a deal that's closer to your desired price. It's a small compromise from your previous offer, but it still ensures you get a profit. The message emphasizes that this is your final offer, creating a sense of urgency and pressure for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $98, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $98 is close to your minimum profit, it's still not quite enough. It's better to continue negotiating with Bob, who seems willing to budge, than to sell to John for $80. You have a few rounds left, and you can potentially get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $98 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $100. This would give us both a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a slight compromise from your previous offer but still above your minimum desired profit. It's important to remain firm in your desired price range while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints. The message emphasizes a fair deal for both parties, increasing the chances of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $97.50, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are now in round 8, with only 2 rounds left.  Bob's offer of $97.50 is very close to your minimum desired profit, but it's still not quite enough to make it worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  

You've already shown flexibility and willingness to compromise. With limited rounds remaining, it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly higher offer from Bob. 

Selling to John for $80 is the safer choice. It guarantees you at least your minimum profit and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob."
