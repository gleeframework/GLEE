,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $98 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $100. This would give us both a fair deal. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,7,
