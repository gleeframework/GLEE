# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the maximum amount Bob is willing to pay.  There is no benefit to accepting her offer.  Bob can get the same product from John for the same price. Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, he should reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
