"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still higher than what John is offering. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed to buy from John at a better price."
