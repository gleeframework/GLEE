"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something truly special, and I believe it has immense value to you. My initial offer is $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price given the product's worth. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about offering the product for $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However,  $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that considers your interests while still allowing me to make a profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
