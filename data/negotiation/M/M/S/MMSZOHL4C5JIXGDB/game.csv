"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer.  While $115 is better, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference again and land at $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum of $120. How about we meet at $110? That's as low as I can go.",110.0,Alice,5,
