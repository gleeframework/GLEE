Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm prepared to offer $750,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
