"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves some room for negotiation.  It's important to establish a strong starting point to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell yet. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility while still remaining above Bob's perceived value.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to counter with a higher offer, bringing us closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  $925,000 is closer to Bob's value, but I can potentially do better. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm dropping my price again to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my last offer, showing a willingness to compromise. However, it's still above Bob's latest offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  I hope this will be enough to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time and Bob's offers are getting closer to his perceived value, not mine.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a good profit and avoids further risk of a lower offer from Bob."
