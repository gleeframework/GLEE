"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product at a price that reflects its value and leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves room for profit for both of us.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still not quite where I need to be. To show you my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop to $1,075,000. This is a significant concession, and I hope you'll see the value in accepting this offer. Let's close this deal, and both of us can move on to bigger and better things.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,025,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do. I hope you'll reconsider and take this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one final concession, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make a last-ditch effort to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll offer $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll reconsider and take it.",1020000.0,Bob,8,
