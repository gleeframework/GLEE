Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're presenting, $14,000 is slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This price is still within your profit margin and reflects the value I see in it. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
