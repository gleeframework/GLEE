"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're presenting, $14,000 is slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This price is still within your profit margin and reflects the value I see in it. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",12500.0,Bob,2,
