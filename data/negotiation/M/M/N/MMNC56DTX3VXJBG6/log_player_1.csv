"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging that Bob values the product higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value of $8,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm countering with $10,000. This is still above my minimum value but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's also closer to Bob's offer, hopefully encouraging him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum value of $8,000 and it's the best offer I've received so far. It's risky to keep negotiating as we are already in Round 4 and I'm worried that I might not get a better offer, especially if I keep rejecting offers and risk losing Bob."
