""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the immense benefits you'll reap."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a little high. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's good to know he's interested, accepting a price that's $150,000 less than my minimum is not a good starting point for negotiation.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects what it brings to the table.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is slowly increasing his offers, but he's still significantly under my minimum.  I need to hold firm and see if I can bring him closer to $800,000. I'll counter again."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a tough decision point! Let's analyze:

* **Bob's latest offer:** $780,000
* **My minimum:** $800,000
* **John's offer:** $800,000

Bob is getting closer, and there's a chance he might be willing to go a bit higher. However, there's also a risk he might stall out below my minimum. 

Given we still have rounds to negotiate, the safer option is to reject Bob's offer and propose a counter that nudges him closer to my minimum.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To finalize the deal, I can offer $795,000. This represents a significant investment from me, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a critical juncture in the negotiation. Let's break down the options:

1. **Accept Bob's offer:** This nets $795,000, which is only slightly below my minimum and a good profit. However, there's a chance Bob might go a tiny bit higher if pushed.

2. **Reject and counter:** This risks Bob sticking to his price or even losing interest. We only have two rounds left, which isn't much room for significant movement.

3. **Sell to John:** This guarantees my minimum of $800,000. It's the safest option, but I might be leaving a bit of money on the table if Bob is truly willing to go higher.

**Decision:**

While risky, I believe Bob is very close to my minimum and might be willing to budge slightly. I'll take a calculated risk.

```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'll use the next round to signal that I'm firm but open to a minor compromise. If Bob meets me halfway, I'll take the deal. If not, I'll sell to John to secure my minimum."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  Your offer is strong, and I'm ready to close this deal.  Let's finalize this at $802,500. This demonstrates my commitment to a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 802500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer:

* **Splits the difference:** It meets Bob halfway between his last offer ($795,000) and my desired minimum ($800,000).
* **Signals firmness:** It shows Bob I'm willing to compromise slightly but am firm on getting a price above $800,000. 
* **Creates urgency:** With only one round left, it encourages Bob to make a final decision.

This is a calculated risk, but it provides the best chance of maximizing profit while still having the safety net of John's offer if Bob refuses."
