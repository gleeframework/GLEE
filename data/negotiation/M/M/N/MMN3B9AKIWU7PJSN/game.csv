"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a little high. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects what it brings to the table.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
