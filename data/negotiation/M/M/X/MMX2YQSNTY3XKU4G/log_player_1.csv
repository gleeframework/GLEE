"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price ($1,500,000) to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This allows for room to negotiate and gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. I believe there's still potential for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,350,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob that allows for a good profit without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $1,250,000, which is a good price. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a reasonable offer and I'm confident that I can't get significantly higher. It's also important to note that I only have 10 rounds to close the deal, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to Bob.  Accepting his offer is the best choice at this point."
