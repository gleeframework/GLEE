"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $7,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $8,250. I'm still a bit hesitant, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,800. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While your offer is closer, $7,800 is still a little lower than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell the product for $8,000.  This way, we both get a good deal.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
