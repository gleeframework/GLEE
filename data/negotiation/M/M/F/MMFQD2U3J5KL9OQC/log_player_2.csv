I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,200,000.

Alice has come down to her minimum price, which is the same price John is offering.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice, as she's unlikely to budge further.  It's best to buy from John at this point."
