Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could offer it for slightly less, aiming for $12,000 allows for a potential $4,000 profit over what John offers.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message hints at a limited-time offer and piques Bob's interest by highlighting the product's suitability for him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob tries to negotiate down, there's a buffer to still land above John's offer. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit from Bob while acknowledging the safety net of John's offer."
