"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Offering $950,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer and is still a profitable deal for Alice, considering her value of $1,000,000.  This counteroffer shows Bob's commitment to negotiation while still demonstrating a willingness to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is now within Bob's acceptable range.  While he would prefer a lower price, the potential for further negotiation is uncertain, and it's risky to continue given the limited rounds.  Accepting the offer guarantees a purchase at a good price, saving Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John."
