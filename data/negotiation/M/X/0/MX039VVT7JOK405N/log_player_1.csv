Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for presenting your offer. While I acknowledge the product's potential value, the price point you've proposed is significantly higher than I'm willing to consider. I'd be interested in exploring a deal closer to $1,000,000. I believe this would be a fair offer reflecting a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. However, I can't justify going higher than $1,150,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options.

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet Alice's price expectations.  While she could continue negotiating, there's a real risk Bob will walk away, leaving her with no deal.  Selling to John guarantees the $1,200,000, which is a reasonable outcome given the circumstances. It's better to secure a solid offer than risk ending up with nothing."
