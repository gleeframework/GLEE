"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($100) and John's offer ($100). There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This:

* **Signals our budget:** It makes it clear we're not easily swayed by the initial high price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  We don't want to start too high and limit our bargaining power.
* **Stays above half of Alice's valuation:** Offering something closer to half of her perceived value ($120) might be seen as too low and offend her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $110. Let me know if that's more to your liking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer of $110 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still above both our budget and what John offers. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $110 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging progress:** We start by showing Alice we recognize her movement on the price.
* **Firm but fair:** $90 is a significant jump from our previous offer, but still well within a reasonable range and below Alice's $120 perceived value. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will give us a better read on how low Alice is willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $105. That's the lowest I can go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down considerably and is now only $5 above John's price. It's unlikely we'll get a better deal from Alice, and continuing to negotiate risks her accepting a deal with another buyer. Accepting at $105 gets us the product while still saving us some money compared to her original offer."
