,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go to $108.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",108.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $108 is still below what I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $110. It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
