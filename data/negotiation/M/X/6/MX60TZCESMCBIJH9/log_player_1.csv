Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Giving Bob a little room to negotiate is crucial. 
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This provides you with a buffer to potentially make concessions if needed.
* **It shows you're serious about selling:**  It's not a ridiculous opening price that would immediately make Bob walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  You haven't conceded to his lowball offer, demonstrating you're not desperate. 
* **Potentially secure a higher price:**  By making a counteroffer, you can try to bridge the gap and get closer to your desired price. 
* **Assess Bob's seriousness:**  How he responds to your counteroffer will reveal his true interest and budget limitations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  This offer is a compromise that moves closer to Bob's price while still being above your minimum.
* **Maintaining firmness:**  It's not a drastic concession, showing you're still confident in the product's worth.
* **Encouraging further negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for continued discussion and potentially a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit shy of your last offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $8200. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While still below your ideal price, $8,200 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or even a lower price.
* **Opportunity cost:** Holding out for a higher price could lead to lost time and the risk of Bob walking away or finding a better deal elsewhere.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a decent profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale entirely."
