"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for the best possible price.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm going to see if he bites. If he doesn't, I can adjust my price in subsequent rounds.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still aiming for more.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I'm hoping this will show him I'm willing to negotiate, but still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now getting close to my desired price point and I'm running out of time.  Accepting his offer will give me a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  There's a chance I could get a slightly higher price, but I'm not willing to risk losing the deal.  I'm also factoring in the cost of potential future rounds and the risk of John changing his mind.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
