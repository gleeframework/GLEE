Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Negotiating Room:** The $11,500 offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested while still staying above your minimum. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob directly might be faster than waiting for John, even if the price difference is small."
