Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really like it! I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is well above Bob's perceived value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and potentially more likely to negotiate.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm phrasing it as a question to give Bob the impression that I'm open to hearing his thoughts and potentially adjusting the price. 
* **John as a safety net:** I'm keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, ensuring I can always get at least my minimum price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $100 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for better negotiation:** I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer and continuing the negotiation. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $150, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $100 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $120? That's still a good deal for you, and I think it's fair for me."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate by lowering my price from $130 to $120.
* **Fair offer:** $120 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than my minimum price and more than his perceived value.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining my reasoning for the counteroffer, making it seem more fair and reasonable. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm still aware of John's offer, which gives me the confidence to stand my ground if Bob continues to refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $110. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $110 is getting closer to my minimum of $150, it's still a significant difference. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob has already shown a willingness to increase his offer.
* **John's offer is a strong backup:** Knowing I can always sell to John for $150 gives me the confidence to keep pushing for a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $120 or $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's getting closer. However, I'm still not quite there.  Could you meet me at $115? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I think we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between Bob's last offer of $110 and my previous offer of $120.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Emphasizing compromise:** I'm using language like ""good compromise"" to highlight that I'm willing to meet Bob halfway.
* **Finality:** I'm suggesting this is a good opportunity to finalize the deal, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I'm still aware of John's offer, which gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob continues to refuse."
