Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,500.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 15500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still end up with a price you're happy with.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message hints at its value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning that you'll list the product publicly if Bob declines, you subtly introduce a sense of urgency and the possibility of him missing out.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""Let me know what you think"" opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, starting the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that's potentially attractive compared to an unknown public listing price."
