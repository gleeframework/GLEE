Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $150.  I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $160, which would be $140. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $150 yet.  I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high at $140.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $150, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $150, which would be $135. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum price.  I've had six rounds of negotiations and I'm getting the feeling Bob isn't going to budge much further.  Rather than continue to negotiate and risk losing more time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. It's a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum price."
