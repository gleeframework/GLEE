"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, I am only willing to pay $1600000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the current market conditions. I look forward to your response.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1600000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000, recognizing your budget and market conditions. This price still allows for a healthy return on investment for you. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and the market potential, but I am still unable to meet at $1700000. I would like to propose $1650000 as a counteroffer. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
