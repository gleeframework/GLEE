Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,900 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference at $8,800? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

``` 
This is a good opportunity to secure a decent price while avoiding any more rounds of potentially fruitless negotiation.  While $8,800 is slightly below your initial goal, it's still a better deal than selling to John."
