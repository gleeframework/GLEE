{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:**  This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value of $12,000, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, while also highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I aim to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he's truly interested, he might be willing to negotiate down from this price. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This gives me flexibility to accept a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point.

**Next steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and the risk of him walking away. If his offer is too low, I'll counter back or sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 meets my minimum requirement, it's still quite a bit lower than my desired price.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more profitable deal. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counter-offer that is closer to my ideal price point. This gives me more control over the negotiation and potentially earns me a higher price.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm aiming for a higher profit.

**Next Steps:**

I will analyze Bob's initial interest and how likely he is to negotiate further. I'll craft a counteroffer that is still appealing to Bob while also getting me closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a bit lower than where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to continue the negotiations.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm offering $15,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Positive message:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and emphasizing the value proposition for Bob, hoping to encourage further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Middle ground:** By offering a middle ground, I'm showing flexibility and attempting to find a compromise.
* **Appealing to Bob:** The ""great deal"" language emphasizes value, potentially increasing Bob's willingness to accept.

**Next steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's counteroffer (if any). 
* **Prepare for further negotiation:**  I'll be ready to make additional concessions or counter-offers if necessary, all while keeping my minimum price and John's offer as my backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $15000 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is closer to my desired price point, and it's only slightly less than the guaranteed $12,000 I could get from John. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing risk:** By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that is just above my minimum acceptable price. This minimizes the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower offer.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, and the outcome is uncertain.  Accepting Bob's offer is a more efficient use of my time.

**Next Steps:**

While I'm happy with this sale, I will be mindful of this experience for future negotiations. It demonstrates the importance of considering the potential for further negotiation and the value of a guaranteed outcome."
