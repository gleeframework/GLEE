"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering. There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me.  $10,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000,  which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $9,000 is closer to what I need.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $9,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob. 
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $9,500.
* **Potential Savings:**  This offer saves Bob $2,500 compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation:** While Bob might be able to negotiate a bit lower, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and the potential for more back-and-forth negotiations outweigh the potential for a slightly better price.

It's generally a good idea to accept offers that are significantly better than the alternative, even if there's a chance of getting an even better deal later."
