"Hello Alice, I understand your position and respect the value of the product. However, given the current market conditions and my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $825,000. I would like to propose an offer of $775,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.",775000.0,Bob,4,
