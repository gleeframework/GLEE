"Bob, I understand you're looking to save money, but my product is worth a lot more than $9,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and my need to make a profit.  Let's finalize this deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
