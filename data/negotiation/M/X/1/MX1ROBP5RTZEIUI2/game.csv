"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm now offering it to you for $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800,000. I've already made some significant concessions, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $800,000, so I'm now offering it to you for $825,000.",825000.0,Alice,7,
