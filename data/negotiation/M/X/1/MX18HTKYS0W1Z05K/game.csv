"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12000?  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500. Let's find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9500 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $10750. This is a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10000? It's a fair compromise and allows us to reach a deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
