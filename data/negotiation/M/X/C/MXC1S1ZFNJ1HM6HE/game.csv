,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $98? That's a fair price for both of us.",98.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not quite comfortable with $98, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll sell it to you for $107. It's the best I can do.",107.0,Alice,5,
