Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite comfortable with $98, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll sell it to you for $107. It's the best I can do.

It's clear Alice is not going to budge much further.  It's unlikely we'll get a price significantly better than $107.  Buying from John for $120 makes more sense at this point to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing out on the product entirely."
