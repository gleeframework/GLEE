"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for cheaper than $12,000. Alice wants to sell the product for at least $10,000. There's room for negotiation. You should counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum selling price, giving her an incentive to negotiate. This gives you a chance to see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer increased from $12,000 to $12,500. While it's still below your maximum price point of $15,000, it's getting closer.  Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. Since there's still room for negotiation (Alice's minimum is $10,000), you can try to push for a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your limit, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This counteroffer is a compromise, increasing your previous offer but still under her latest proposal. It shows you're willing to meet halfway while also pushing for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still within your budget but getting closer to your maximum.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can secure a lower price. You can still potentially get a better deal than $13,000, and it's not yet worth taking the risk of going to John, who is selling at a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to what you're willing to pay, but there's still a chance to get it lower. This counteroffer is a compromise, increasing your offer again but still below her latest proposal. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate, while also potentially getting a better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum, and it's unlikely that you'll be able to get it much lower through further negotiation. While buying from John would guarantee you a fixed price, Alice's offer is significantly cheaper.  It's a good deal, and accepting it saves you $1,500 compared to buying from John."
