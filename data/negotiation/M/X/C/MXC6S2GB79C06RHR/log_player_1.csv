"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm starting significantly higher than my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique features"" and ""potential,"" I'm aiming to pique Bob's interest and nudge him to consider the value beyond his initial assessment.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I have a guaranteed offer from John, my goal is to maximize profit. I'll use John's offer as leverage if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own perceived value. Accepting now would mean a substantial loss.  I need to steer the negotiation closer to a price point that's beneficial for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Interest:**  I want to maintain a positive negotiation environment and show I'm willing to work towards a deal.
* **Justifying the High Price:** I'm reiterating that the product has value beyond Bob's initial perception without explicitly revealing my minimum price.
* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** I'm making a substantial drop from my initial offer to show flexibility, but it's still above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1,700,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's still significantly below my minimum.  I need to hold firm and signal that I'm not desperate to sell at any price. I'll counteroffer with a smaller concession this time to apply a bit more pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000.  However, I do have other interested parties, and I need to see a price that reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  My previous drop was substantial, this time I'm conceding less to signal that I'm reaching my limit.
* **Introducing Competition (John):** By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" I'm subtly introducing the presence of John (without naming him) to create a sense of urgency and opportunity cost for Bob.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm continuing to reinforce that the product is worth more than Bob's current offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but I'm a serious buyer, too. To show you I'm ready to deal, I can go up to $1,200,000. That's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has explicitly stated that $1,200,000 is his absolute limit.  
* **Unlikely to Bridge the Gap:**  Even with further negotiation, it's improbable that Bob will come close to my $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer from John at my desired price. Continuing with Bob risks a lower final price or a failed negotiation that leaves me with less time to close with John.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
