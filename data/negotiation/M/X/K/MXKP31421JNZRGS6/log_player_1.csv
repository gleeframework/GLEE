"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a strong offer that reflects the product's high value to both parties. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation.
* **Not Too Aggressive:**  While I want to maximize my profit, demanding a price too close to $1,500,000 might make Bob feel like there's no room for negotiation and could lead to an immediate rejection.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message emphasizes openness to negotiation, indicating flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this product has great value, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is substantial, it's still significantly lower than my target price and his perceived value of the product. I believe there's room for negotiation. 

By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm seeking a price that more accurately reflects the product's worth. It allows me to propose a counter-offer closer to my desired outcome in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a significant investment, the true value of this product goes beyond that.  I could consider coming down to $1,350,000.  I believe this price point reflects the value it would bring to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's price range but still aiming high. This counter-offer represents a compromise while keeping the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value proposition to justify the higher price and help Bob understand the potential return on his investment. 
* **Remaining Flexible:** I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm signaling that I'm looking for a price point closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,250,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,325,000? I believe this price point is more in line with my budget and would allow us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a strong compromise. Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Significant Profit:** This price is well above my minimum ($1,000,000) and represents a healthy profit margin.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has met me closer to my price range. Accepting shows good faith and a desire to close the deal.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome.

While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of losing the deal and settling for John's offer of $1,000,000 isn't worth it at this point."
