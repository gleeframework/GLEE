"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this product has great value, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a significant investment, the true value of this product goes beyond that.  I could consider coming down to $1,350,000.  I believe this price point reflects the value it would bring to your operations.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,250,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,325,000? I believe this price point is more in line with my budget and would allow us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
