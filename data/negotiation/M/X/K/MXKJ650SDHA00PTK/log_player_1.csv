"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  By sending a message, you're also opening the communication and showing a willingness to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. You can still try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiation, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $108 is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still not enough. You have time and another option (selling to John), so you should continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $112, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $109 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close to the end of the rounds. You've tried to negotiate with Bob, but he's not willing to meet your minimum price.  With John offering you your minimum price, it's time to sell to him and avoid risking getting a lower price or losing out on the deal entirely."
