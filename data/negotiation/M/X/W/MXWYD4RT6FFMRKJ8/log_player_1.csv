Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 90} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $100, so starting at $90 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring a significant gain if he accepts.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower offer might tempt Bob, but it also leaves space for him to counter-offer and meet you somewhere in the middle, still above your minimum.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John gives you leverage. You're not desperate, allowing you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
