Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, there's room to negotiate a price higher than John's offer of $800,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 leaves a significant profit margin for Alice while still being a compelling deal for Bob, saving him $75,000.
* **Time Constraint:**  Adding a 24-hour time limit creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale with Bob, the buyer who values the product more."
