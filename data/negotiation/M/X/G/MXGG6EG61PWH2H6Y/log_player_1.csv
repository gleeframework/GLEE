Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant profit for me, and I believe it's a reasonable starting point given the product's value to Bob. I'll keep John as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm going to reject it for now and try to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a good compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's. I hope this will be enough to entice Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,220,000 is only $20,000 less than what John is offering.  It's a small difference, and I'm willing to take it to finalize the deal with Bob."
