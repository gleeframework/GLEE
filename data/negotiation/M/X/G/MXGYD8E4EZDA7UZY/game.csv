"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
