Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $13,000 is still a bit low for me. My product is unique and offers a value that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
