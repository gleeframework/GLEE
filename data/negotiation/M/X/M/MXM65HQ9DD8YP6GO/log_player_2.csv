"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but there's room for negotiation.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its value,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still make a good profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the extra $100,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer a lower price, accepting her offer at $1,100,000 saves me $400,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal for me and a reasonable compromise."
