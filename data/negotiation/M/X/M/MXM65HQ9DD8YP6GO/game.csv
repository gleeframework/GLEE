"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its value,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still make a good profit.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the extra $100,000. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
