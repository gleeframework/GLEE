Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $150 asking price is a significant markup but not so high that it would immediately scare Bob away.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could offer a lower price. However, starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counters."
