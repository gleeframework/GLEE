{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price. I will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I will reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $82.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make an offer of $79. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm running out of rounds.  It's more likely that Bob will continue to make lower offers, and I risk getting stuck with a price below my minimum. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, which is my best strategy at this point."
