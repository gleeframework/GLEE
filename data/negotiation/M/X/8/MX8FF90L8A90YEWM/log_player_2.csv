Alice's offer is too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be interested in purchasing for $100. This is my maximum budget, and I'm sure we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $130?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob! I appreciate that. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $125 is getting closer to my budget, but it's still above my maximum. At this point, I'm not confident I can negotiate her down any further. To avoid the risk of going over my budget, I'll go ahead and purchase the product from John for $100."
