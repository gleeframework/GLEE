"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $100 and leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to Bob than to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm counteroffering at $112. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still leaves some room for him to come up. I want to keep the negotiations moving and show that I'm willing to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to my target price, Bob's offer of $109 is close enough to my minimum price of $100. It's also better than selling to John for $100.  I'm accepting his offer to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation rounds."
