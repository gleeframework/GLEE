"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and importance, I am proposing a price of $15,000 for it. This reflects not only its worth but also the opportunity cost for us in terms of time and resources invested. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a better price.  It's likely that Alice will be willing to negotiate given her own value for the product is $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $15,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which aligns with its value to me.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
