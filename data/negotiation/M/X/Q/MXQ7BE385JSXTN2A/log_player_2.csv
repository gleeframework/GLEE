Round 3

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I can meet you in the middle at $10,500. Would you be willing to go for that?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a target price, but so do I.  I can offer $10,000, but I can't go any higher. It's a fair offer."",

Alice is clearly committed to small increments. We're getting close to the point where we may need to concede a bit to avoid going over budget with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting very close to what I'm willing to spend.  I could stretch my budget to $10,250, but that's absolutely my limit."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really trying to make this work. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I'm starting to get a bit anxious about selling to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options. What's your final decision? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is playing hardball and her latest offer is too close to John's price. It's unlikely we'll get her much lower, and we risk exceeding our budget. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
