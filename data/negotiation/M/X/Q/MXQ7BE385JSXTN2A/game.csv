"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I can meet you in the middle at $10,500. Would you be willing to go for that?",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about buying the product, but $9,750 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is my best price for now. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have a target price, but so do I.  I can offer $10,000, but I can't go any higher. It's a fair offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your target price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, which is my next best price. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I think this product is worth it to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is getting very close to what I'm willing to spend.  I could stretch my budget to $10,250, but that's absolutely my limit.",10250.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really trying to make this work. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I'm starting to get a bit anxious about selling to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options. What's your final decision?",11500.0,Alice,9,
