"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. How about $9,750?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,5,
