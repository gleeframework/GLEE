Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product while still leaving me with a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $1,450,000? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, I'm still not at my minimum. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can close the deal soon."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to drop my price to $1,500,000. This is my absolute minimum, but I really believe in the value of this product for you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we've already gone through several rounds.  I'm starting to run out of time and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether.  John is a sure thing at $1,500,000, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
