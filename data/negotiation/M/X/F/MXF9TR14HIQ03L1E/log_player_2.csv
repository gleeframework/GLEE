"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,100,000. This is a significant overpayment.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $850,000, which is still below his maximum price of $800,000 but represents a significant step towards Alice's asking price. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate.  It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price. He can still potentially get a better deal than John's offer, especially if Alice is motivated to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer to $900,000. This shows he is willing to compromise, but still trying to stay within his budget.  It's a reasonable offer that might entice Alice to accept, especially if she's willing to meet Bob halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has only lowered her price by $25,000.  While it's a small improvement, it's still significantly higher than Bob's maximum price. It's likely Alice is unwilling to go lower, and continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better deal.  At this point, buying from John for $800,000 is the most financially sensible option."
