"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages that the market doesn't fully reflect yet. Would you consider $17,000? It's a compromise that recognizes its worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I still think $17,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
