"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth at least $100 to me, and I'm offering it to you for $125.  Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $125 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  How about $110?  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? That feels fair to both of us.",117.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $117.50 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",115.0,Bob,4,
