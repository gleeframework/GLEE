"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $787,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",787500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle on $750,000?  That would work well for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above $750,000 in my valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, which is a compromise between our two numbers. This is my final offer, so I hope we can agree on this price.",775000.0,Alice,5,
