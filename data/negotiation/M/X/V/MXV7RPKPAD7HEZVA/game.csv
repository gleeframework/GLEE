"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth even more in your hands. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'd like to pay right now.  How about $12,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  While I value your business, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a good price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal quickly.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $12,500? I think that's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is still below what I need to make this worth it for me. I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $12,750? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for you.",12750.0,Alice,5,
