You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $100. How about $87.50?

While Alice is moving closer to a price I'd accept, going back and forth will likely lead to a price higher than John's offer of $80.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
