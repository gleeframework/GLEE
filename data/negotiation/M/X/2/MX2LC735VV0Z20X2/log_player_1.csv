Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the value of the product, $1,000,000 is beyond my current budget. To move forward, I'd be willing to offer $700,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $920,000.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $780,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and moving in the right direction. We're still closer to our desired price and have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  I'm willing to go to $820,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. This represents a compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is still negotiating, his offer increases are getting smaller. We're now at a point where continuing the negotiation with Bob has a lower expected value than John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut our losses and take the sure thing."
