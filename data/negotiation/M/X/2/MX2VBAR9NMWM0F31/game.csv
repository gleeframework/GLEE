"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in its benefits. I am offering it to you today for $140, which is a special discount considering its value. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To move forward, I propose we meet at $135 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on it. I hope this offer works for you.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested, Bob. I'll make one last offer to accommodate your budget. I propose selling the product for $130. This is slightly higher than your last offer, but it's still below the original price. I believe this is a reasonable compromise given the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $128 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",128.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your financial constraints and I'm willing to make a final offer. I propose selling the product for $129. This is a slight increase from your last offer, but it's still below the original price. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I hope this offer meets your expectations.",129.0,Alice,7,
