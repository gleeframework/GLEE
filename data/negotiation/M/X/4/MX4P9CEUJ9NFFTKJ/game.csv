"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations, I'm open to further negotiation. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $1,250,000.  This price acknowledges the product's value and allows for a win-win scenario for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also accommodating your financial limitations.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
