"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we settle on $2,000,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new counteroffer of $1,900,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
