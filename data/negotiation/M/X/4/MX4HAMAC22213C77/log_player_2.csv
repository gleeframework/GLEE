"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

The product is worth no more than $15,000 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $12,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $20,000, and it's still within Bob's budget. This counteroffer will give Alice an incentive to negotiate, but it's also a good starting point for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $17,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his desired price of $15,000. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue seeking a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price, but still wants to save more. A counteroffer of $14,000 is a good compromise, as it's only $1,000 less than Alice's last offer.  It also shows Bob is serious about negotiating and might be willing to pay slightly more than his initial target, but only if Alice is willing to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he is still willing to negotiate. With 5 rounds left, Bob can still try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where he is willing to pay a bit more than his initial target of $14,000, but still wants to save some money. A counteroffer of $14,500 shows that he is serious about buying the product but is not willing to pay Alice's full asking price. This counteroffer is a good compromise that might convince Alice to accept the deal."
