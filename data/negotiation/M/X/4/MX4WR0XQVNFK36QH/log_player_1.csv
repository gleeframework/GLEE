Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Fairness:** While I'm aiming high, I'm not being unreasonable.  $1,200,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to him.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message emphasizes that I'm open to discussion, inviting Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer.
* **John as a backup:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a safety net, knowing I can always sell to him for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he's still interested. This means there's room for further negotiation.  
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I still have John's offer of $1,000,000 as a backup, so I can afford to be firm in negotiations. 

I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still reflects the value the product brings, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:**  I've moved down from my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Still above John's offer:**  $1,100,000 is still higher than John's offer, ensuring I'm not losing out.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I've reiterated the value the product holds, hoping to persuade Bob.
* **Open to final agreement:**  I've made it clear I'm willing to reach a deal if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited room for further negotiation:**  We've already gone back and forth, and Bob's offers haven't moved significantly closer to my desired price.  
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price, and without further negotiation. 

I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John. The potential for a better deal with Bob is too risky at this point."
