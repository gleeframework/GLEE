# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe you'll love it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not ready to give up on the potential for a higher profit.
