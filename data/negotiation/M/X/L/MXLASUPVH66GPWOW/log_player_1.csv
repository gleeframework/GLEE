Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem less desperate to sell.
* **Anchoring:** By offering a price of $120, you're setting an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely the final price will be closer to $120 than it would be if you started at $85.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80, so you're not desperate. This allows you to be firmer in your negotiations with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects your initial price."
