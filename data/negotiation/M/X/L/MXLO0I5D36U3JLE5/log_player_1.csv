{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've started with a price of $120. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I've kept the message friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product.  

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and set a starting point for negotiation. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the product for less than my minimum value of $100. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $80. Would you be willing to come down to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I need to maintain a profit margin. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your budget, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $90? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've proposed $90, which is the midpoint between my minimum price ($100) and Bob's offer ($80).
* **Message:** I've maintained a positive tone, acknowledging Bob's budget but emphasizing the value of the product.  

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us. It's a reasonable price that still allows me to earn a profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
