"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product for $150. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $85 for this product, which seems like a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think this product is worth more than $85.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $125 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a fair price considering my limit and your desire to sell. Let's make a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $95, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that yet. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, and I'm willing to meet you at $110. It's the best I can do.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles.  I'm still sticking to my maximum of $95.  If you're willing to accept that, we can make a deal.  Otherwise, I'm going to go with John's offer.",95.0,Bob,6,
