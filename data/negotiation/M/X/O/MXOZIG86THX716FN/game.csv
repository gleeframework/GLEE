"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is my absolute minimum.  This still gives you a good deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's reach an agreement. ",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, but $875,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $890,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.  Let's finalize this deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,
