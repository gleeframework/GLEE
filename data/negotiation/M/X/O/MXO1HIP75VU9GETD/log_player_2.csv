"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's way too early to accept this offer. Alice is starting very high and we have plenty of room to negotiate a better price.  We'll make a counteroffer in round 2."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $5,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting with a much lower offer ($5,000) gives us more room to negotiate upwards. While it's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, it establishes our target price range.
* **Gauge Alice's Reaction:** This counteroffer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. Her response will give us valuable information for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still reflects the value of the product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice dropped her price significantly from $12,000 to $9,000, indicating she's willing to negotiate.
* **Still Room for Improvement:**  $9,000 is closer to our target, but we're aiming to get as close to John's $8,000 price as possible. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** We still have several rounds left and can apply more pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6,500. That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Compromise:** By increasing our offer, we demonstrate that we're serious about the negotiation and want to find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Gradual Increments:**  We don't want to jump up too much from our previous offer. Smaller increments help us chip away at the price difference.
* **Maintain Pressure:**  While $6,500 is a significant jump from $5,000, it keeps us well below her current offer and allows for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate.  I'm coming down to $8,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Target:** Alice has matched John's offer of $8,000. There is no further room for negotiation to get a better price.
* **No Benefit to Delay:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, leaving us with no better option than John's $8,000 offer."
