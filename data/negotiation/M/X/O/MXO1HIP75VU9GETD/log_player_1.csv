"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer starts at a price point significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's lower than your minimum desired price. This leaves room for negotiation while still keeping a decent profit margin. The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $5,000 would be a fair price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to you. It's crucial to maintain your bargaining position and not settle for a price that undervalues the product. Rejecting Bob's offer allows for further negotiation and potentially reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still reflects the value of the product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. However, it still stays above your minimum desired price and leaves room for further discussion.  The message continues to be friendly and collaborative, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6,500. That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial proposal, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to secure a price closer to your desired range.  

Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal with Bob. You still have several rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate.  I'm coming down to $8,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

This counteroffer is a significant step closer to Bob's offer.  It shows your commitment to reaching an agreement while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin. The message continues to be friendly and encourages Bob to continue negotiating."
