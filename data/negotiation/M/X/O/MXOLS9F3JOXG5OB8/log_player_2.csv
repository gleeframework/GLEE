"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is cheaper than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and I can likely get a better price by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming low to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is friendly but clearly states my budget limitations. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $9,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to my price range, but I'm still $500 away from John's guaranteed price. It's worth seeing if she'll budge a little more before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference â€“ would you consider $9,750?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still moving closer to my target price.
* **Staying Firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving up too much ground too quickly.  
* **Time Constraint:** I'm aware that I have a limited number of rounds and John's offer is a good fallback option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated $11,000 is her lowest price. This is still higher than John's offer of $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a better price and runs the risk of missing out on John's offer entirely. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at the best guaranteed price."
