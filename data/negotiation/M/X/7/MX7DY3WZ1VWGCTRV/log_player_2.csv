"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $115. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

You can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's meet in the middle.

You can still get the product from John for $100, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer yet.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to get a lower price."
