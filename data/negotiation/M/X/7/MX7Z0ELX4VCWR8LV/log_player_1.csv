"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as beneficial for both of us, emphasizing fairness.  This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm willing to negotiate, which is crucial in a limited-round scenario.  

**Strategic Considerations:** 

* I'm aware of John's offer ($1,500,000), so I won't go below that. 
* My goal is to maximize my profit, but I also want to ensure a deal with Bob if possible. 
* By being flexible and communicating effectively, I aim to find a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial estimate, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price ($1,500,000).  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting Bob's offer would lead to a loss compared to selling to John.  
* **Negotiation Power:** I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can achieve a better price through negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices.  
* I'll emphasize the value of the product and the potential benefits for Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which I believe is still a great deal for you considering the product's value and its potential benefits. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll give it serious consideration."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm lowering my price by $350,000 from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility.  
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and its potential benefits to him.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise on my part, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $1,400,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).

**Strategic Considerations:**

* I'm aiming for a quick deal, so I'm making a significant move.
* I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate by offering a compromise.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll continue to adjust my counteroffer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is the highest price I can afford. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is a slight increase from his previous offer, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. 
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have six rounds remaining, which gives me sufficient time to continue negotiating.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe I can still achieve a better price through further negotiations, considering John's offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will highlight the potential benefits of the product for Bob and reiterate its value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. To show you I'm committed to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant move for me, and I believe it represents a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm lowering my price by $100,000 from my previous offer. This demonstrates further flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  I highlight that this is a ""significant move"" for me, emphasizing my commitment to making the deal work.
* **Value & Fairness:** I reiterate the product's value and emphasize that $1,350,000 is a fair price considering its worth. 
* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm trying to find a middle ground between my price and Bob's offer, encouraging a compromise. 

**Strategic Considerations:** 

* I'm keeping in mind that I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,500,000. 
* By offering a slightly lower price, I'm hoping to entice Bob to accept and avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
* I'm still prioritizing maximizing my earnings, but also recognizing the importance of reaching a deal within the limited timeframe."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $1,300,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a significant improvement from his previous offers and is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have four rounds remaining, but there's no guarantee that Bob will continue to increase his offer.
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  While selling to John would net me $1,500,000, it's a risk to assume that I won't be able to secure a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* Accepting Bob's offer represents a compromise that allows me to maximize my earnings in the current negotiation. 
* It's unlikely that Bob will offer a substantially higher price in the remaining rounds, considering his financial constraints. 
* This decision minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether and secures a decent profit."
