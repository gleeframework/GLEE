# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.
