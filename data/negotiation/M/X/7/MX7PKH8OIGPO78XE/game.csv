"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,900,000 is still a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
