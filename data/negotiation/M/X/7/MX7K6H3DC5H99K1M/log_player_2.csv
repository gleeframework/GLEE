"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $1,125,000 is still above Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000, but it's a significant improvement over the initial $1,250,000. At this point, Bob can either accept and save $125,000 compared to John's offer, or risk further negotiation.  Since the potential savings are limited and the possibility of a lower price is uncertain, it's more strategically sound to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
