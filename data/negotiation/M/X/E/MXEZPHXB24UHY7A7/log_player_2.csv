{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still above your ideal price point of $10,000. It's worth attempting to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This signals that I'm serious about getting a good price, and I'm hoping to find a middle ground quickly.  If she rejects this, I can continue to adjust my counteroffers strategically."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my ideal price of $10,000.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still too high. I'll continue to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $11,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal $10,000. If she rejects this, I'll likely need to increase my offer again, but I'm still hopeful to reach an agreement within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping that she'll eventually come down to a price that's acceptable to me.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as there's still room for Alice to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $11,500. This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product but am still determined to negotiate a price closer to my ideal.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, hoping to find a middle ground and hopefully secure the deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of rounds, and Alice's offers are still too high for me. It's becoming increasingly unlikely that we'll reach an agreement within my budget. Buying from John is the best option now, as I'm guaranteed to get the product and I don't want to risk losing out on the opportunity completely."
