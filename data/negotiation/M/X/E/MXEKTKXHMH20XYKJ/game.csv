"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your operations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $600,000 is significantly below its value, I'm willing to move from my initial price. How about we meet halfway and consider a price of $1,450,000? This reflects a considerable reduction on my end and keeps us moving towards a fair deal.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,450,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, which I believe is a fair price.  Let me know if this works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. I can come down to $1,100,000.  This offer takes into account your feedback while acknowledging the inherent worth of what I'm offering.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a big stretch for me.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one?  I'd be willing to go up to $900,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product.",900000.0,Bob,6,
