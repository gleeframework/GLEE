Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a big stretch for me.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one?  I'd be willing to go up to $900,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, his increments are too small to justify continuing the negotiation. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that competes with John's guaranteed offer.  It makes more business sense to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
