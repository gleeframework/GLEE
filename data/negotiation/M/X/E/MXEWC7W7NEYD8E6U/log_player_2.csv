"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. Let's start with a price of $140. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our $120 limit.  We'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  The product looks great, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) than Alice's initial price ($140). This leaves room for negotiation and gives us a better chance of getting closer to our $120 target. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** While the offer is low, the message remains polite and acknowledges Alice's initial offer. We want to keep the negotiation collaborative.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will help us gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, how about $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to our acceptable price, but we can still try to negotiate a bit further.  We are only $5 away from our ideal price with John, so we have some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($125) and our previous counteroffer ($105).  It shows a willingness to compromise while still moving towards our target price.
* **Direct and Clear:** We're stating our desired price directly to avoid any confusion and keep the negotiation efficient.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  We want to ensure Alice sees us as being reasonable and wanting to reach a deal."
