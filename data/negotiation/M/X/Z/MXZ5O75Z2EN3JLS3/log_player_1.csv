"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll be happy with it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, knowing Bob values it the same. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, and hopefully, he'll accept the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value of $800,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground closer to my preferred price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's last offer. Hopefully, this shows flexibility and encourages him to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the market value and our previous discussions, how about $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round, hopefully finding a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price. Let's split the difference. How about $800,000? This is my final offer, as it's my minimum price. It's a fair price for a valuable product. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

I'm offering my minimum price, aiming to close the deal.  This also emphasizes the finality of the offer to motivate Bob to accept."
