"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $8000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $10000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9800. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into negotiating with you. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,
