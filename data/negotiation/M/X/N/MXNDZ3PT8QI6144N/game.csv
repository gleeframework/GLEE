"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and it's a fantastic return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $850,000?  This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $775,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $812,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement quickly. Let me know your thoughts.",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While $812,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to offer $790,000.  This keeps us moving towards a fair deal.",790000.0,Bob,6,
