"Alice, your offer is way too high for me. Given my budget, I can only offer $8,000 for the product. If you're willing to come down to that price, we have a deal.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what the product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $18,000? This would still be a great deal for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the counter offer. I'm seeing you're serious about this product.  To be honest, $15,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a very fair price considering the value it will bring you.",15000.0,Alice,5,
