"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  Since you're willing to pay up to $10,000, rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice will go lower is a smart move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

Starting with a counteroffer of $8,500 is a reasonable move. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within your budget, making it a plausible offer for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and it's likely that further negotiation will not yield a significantly lower price. Accepting the offer secures the product for a price within your budget, and there's a risk of further negotiation leading to a stalemate or Alice walking away from the deal."
