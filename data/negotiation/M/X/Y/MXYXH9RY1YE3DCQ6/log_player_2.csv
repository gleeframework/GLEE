{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $12,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $15,000. This is a terrible deal, and I'm not going to accept it. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm willing to buy from another seller for $12,000. Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to pay that much yet. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering my final price of $12,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, as I can buy the product from John for the same price. I'm hoping Alice will accept, but if not, I'll have to go with John."
