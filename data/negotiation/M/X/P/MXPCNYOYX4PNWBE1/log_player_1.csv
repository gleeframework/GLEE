Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while ensuring we don't leave money on the table. 
* **Justification:** Framing the price around ""potential"" and ""true worth"" emphasizes the value proposition, rather than just stating a number.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in discussion and counter-offer, signaling flexibility.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit while acknowledging we have a guaranteed sale with John. This approach aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:** A high price will reveal if he's truly motivated or simply testing the waters.
2. **Potentially secure a premium:** Bob might be willing to pay more than $1,500,000 if he perceives the value aligns with his needs.
3. **Leave room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial price, we can gradually lower it, using John's offer as a ""bottom line"" in our mind."
