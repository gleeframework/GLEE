"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob and John is selling it for the same price, Bob should buy from John.  There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer as it's the same price."
