"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,500 is below your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice, or if not, you can always fall back on John's offer."
