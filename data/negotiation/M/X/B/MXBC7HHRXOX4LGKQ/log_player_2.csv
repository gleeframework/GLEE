(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's budget and significantly higher than Bob's maximum willingness to pay. It's crucial to start negotiating from a lower point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and begin the negotiation process."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

Let's try to bridge the gap and reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end. While I'm motivated to find a solution that works for both of us, I also have other interested buyers. To be fair to everyone's time, I'm willing to drop to $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than reasonable given the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,750,000 is still quite a bit higher than what I can afford.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and reflects a price that is closer to the value I see in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Compromise:** Bob increases his offer, showing a willingness to move towards Alice's price, but still staying significantly below her current offer. This demonstrates his commitment to finding a solution.
* **Focus on Value:** Bob reminds Alice of his perception of the product's value, justifying his offer.
* **Finding a Solution:** By reiterating the need for a mutually beneficial solution, Bob maintains a positive and collaborative tone.

This strategy aims to:

* **Increase pressure on Alice:**  The offer is still lower than Alice's, pushing her to consider a further compromise.
* **Signal seriousness:**  The increase in Bob's offer shows that he's willing to negotiate further.
* **Keep the negotiations moving:**  A counteroffer maintains the momentum and keeps the conversation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your latest offer tells me you're serious, and I respect that. However, I need to be equally serious about the value of what I'm offering. Let's make this simple: $1,600,000, and we have a deal. This is a non-negotiable offer.  I need a decision from you on this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her offer is still more than what Bob is willing to pay. 
* **High risk of a deal falling through:** There are only 3 rounds left. If Bob accepts this offer, he might be left with a product that is still worth much more to Alice than to him. 
* **The pressure is on Alice:**  Alice has made it clear this is a non-negotiable offer. However, Bob can still reject it and make a counteroffer. He has nothing to lose at this point. This may pressure Alice to consider a lower price to avoid losing the deal completely.

**Strategy:** Bob should continue to negotiate by making a counteroffer in the next round. He may be able to secure a better price or at least get closer to his target price. If the negotiation fails, he can still purchase the product from Jhon for $800,000."
