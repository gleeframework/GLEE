"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as that's the highest I can go at this time. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting a good compromise for both of us. This price still leaves room for your desired profit, and it's closer to what I believe the product is worth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $875,000. It's a fair price considering it's closer to your desired selling point and leaves some room for profit for you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
