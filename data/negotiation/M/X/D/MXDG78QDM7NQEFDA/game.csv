"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its immense potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,250,000 is far too high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable starting point for our negotiation. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this. While I understand your perspective on the value, $1,200,000 falls significantly short of what I had in mind.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This price reflects the true worth of this product and its potential for your business.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value, but $1,950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. It's a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my interest in this product. Let's work towards a mutually acceptable price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I see we are getting closer.  Given the significant value this product offers, and to find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer considering the potential return on investment you'll gain.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,550,000 is still out of my reach. To demonstrate my strong interest, I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to explore other options.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
