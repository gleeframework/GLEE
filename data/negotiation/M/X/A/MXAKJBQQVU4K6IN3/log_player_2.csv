"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are better off rejecting Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $90
* **John's Offer:** $100
* **Your Maximum:** $100

You can get the product for $10 less from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or proceeding to buy from John."
