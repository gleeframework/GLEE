Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $9,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible. Starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($10,000) is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $9,500 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your desired profit.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a time limit creates urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly rather than overthink the offer.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject this offer. However, since you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you won't be losing out completely."
