"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $12000. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you.

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm confident the value of this product will exceed that price for you in the long run. To show my willingness to compromise, I'm offering you the product for $13500. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,5,
