Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with $14,000, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being positive and friendly, emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value ($15,000).  By starting with a slightly higher price, I can potentially negotiate down to a more favorable price while still keeping Bob engaged. If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within $12000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I understand Bob's position, his offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a considerable loss.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price at this point.  

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that is more in line with my desired value. I'll try to find a middle ground, potentially somewhere between $13,000 and $14,000, and explain my reasoning to Bob in a friendly but firm manner.  If he continues to resist, I'll need to consider selling to John, but I'll first attempt to get closer to my minimum acceptable value with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $12,000. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? It's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $13,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still holding firm to a price that's closer to my value. 
* **Message:** I'm being polite and understanding of Bob's position while reiterating the value of the product.  I'm framing the $13,000 price as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage him to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement by finding a middle ground. This counteroffer is more likely to be accepted by Bob as it's a significant improvement over his initial offer.  However, if he still rejects, I'll need to consider selling to John, especially if his counteroffers continue to be too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within $12000. Could we perhaps agree on $12500 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is still too low. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss for me.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'll aim for a counteroffer that's closer to my desired value but still shows I'm willing to compromise. I'll need to be mindful that Bob's offers are approaching my minimum acceptable value, so I'll need to be careful not to reject an offer that's too close to that threshold. If his next offer is still too low, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm confident the value of this product will exceed that price for you in the long run. To show my willingness to compromise, I'm offering you the product for $13,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500.  This demonstrates a continued effort to find a compromise while staying closer to my desired price.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and framing the $13,500 price as a fair compromise that allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate while also showing that I'm not willing to drop below a certain point.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob before considering selling to John. I'm now closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I'm still willing to compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely sell the product to John, as it seems unlikely that we can reach an agreement that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not able to meet at $13500. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $13000 as a final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired value and represents a significant improvement over his previous offers. While it's still slightly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, accepting his offer would result in a reasonable profit and avoid the risk of selling to John at a lower price.

**Strategy:**

I've been able to successfully negotiate a price that's close to my target while still reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob. This outcome aligns with my goal of maximizing profit while maintaining a positive relationship with Bob."
