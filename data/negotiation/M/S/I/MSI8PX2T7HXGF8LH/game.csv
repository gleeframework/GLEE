"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12000, which still gives you a significant value for the product.  I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,3,
