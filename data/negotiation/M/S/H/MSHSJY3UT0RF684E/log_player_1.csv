"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $135, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking Bob what he thinks. This shows I'm willing to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it's a starting point for further negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is the fallback:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This would be a great deal for you, and it's still a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise price that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob that $120 is a great deal for him, reinforcing the value of the product.
* **Maintaining my minimum:**  $120 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I'm not giving away the product for cheap."
