"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $10,200? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,
