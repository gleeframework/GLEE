"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for this product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the fact that I can purchase a similar product from John for $15000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,
