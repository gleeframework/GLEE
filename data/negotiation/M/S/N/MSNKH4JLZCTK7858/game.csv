"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I believe $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, but I still believe the product is worth less than $1,125,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,075,000.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle this right now? I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which I feel is more than fair. It's a win-win for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
