# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget ($1,500,000).**  Even though she claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, that's her perspective, not yours. 
* **You have a fallback option with John.** Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still within your budget. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate further with her or simply purchase from John."
