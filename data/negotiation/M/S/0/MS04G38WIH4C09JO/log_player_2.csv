# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $170. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $170 is far above your $80 limit. You can get the product for a much better price from John."
