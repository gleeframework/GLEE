Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $170. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can afford to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80).  
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $170 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While a lower price might guarantee a sale to Bob, aiming higher lets you potentially earn the maximum possible profit."
