Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but not so high as to immediately deter him.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price, but I'm also willing to walk away if necessary and sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to sell for less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $105. This is still above Bob's initial offer of $90, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and move closer to his price. I'm hoping this compromise will lead to a quick agreement, but I'm still ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
