Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  There's a potential profit margin between $800,000 and $1,200,000. Your goal is to capture as much of this as possible.

**Strategy**

You want to start high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a good deal. Aiming for a price too close to $1,200,000 risks an immediate rejection.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Why This Offer Makes Sense**

* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,050,000 is a strong opening, giving you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Highlights Value:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price.
* **Leaves Room for Bob:** Bob still sees a potential $150,000 gain ($1,200,000 - $1,050,000), making it more likely he'll accept or counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting John's offer of $800,000."
