# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,050,000, which is less than John's price of $1,200,000. 
* **You're still saving money:** While the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, you're getting it for $1,050,000, which is still within your budget of $1,200,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial option."
