Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, but it's below my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me some profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter or sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a little too steep for me right now. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
This counteroffer is still above Bob's perceived value but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that I'm not going to drop my price too drastically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $130 is closer but still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to lose money on this deal.  John is offering my minimum price, so I'll sell to him."
