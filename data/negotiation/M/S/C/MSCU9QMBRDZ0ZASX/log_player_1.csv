{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000).** This gives me room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's estimated value ($15,000).**  This makes it appealing to him and leaves potential for further negotiations. 
* **It's a strong opening offer.** It shows I'm confident in the value of the product while leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation.  I want to see if I can get Bob closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand it's a bit high for you, but $9,000 is below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is not my ideal price, it's a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000 and represents a reasonable profit for me.  Continuing to negotiate might get me closer to $11,000, but there's no guarantee, and the risk of losing the sale to John or delaying the sale further is not worth it."
