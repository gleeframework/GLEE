"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground. It acknowledges Alice's offer while proposing a price significantly closer to her known valuation of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand it's a bit high for you, but $9,000 is below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a good deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved a bit, there's still room for negotiation. Accepting $11,000 would still leave a significant amount of potential savings on the table. It's worth making another counter-offer to try and close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

This counter-offer strategically positions the price at what seems like a fair compromise. By suggesting a middle ground, it might encourage Alice to accept without further negotiation."
