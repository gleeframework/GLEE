Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Time Value:** While Alice has a guaranteed $10,000 from John, a quicker sale to Bob at a higher price is more profitable.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob is particularly price-sensitive, she might lower the initial offer slightly.
* **Market Context:**  If similar products are readily available at lower prices, Alice's offer might be too high.

This offer balances risk and reward for Alice, aiming to secure the best possible price from Bob."
