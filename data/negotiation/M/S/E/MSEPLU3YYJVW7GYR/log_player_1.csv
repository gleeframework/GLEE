""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm offering it to you first.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit with Bob:** Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, we want to aim for a price slightly below that to make it attractive while maximizing profit. 
* **Alternative Guarantee:** We have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 with John, so we don't want to go below that.
* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,350,000 gives us room to potentially negotiate lower if Bob counters, while still securing a significant profit above his valuation."
