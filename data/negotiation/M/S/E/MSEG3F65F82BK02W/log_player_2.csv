"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is $1,000,000 to you. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is tempting, you know you have John as a backup option to buy the product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her. Even if you don't manage to get her price down, you can always fall back on buying from John."
