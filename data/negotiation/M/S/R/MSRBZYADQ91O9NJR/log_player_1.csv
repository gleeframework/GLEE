Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $115 gives Bob some room to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal, while still giving me a decent profit.
* **Positive and Engaging:** The message is friendly and upbeat to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  By mentioning John, I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other options and won't be afraid to walk away if the deal isn't favorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  I've established a minimum price of $120 for myself. Selling to Bob for $100 would be below that, resulting in a loss.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** While Bob's offer is tempting, I can potentially still negotiate a higher price with him. I haven't exhausted all options yet.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. This strengthens my position in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to see the offer as a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and engaging to maintain a good rapport with Bob.
* **Firm but Fair:**  While I'm willing to lower my price, $110 is still above my minimum, ensuring I'm not losing money."
