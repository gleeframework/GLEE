"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a decent starting point, but it's still too high for Bob. He can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value for it is $800,000. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** Bob wants to secure a good deal, so his counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. However, it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price, suggesting a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** Bob emphasizes the potential for a win-win situation, framing his offer as beneficial for both parties.
* **Setting the stage:** This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation, allowing both parties to explore a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant savings:** Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant saving compared to Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Progress towards agreement:** Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, moving closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While this offer is good, Bob might still try to negotiate a slightly lower price in future rounds, but the risk of losing the deal to another seller is now higher.

**Conclusion:** 

At this point, it's a good idea for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that offers substantial savings."
