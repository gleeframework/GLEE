"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming closer to my price range.  While $900,000 is still a bit steep, I'd be willing to go up to $700,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me and the fact that we're both compromising. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.",850000.0,Alice,5,
