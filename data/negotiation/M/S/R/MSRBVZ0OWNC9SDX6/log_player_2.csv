# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming closer to my price range.  While $900,000 is still a bit steep, I'd be willing to go up to $700,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me and the fact that we're both compromising. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000 and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000 which meets your needs."
