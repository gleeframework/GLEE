Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

We're getting closer, but there's still room to negotiate. Alice is willing to come down in price, so we're on the right track."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her last offer, and we have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice."
