"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me, would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,500 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $11,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,500.  This is really my final offer,  let me know if you're interested.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to drop to $11,400.  This is really my final offer before I consider other options.  Let me know what you think.",11400.0,Alice,7,
