Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me, would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,500 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $11,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
