Round 3

```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $145 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only a few rounds left and Alice unwilling to go lower than $140, it's time to cut your losses and buy from John.  While you would ideally like to spend less, you're running out of time and Alice is not showing signs of budging further.  It's better to secure the product from John at $100 than to risk losing the opportunity altogether by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
