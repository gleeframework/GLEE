"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a deal on this incredible product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable, and I'm willing to make it a fair deal. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $950,000 is slightly under your $1,000,000 limit, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product is worth less to her ($800,000).  Rejecting her initial offer might lead to a better counter-offer closer to her desired profit margin."
