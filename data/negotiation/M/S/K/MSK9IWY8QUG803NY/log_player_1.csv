Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I could go to $750,000.  Do you think we could make that work?

You have three options:

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently making small increments and is highly unlikely to reach a price point that is acceptable.  It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
