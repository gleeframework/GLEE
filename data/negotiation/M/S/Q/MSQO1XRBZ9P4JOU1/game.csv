"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be a significant asset to you. I'm initially offering it for $2,000,000. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 to make it work on my end.  What do you say?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price reflects the value it would bring to your business while still being a fair deal for me.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product could be worth it at that price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a long way from what I'm looking for.  To make this work, I can go as low as $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
