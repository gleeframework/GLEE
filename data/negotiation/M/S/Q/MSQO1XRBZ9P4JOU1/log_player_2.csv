"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be a significant asset to you. I'm initially offering it for $2,000,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price reflects the value it would bring to your business while still being a fair deal for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a long way from what I'm looking for.  To make this work, I can go as low as $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

```

Reason: Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from $1,100,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid potentially overpaying."
