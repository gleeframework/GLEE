This initial offer is a starting point. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also provides a reason for the price and frames it positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you meet me halfway and consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for that.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before accepting or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our initial offers.  How about $1,250,000? This still leaves room for a good return for you, while ensuring I get a fair value for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's a tough decision, but selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price, which is the most important thing to me.  I'm not willing to risk losing out on this much value for the sake of potentially getting a slightly higher price from Bob."
