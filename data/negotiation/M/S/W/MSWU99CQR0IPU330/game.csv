"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you meet me halfway and consider my counteroffer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our initial offers.  How about $1250000? This still leaves room for a good return for you, while ensuring I get a fair value for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
