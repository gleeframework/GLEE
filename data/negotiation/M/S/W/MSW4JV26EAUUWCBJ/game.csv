"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $11,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, as a compromise. This would still be a great deal for you, given the value you place on the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $11,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
