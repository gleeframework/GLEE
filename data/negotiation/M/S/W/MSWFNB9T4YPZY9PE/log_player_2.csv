"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking $160 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate or go with John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $80 would be more reasonable."", ""product_price"": 80}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation.
* **Aiming for Savings:** Our goal is to get the product for well under $100, and this offer reflects that.
* **Leaving Room:**  This offer gives Alice space to counter and still potentially reach a price acceptable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met us in the middle, but her idea of ""middle"" is still her initial valuation.  We need to signal we're willing to walk away, or she has no incentive to drop further.  John's offer is starting to look very attractive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand that you value the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I can do $90, but that's really pushing it for me."", ""product_price"": 90}

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing Slightly:** We're increasing our offer to show willingness to negotiate, but not by much.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The message emphasizes our budget limitations, making it clear we're serious.
* **Approaching the Limit:** We're getting close to our walk-away point ($100 from John).  The next offer from Alice will likely determine if a deal is possible."
