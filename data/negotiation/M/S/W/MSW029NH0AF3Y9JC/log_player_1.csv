Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.
