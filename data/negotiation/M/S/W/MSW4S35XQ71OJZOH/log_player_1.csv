Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $145. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested. I'm willing to go down to $140, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're still interested."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $135. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150 than my previous offer of $140. It's also a good compromise considering he's been willing to negotiate.  Accepting his offer allows me to move forward with the sale and avoids further negotiations."
