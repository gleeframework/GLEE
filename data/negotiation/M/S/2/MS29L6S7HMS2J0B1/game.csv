"Alice, $20000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $8000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $12000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to sell the product without losing too much. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get the product without breaking the bank.  Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,5,
