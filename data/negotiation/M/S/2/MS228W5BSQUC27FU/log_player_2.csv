"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great opportunity to acquire something valuable, and I'm confident you won't find it elsewhere. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  You can get the same product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money."
