Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows you're willing to be flexible.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, it's below my minimum desired price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? That's still a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to do $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my ideal price, but it's close enough to my minimum and a better deal than selling to John. It's likely we won't get a better offer from Bob, so accepting seems like the most reasonable option."
