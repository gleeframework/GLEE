"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to me.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a good compromise that allows us both to reach a win-win agreement.  Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
