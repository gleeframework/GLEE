"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential benefit to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Strategic Price:** $12,000 is a good starting point, as it allows for potential concessions without significantly impacting my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price and below the product's value to Bob.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While I could sell to John for $15,000, I believe there's still room for a better price with Bob.  I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round.
* **Time to leverage my position:** By rejecting his offer, I show Bob I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away. This might make him consider a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still significantly above his initial offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the benefit to both of us, emphasizing a win-win scenario.
* **Strategic Price:** $9,000 is a good midpoint, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my minimum, $7,000 is still not a profitable deal for me. 
* **I want to push for a better price:**  I believe we can still reach a compromise closer to my target.
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have six rounds left, giving me time to negotiate further without risking selling to John at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a good compromise that allows us both to reach a win-win agreement.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final offer before considering selling to John.  I'm willing to meet Bob almost halfway at this point.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Strategic Price:**  $8,500 is a good balance between my minimum and Bob's offer, leaving little room for further negotiation."
