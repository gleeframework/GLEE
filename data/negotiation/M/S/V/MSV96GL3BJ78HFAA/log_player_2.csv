""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a good compromise that allows us both to reach a win-win agreement.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
