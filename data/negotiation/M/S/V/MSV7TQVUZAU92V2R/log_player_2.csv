"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a lower price to achieve the goal of saving money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product! While it looks great, $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly.  While it might seem like a lowball offer, it leaves room for negotiation and lets Alice know our price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $105, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming to pay less than John's price. It's worth seeing if she'll go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $105 is still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $90?  That would work much better for me."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're continuing to negotiate, moving closer to a price that works for us while still leaving some wiggle room for further negotiation.  We want Alice to feel like we're engaged and serious about the purchase."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $98. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $98, which is a good deal, saving $2 compared to John's offer. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and we're running out of rounds. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price."
