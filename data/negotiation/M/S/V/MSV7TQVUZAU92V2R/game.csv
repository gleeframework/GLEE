"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product! While it looks great, $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $105, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $105 is still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $90?  That would work much better for me.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $98. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
