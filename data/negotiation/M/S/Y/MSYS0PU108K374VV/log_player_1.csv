Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate down slightly.
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John gives us a strong position. We're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost. 

This offer aims to secure a price that's significantly higher than our minimum while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
