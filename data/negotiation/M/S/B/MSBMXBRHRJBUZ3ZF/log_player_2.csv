"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is $150. It's more beneficial to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. Offering $100 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $150. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it signals Bob's serious interest while still leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now exactly what the product is worth to Bob. While he could continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price, there's no guarantee of success. There are also only 7 rounds left, and there's a risk of reaching the end of the negotiations without a deal. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at his maximum value, minimizing risk and maximizing efficiency."
