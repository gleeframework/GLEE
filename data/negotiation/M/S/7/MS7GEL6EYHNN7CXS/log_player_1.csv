Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** $140 is comfortably above your $120 minimum, ensuring a good profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup at $120 gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob."
