"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it could be a good fit, $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm thinking closer to $6,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This offer reflects the true value of this product.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $9,500? That's a significant compromise from my original price and reflects a fair deal for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,500 is closer, but still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? ",8250.0,Bob,6,
