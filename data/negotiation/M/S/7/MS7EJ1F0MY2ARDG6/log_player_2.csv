"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and unique features, it's valued at $120 by me. Considering its worth to you might be around $80, I propose we find a fair compromise. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $100? This way, both parties can feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $100 is still higher than your maximum budget of $80. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply proceed with buying from John."
