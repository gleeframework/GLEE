"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,500. I'm confident this product is worth that much to me."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,250 is a good compromise.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still leaves some room for profit for Alice.  It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more back and forth, potentially wasting time and risking Alice walking away from the deal.  Accepting her offer is the most sensible move for Bob."
