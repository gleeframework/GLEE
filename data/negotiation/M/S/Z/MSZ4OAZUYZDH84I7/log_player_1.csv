"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,300,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. How about we try $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly above John's offer. It's worth pushing a little further to see if Bob will budge closer to $1,300,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is close, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this work. Would you consider $1,275,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1275000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. How about we try $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point. Accepting $1,225,000 is a reasonable compromise, netting a good profit over John's offer and avoiding the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
