"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable.  However, $10,250 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,400 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're serious about buying it, I suggest we close the deal at this price.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,400 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,300, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price?",10300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm feeling we're getting very close here.  To show my willingness to come to an agreement, I'll offer you the product for $10,350. This is a price that's fair to both of us. Let's close this deal now, and we can both move on.",10350.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,350. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,275. Can you consider that?",10275.0,Bob,8,
