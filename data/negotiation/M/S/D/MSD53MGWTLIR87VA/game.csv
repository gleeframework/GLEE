,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $105? I think that's fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $115.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still leaves you with a decent profit.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $132.50 and $115, which is $123.75. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",123.75,Alice,5,
