Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for compromise:** $12,000 is a good starting point as it allows for both of us to potentially find a middle ground. 
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can always go back to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer, but still significantly higher than his initial proposal. 
* **Clear Communication:** I'm explicitly stating my reasoning for the counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate and reach a compromise. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** While $10,500 is a lower price than my ideal, it's still above my minimum acceptable value, keeping me in a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,250. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate, especially as Bob seems firm on his price.
* **Time is money:**  Accepting this offer allows me to quickly close the deal and move on.  

While I would prefer to get closer to $15,000, accepting this offer is a good compromise, considering that I can sell to John at any time."
