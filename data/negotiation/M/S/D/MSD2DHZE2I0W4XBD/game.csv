"I'm excited to offer you this great product for a one-time price of $9,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7,000.  Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. This is a great price for a product that's worth $10,000 to you, and I think you'll find it's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $8,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. How about we meet at $8,000? This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for a product that's worth $10,000 to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
