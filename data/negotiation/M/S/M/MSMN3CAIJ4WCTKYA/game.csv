"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is the best price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
