"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. While $750,000 is still below my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $800,000? I think that's the best we can both get out of this deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
