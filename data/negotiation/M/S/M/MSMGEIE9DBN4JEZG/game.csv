,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $18,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? I'm confident this product will bring you significant value.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18,000 and $20,000. How about we try $19,000? I think this is a fair compromise.",19000.0,Bob,4,
