"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, Thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be significant to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $500000 to see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, but $500000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget and the current market conditions, I am unable to agree to $1250000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750000. I hope this brings us closer to finding a solution that suits both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product and appreciate your efforts to find common ground, I am still unable to meet the price of $1000000. I would like to propose one last counteroffer of $900000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching a satisfactory agreement.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get at least $1200000 for the product. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
