"Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I've done some research and I'm not sure if the product is worth the full $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,500?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $9,500. However, I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $11,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500, as I mentioned earlier. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $10,800. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $10,800 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $9,000, which would be $9,900. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",9900.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,10,
