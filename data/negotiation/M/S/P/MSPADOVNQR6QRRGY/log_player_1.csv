Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
