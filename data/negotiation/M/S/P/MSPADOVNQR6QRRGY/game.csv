"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to reduce the price to $875000, which is still a great value for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
