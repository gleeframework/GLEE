Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I make a profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further.  However, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $150, so I won't accept any offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $160 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer and see how Bob responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $170. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I'm hoping that this will be attractive enough to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $165. While I was hoping to get closer to my initial price of $180,  $165 is a good compromise and a significant profit over selling to John.  It's also likely that further negotiation would only prolong the process and potentially result in a lower offer."
