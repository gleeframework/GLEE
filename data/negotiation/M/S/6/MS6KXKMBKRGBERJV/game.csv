"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $7500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $8250. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8250 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  I'm happy to offer $8000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that's beneficial for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is a fair price for you, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $250. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $8100. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8100.0,Alice,5,
