"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there.  $9,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?  That would be a good deal for both of us, I think.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm open to one final compromise. Let's try $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
