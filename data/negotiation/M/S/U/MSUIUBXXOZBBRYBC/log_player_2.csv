"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Buying from Alice for $950,000 saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though you could potentially get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating with her further, you're guaranteed to save money by accepting her offer.  There's no guarantee you'll be able to get a better price from Alice, and you risk ending up paying John's higher price."
