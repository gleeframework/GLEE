"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my position. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, but unfortunately, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer at $1,750,000. This amount reflects a compromise between the product's value and my financial capabilities.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,825,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us considering the product's value.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
