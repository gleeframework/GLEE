Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, knowing we have a fallback offer of $800,000 from John.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $925,000 creates a significant profit margin while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($75,000 less than his valuation).
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a psychological element, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
 
This approach balances risk and reward, aiming for a high sale price while acknowledging that pushing too close to $1,000,000 might make Bob balk and go with a competitor."
