"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 was a bit high for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm not willing to go lower than that. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $775,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a decent profit. How about we meet at $825,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,,
