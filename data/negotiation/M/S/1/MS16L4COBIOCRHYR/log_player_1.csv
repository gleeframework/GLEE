Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $140."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Ensure a Sale:** Offering it too high (close to $150) risks Bob rejecting it, leaving you with the $120 offer from John.

This strategy balances risk and potential reward, aiming for the best possible outcome."
