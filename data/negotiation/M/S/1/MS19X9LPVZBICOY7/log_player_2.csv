"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, and you have multiple rounds to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, which is a positive sign. However, $875,000 is still above my target of $800,000. There is still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to push for a lower price.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $860,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still above my comfort zone. I believe there's still room for negotiation and am confident I can secure a better deal. It's worth pushing for a lower price as I still have multiple rounds left."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $870,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to offer $865,000. This is a fair price considering we're both getting closer to a compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 865000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my target price of $800,000. With only 3 rounds remaining, the odds of securing a deal at my ideal price are getting slim. It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to budge much further. To avoid risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on the deal altogether, I'll buy from John, who is offering the product at my target price."
