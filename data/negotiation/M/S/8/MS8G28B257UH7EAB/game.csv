"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",950000.0,Bob,4,
