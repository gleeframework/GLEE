"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,800 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,900.  This is a good price for both of us, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?",12900.0,Alice,5,
