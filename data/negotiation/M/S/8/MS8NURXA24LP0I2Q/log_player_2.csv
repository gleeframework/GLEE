"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You can definitely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That price is a bit high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $9,000 range.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening. This gives us room to negotiate while staying well below my $8,000 walk-away point (considering I could buy it from John for that price)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $16,000 is still too high.  It's important to show her I'm serious about a lower price. I'll counter with a price closer to my target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving on the price, Alice. To be honest, $16,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Could you consider something closer to $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming to stay well below her current offer.  This keeps the negotiation moving while pushing for a price closer to my ideal range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $14,000. This is my lowest price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice says this is her lowest price, but it's still early in the negotiation. I'll reject this offer to see if I can push her a little further. I'm getting closer to my walk-away point, though."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand this is important to you, Alice, and I respect that you have a bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

This counteroffer acknowledges Alice's position while still aiming for a significant discount. I'm getting close to my limit, but there's still some room to negotiate before I consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to my bottom line, but I'm not quite there yet. I can offer you the product for $13,500. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is a tough one. Alice is firmly set at $13,500, and while it's a much better price than her initial offer, it's still a significant amount more than John's $8,000.  

However, I'll try one last time to see if there's any wiggle room left. I'm willing to go slightly above John's price to avoid starting over with a new seller if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? That's the absolute best I can do."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

This is a strong final offer. It's a significant jump from my previous offer, showing Alice I'm serious about closing the deal. However, it's still below her last price, leaving some room for her to potentially accept.  If she rejects this, I'll likely buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've given you a lot of wiggle room, Bob, and I'm starting to think you're not serious about making a deal. I'm willing to make one last offer: $13,000. This is my absolute final price, and if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to walk away. Alice is unwilling to move significantly from her $13,000 price. While it's tempting to try one more time, I'm not confident she'll go much lower. Buying from John at $8,000 is a much better deal at this point, even though it means missing out on a slightly lower price from Alice."
