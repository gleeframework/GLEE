"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That price is a bit high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $9,000 range.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving on the price, Alice. To be honest, $16,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Could you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $14,000. This is my lowest price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand this is important to you, Alice, and I respect that you have a bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm close to my bottom line, but I'm not quite there yet. I can offer you the product for $13,500. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? That's the absolute best I can do.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've given you a lot of wiggle room, Bob, and I'm starting to think you're not serious about making a deal. I'm willing to make one last offer: $13,000. This is my absolute final price, and if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to explore other options.",13000.0,Alice,9,
