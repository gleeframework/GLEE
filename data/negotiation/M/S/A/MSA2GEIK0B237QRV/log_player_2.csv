Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $13500, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a free maintenance service. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for the product.
