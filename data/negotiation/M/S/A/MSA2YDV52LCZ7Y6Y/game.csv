"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see if I can do a bit better, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8250.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8,375? This way, I can still make a profit, and you'll get the product at a great price.",8375.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to go up to $8,200. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'd like to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a free setup service. In exchange, I'd like to sell the product to you for $8,300.",8300.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. I'll keep the warranty and setup service, but I'll meet you at $8,250. However, I'll throw in an additional 10% discount on the total price. That brings the price down to $7,325. Is this a deal you'd be willing to accept?",7325.0,Alice,9,
