{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is above my minimum value of $10,000 and leaves room for negotiation if Bob decides to counteroffer.  It also highlights the value to Bob, potentially making him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price more around $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I can likely get closer to my ideal price of $13,000. I will reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12,000? This price still reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is only $500 below my ideal price of $12,000.  Considering the risk of further negotiation and the potential to sell to John for only $10,000, it's in my best interest to accept this offer."
