Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value, and what John will pay)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Potential Profit:** $500,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,500,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  It's about finding a balance between a price attractive to Bob and profitable for you.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It emphasizes the product's exclusivity and value, subtly framing it as something desirable and worth negotiating for.
* **The Price: ** $1,350,000  This price leaves you with a significant profit margin ($350,000 above your minimum) while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a clear understanding of your walk-away point ($1,000,000) is crucial.
* **Relationship:**  While maximizing profit is important, consider if a long-term relationship with Bob is valuable.  A slightly lower price now could lead to future business opportunities."
