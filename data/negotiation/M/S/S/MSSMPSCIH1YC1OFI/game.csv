"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little more than what I was hoping for. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. Would you be willing to consider that price?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $109.  I think that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, but I still want to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,6,
