"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of immense value to you. While I can't disclose all the details just yet, I can assure you that it's worth no less than $1000000 to me. I'm confident that its value to you could be even greater.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, but I understand if it's not the right fit for you at this time.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
