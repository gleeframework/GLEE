"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a higher price.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
