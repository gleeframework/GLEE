"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering it's a good deal for you as well.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $9,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,250 is closer to what I had in mind but still a touch high. Would you consider $9,500?  I think that's a very fair offer and allows us both to benefit.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,7,
