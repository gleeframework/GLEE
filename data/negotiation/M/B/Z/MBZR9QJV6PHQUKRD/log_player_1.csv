"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still staying within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $850,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make at least $950,000 on this. If you're serious about purchasing the product, this is my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product for me and allows you a reasonable profit. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $900,000 is close to my minimum acceptable amount. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of a further negotiation breakdown."
