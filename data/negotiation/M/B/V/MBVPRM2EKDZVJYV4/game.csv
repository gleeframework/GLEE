"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is unfortunately far too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $8,000.  That's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
