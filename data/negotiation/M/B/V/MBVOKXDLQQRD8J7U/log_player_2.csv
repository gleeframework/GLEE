Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit away from your target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I can offer it to you for $13,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've made some concessions already, and I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $13,000.  Since you can get the product for $12,000 from John, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal and save the extra $1,000."
