"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $11,500? That would work much better for me.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit away from your target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I can offer it to you for $13,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I've made some concessions already, and I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",13000.0,Alice,7,
