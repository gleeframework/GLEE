"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me while still offering you a good return.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $825,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a certain price, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $780,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's work towards an agreement.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $780,000 is closer to what I need, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? That way, we both get a good deal and move forward. ",800000.0,Alice,5,
