"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $110, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
