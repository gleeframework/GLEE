Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your product but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffers and your understanding of the value this product brings.  To be frank, $8,750 is cutting it pretty close to my bottom line. I'd be willing to accept $8,900, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $8,900 is a good deal for you.  It's lower than your maximum price of $10,000 and you've already been negotiating for a while.  It's worth accepting to avoid further haggling and ensure you get the product."
