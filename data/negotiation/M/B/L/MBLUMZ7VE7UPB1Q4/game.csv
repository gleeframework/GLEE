"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is worth a great deal to you. I understand its value to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. Let's talk about $950,000. This allows you to get a great deal, and ensures I receive a good return on my investment. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,1,
