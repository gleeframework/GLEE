"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  This feels like a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I would like to counteroffer at $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a decent offer, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, showing flexibility while still aiming to get a good price. I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer."
