Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it would be a great deal for you!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Above Bob's Value:** Offering it at $100 or less means you lose potential profit.
* **Below Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $120 from John, so going below that makes no sense.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price still more profitable than $120."
