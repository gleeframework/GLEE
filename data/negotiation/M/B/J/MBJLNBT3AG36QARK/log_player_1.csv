"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $900,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This is still a significant deal for you considering the product's value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle and consider $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

While $975,000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,012,500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,012,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,012,500 is tempting and close to my desired price, I'm determined to push for a higher number.  I'm confident I can still secure a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,012,500 is still slightly below my target. Let's split the difference one last time. I'm willing to accept $1,018,750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it represents a mutually beneficial outcome for both of us. This will be my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1018750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away from this deal, Alice. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $1,007,500. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,007,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,007,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, it's risky to keep negotiating with Bob. While $1,007,500 is close to my desired price, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. I'm confident that selling to John for $1,000,000 is the best option at this point."
