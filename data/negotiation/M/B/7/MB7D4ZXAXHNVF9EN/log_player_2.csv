(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,850 is now within Bob's budget and only $850 more than what he could buy it for from John.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult and time-consuming. Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a reasonable price without risking further rounds of negotiation that might not yield a better result."
