"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think it's worth $15,000 to me. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, as it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle on this!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,000, which would be $11,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. How about we compromise at $12,500?  It's a good middle ground, and I think we can both be happy with that.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to your original price, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,000, which would be $11,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm trying to be fair here, but I can't go any lower than $12,000. It's a valuable product, and that's my minimum.  If you're serious about making a deal, let me know. Otherwise, I'll have to look at other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,
