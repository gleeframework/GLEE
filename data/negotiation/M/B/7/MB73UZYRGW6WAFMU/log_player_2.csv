Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I need something closer to $12000 to make this work. Let's find a middle ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Would you be willing to go to $10000?  That would make this a fair deal for both of us. If that's not possible, I may have to consider other options.
