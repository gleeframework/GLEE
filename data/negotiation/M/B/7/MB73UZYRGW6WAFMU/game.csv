"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering its potential benefits. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I need something closer to $12000 to make this work. Let's find a middle ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $9500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Would you be willing to go to $10000?  That would make this a fair deal for both of us. If that's not possible, I may have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,5,
