{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its potential benefits. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This leaves some room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive way, highlighting the product's value and suggesting a ""fair"" price to encourage Bob to consider it.

This is a strategic starting point.  I'm keeping the option open to sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my expectations, but also  allowing myself to potentially negotiate upwards if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's good to know he's interested, I can't accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I need something closer to $12,000 to make this work. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with a price of $12,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility but still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while expressing that it's too low. I'm using positive language to encourage further negotiation. I also emphasize the need for a ""middle ground"" to create a sense of collaboration.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive while pushing Bob towards a more acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $9500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While it's getting closer, I'm hesitant to accept it because it leaves me with very little profit.  I'll counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach a compromise, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Would you be willing to go to $10,000?  That would make this a fair deal for both of us. If that's not possible, I may have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering my absolute minimum price of $10,000. This demonstrates my firmness while still showing a willingness to reach a deal.
* **Message:**  I'm thanking Bob for his efforts and using a  tone that's firm but not aggressive. I'm emphasizing that $10,000 would be a fair deal for both of us, implying that I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 

This counteroffer is a final attempt to get Bob to my minimum price. If he rejects it, I'll move on to selling to John."
