"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too far off to make it seem unreasonable. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is a significant drop from my asking price, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm countering with a price slightly above my minimum value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not giving away the product for a bargain. This is a compromise that might appeal to Bob, especially after his previous offer was rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum value of $10,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and prevents me from potentially losing out by continuing to negotiate."
