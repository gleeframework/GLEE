"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offer. Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer gives us room to negotiate upward.
* **Polite and Open:**  The tone remains friendly and expresses interest, encouraging further negotiation. 
* **Target Price in Mind:** Our goal is to pay significantly less than $80 (John's price).  This counteroffer aims to get us closer to that target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John's Price:** Alice's counteroffer of $85 is still higher than John's price of $80. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** We've got time and Alice seems willing to negotiate. It's worth seeing if we can get her price closer to $80 or lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. It seems we both have some room to move here. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, but in smaller increments to show we're negotiating seriously.
* **Seeking a Middle Ground:**  A price of $75 is halfway between our last offer and Alice's counteroffer, suggesting a spirit of compromise.
* **Below John's Price:**  Crucially, we're still aiming for a price lower than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think $75 is a good starting point.  Let's meet in the middle at $80. This gives us both a fair deal and allows me to avoid selling to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches John's Price:** Alice has come down to $80, which is the same price we can get from John.
* **No Guarantee of a Lower Price:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get us a lower price from Alice, and we risk her withdrawing from the deal.
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now saves us time and potential hassle."
