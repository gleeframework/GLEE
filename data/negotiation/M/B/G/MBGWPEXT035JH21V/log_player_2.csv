"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value and your interest, I propose we make this transaction special. How about we agree on a price of $100? This not only secures a great deal for you but also ensures a reasonable profit for me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $100 is less than your maximum price of $120.
* **It's a better deal than John's:** You'll save $20 by accepting Alice's offer. 

While you could potentially try to negotiate with Alice further, accepting her offer is the most logical and financially beneficial choice."
