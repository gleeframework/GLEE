"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1,050,000.  This still represents a good deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",950000.0,Bob,4,
