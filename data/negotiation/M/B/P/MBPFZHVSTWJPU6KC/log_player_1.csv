{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating he's willing to pay more.  We're still significantly above John's offer, so it's worth continuing the negotiation to aim for a price closer to $900,000."

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has dropped back down to his previous offer of $850,000. This might indicate that this is his upper limit. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further or the negotiation stalling, while still securing a price well above John's offer."
