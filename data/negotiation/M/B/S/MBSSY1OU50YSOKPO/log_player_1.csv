Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $170. I think you'll find it's a great deal for what it offers."", ""product_price"": 170} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he gets you to come down in price.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial high price will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he flat-out rejects it, you know he's price-sensitive. If he counters, you can start to gauge his price range. 
* **John as Backup:** Remember, you have John as a reliable backup buyer at $120. This gives you leverage to walk away from a deal with Bob if it's not advantageous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $120 for the product, which is its actual value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering your absolute minimum acceptable price. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll go higher. You risk him walking away entirely. Since John offers the same amount with no hassle, it makes the most sense to sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
