"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is offering $130, which is much more than Bob wants to pay.  Bob should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While $107.50 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his $80 maximum. It's worth attempting another counteroffer to try and get even closer to his target."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair compromise. It's a great deal for you and allows me to get a decent price for the product. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $100 is closer to his target than previous offers, it's still above his maximum of $80. It's worth attempting one more counteroffer to try and push Alice closer to his price."

This would be a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for the product and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
