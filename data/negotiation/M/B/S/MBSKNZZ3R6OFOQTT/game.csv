"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1800000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $1400000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of $1600000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable price would be $1300000. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far away from the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to be confident that we're meeting at a price that reflects the product's worth. I'm thinking of $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go up to $1500000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1200000, and I think that's a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiations, and I appreciate your seriousness about the offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1400000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of meeting you at $1350000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not willing to go up to $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000, which would be $1275000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,10,
