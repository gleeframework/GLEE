"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get a great deal on a high-value item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I'm interested, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $12,500 for the product?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $10,500 - that would be a good compromise and allow us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I've already come down significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  If you're willing to come down to $10,750, I'd be happy to close the deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,800, but I need to make a profit. It's a fair compromise, and I think we can make this work.",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further, but $10,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,700. This way, we both get a good deal. How about it?",10700.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to give up yet, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,650, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. It's a good price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10650.0,Alice,9,
