"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $105 is a great price, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm willing to consider $108, which is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original price. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108

Alice's offer of $108 is still within your budget of $120, and it's closer to your desired price of $105. It's a good deal for you, so you should accept it."
