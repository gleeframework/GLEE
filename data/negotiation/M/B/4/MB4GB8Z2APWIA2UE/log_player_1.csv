"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my minimum desired value. I'll reject the offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. This is the maximum I can afford, but I'm really interested in making a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is now very close to my minimum desired value.  It's a good compromise and a decent deal for me.  I'll accept the offer and avoid the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
