,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still above my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $88. This would be a good deal for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try $90. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
