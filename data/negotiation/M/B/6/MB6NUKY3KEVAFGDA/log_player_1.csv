"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140.  This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable markup from my minimum value of $120 and gives Bob some room to negotiate. I'm confident that if he rejects this offer, I can still get a good price from him or sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is below my minimum value of $120.  I will reject this offer and proceed to the next round. I will send a counteroffer that is closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's low offer. This gives Bob a chance to meet me halfway while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $115 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John as I feel I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125. This is my final offer, and it's only slightly above my minimum. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum value. While I would ideally get a bit more, I'm willing to accept this offer. There are only a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by holding out for a higher price."
