Alice's offer of $885,000 is within your budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate further, with only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement increases.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids potential delays or the need to purchase from John at a higher cost."
