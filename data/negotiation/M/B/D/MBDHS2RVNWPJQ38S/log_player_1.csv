Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,200,000 at this stage. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. This would still represent a significant investment for me, but it's a more comfortable starting point for our negotiations. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
