"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go all the way to $950,000. I can do $1,050,000, which is my final offer. I think this is a great price for both of us, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
