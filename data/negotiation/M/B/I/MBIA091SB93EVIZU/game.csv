"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is reasonable, the product's value warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
