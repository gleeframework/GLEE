Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $11,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
