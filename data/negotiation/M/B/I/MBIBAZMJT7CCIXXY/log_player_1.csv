{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a good balance between maximizing my potential profit and giving Bob a reasonable price.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value and negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to $10,500. This still represents a significant savings for you compared to the product's value to you.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $10,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $12,000, Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and it shows that Bob is willing to negotiate.  It's time to finalize the deal and move forward."
