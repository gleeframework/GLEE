Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is a starting point, and it's higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation. I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed backup offer from John, which gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to take the $1,000,000, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'll attempt to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's low offer. It's a price that I feel is fair, considering the value of the product to me and my backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further delays and the possibility of not reaching a satisfactory price makes selling to John the best choice at this point. John's offer is secure and meets my minimum requirements, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant amount of money."
