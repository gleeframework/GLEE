Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth a lot to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit above the product's worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a good price:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation down to a profitable point.
* **Encourage Bob's engagement:** Showing confidence in the product's value might incentivize Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Maintain the John option:**  The knowledge of the alternative buyer puts you in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $900,000, selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000.  It's worth pushing for a better price with Bob, as I might be able to secure a higher amount than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, considering your eagerness. Let's meet halfway and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates a willingness to compromise, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Meet halfway:** Offering a price closer to Bob's proposal might increase the chances of a successful deal.
* **Maintain leverage:**  The offer is still above the $1,000,000 John is willing to pay, ensuring a profit even if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $925,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is still below the $1,000,000 that John is offering.  It seems Bob is unlikely to go higher, and further negotiation is unlikely to get me a better price. To guarantee a minimum of $1,000,000, I will sell the product to John."
