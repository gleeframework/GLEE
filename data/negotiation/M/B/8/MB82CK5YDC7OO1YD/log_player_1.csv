Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point - it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It also reflects the fact that I know the product is worth more to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum value of $80, and I believe it's unlikely that we'll get a better offer in the next round. It's best to accept and avoid risking a longer negotiation that might lead to me selling to John for a lower price."
