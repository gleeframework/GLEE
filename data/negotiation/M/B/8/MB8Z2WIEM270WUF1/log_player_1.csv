{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $140 is higher than your minimum of $120, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $140 is lower than Bob's value of $150, so he has room to potentially negotiate and still get a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** By starting at $140, you have room to lower the price slightly if necessary to secure the deal without going below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that's a little steep for me. Could you do it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $125. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than selling to John for the same amount.  It's time to close the deal."
