{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum but still leaves room for potential bargaining. It's important to be confident in your product's value while also being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is at your minimum, so it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe the product's value justifies a slightly higher price.  Would you be willing to pay $17,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $17500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum and likely the best you can get from him.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to him or having to sell to John for $15,000."
