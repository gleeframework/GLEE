"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price reflects the value it brings while leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle on $950,000? I feel like that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay a significant sum. We still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $950,000 is close, but to be frank, I need to see a number closer to $1,000,000 for this to make sense on my end.  How about $985,000? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 985000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Firmness:** By stating this is our final offer, we introduce a sense of urgency and seriousness to the negotiation.
* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller concession ($45,000) than previous rounds, signaling we're getting closer to our bottom line. 
* **Justification:** Briefly explaining our reasoning (""need to see a number closer to $1,000,000"") adds weight to our position without revealing too much.

This approach aims to secure a deal above $950,000 while still leaving Bob room to accept a price he finds reasonable."
