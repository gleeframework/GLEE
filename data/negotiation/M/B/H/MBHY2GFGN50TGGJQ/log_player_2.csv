# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price reflects the value it brings while leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $950,000 is close, but to be frank, I need to see a number closer to $1,000,000 for this to make sense on my end.  How about $985,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You'll be buying the product for $215,000 less than John's price.
* **Strong Position:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, suggesting she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. You risk Alice sticking to her price or the negotiation breaking down, forcing you to buy from John at a higher cost."
