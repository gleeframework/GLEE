"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price reflects the value it brings while leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle on $950,000? I feel like that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $950,000 is close, but to be frank, I need to see a number closer to $1,000,000 for this to make sense on my end.  How about $985,000? That's my final offer.",985000.0,Alice,5,
