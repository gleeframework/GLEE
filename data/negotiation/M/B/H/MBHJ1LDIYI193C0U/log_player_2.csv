"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something you've expressed interest in before, and I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $16,500 is higher than your maximum valuation of $15,000.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $15,000. 

It makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
