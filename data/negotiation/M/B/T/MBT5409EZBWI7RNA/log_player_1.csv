"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better price from him. I have 9 rounds left and I can always sell to John for the same amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $1,500,000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your minimum is $1200000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1350000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's a good compromise, and I've already gotten a better price than I was willing to accept initially. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on the sale."
