Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in your product's value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""listing it publicly"" and ""its value,""  Alice subtly implies the product might be desirable to others and justifies the higher price. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, great! If he negotiates, Alice has room to go down while still staying above her minimum. 

**Important Note:** Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects this initial offer, she should be ready to counter with a slightly lower price, still aiming to stay above her $8,000 minimum."
