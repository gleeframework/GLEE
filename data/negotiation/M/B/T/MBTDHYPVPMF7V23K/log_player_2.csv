"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I am unable to accept $9,000. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. How about we set the price at $10,250 for the product? This is slightly above your last offer and below my previous counteroffer. It reflects the value of the product while remaining within your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield significant savings. She's consistently coming down in price, but it's clear she's aiming for a price above $10,000.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000, it's more efficient to take that deal and avoid potentially lengthy negotiations."
