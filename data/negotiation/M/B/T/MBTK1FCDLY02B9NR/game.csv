"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness and value of the item, my budget is quite limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking to receive for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize getting a better price for the product. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my current budget constraints, I am unable to meet your latest offer. I would like to continue our discussion and propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this proposal will be more in line with what you're considering.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to continue the conversation. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $990000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",990000.0,Alice,5,
