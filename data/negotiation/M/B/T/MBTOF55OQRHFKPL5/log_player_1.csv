{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'll counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $112. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not willing to pay $112. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I've already made several concessions and don't want to risk losing out on a more profitable sale. John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'll go ahead and sell to him."
