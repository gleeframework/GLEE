"Alice,  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save more.  I'm happy to pay $10,000 for the product, considering its value to me and your own cost.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to save more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
