Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward, if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **John as a Back-up:**  Knowing John will buy it for $800,000 provides a safety net, ensuring we don't need to go below that price.

**This strategy aims for a high initial offer, maximizing potential profit while still being appealing enough for Bob to consider seriously.**"
