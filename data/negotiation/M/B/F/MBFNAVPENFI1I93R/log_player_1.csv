Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and also higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the fairness of the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I hope to secure a price closer to my target of $1,000,000 or even higher.
* **Encourage Bob to counter-offer:** By making a high initial offer, I encourage Bob to make a counter-offer, giving us a chance to find a compromise.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I can always fall back to the $1,000,000 offer from John if Bob's counter-offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to risk losing the sale to Bob to see if I can secure a better price.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I'm willing to walk away. This increases my leverage in the negotiation.
* **Explore counter-offers:** I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by counter-offering. Bob is already showing interest, and a well-crafted counter-offer could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **Backup option:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through. This gives me a safety net and prevents me from accepting an offer that is below my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking for a little closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing willingness to negotiate by offering a price that's closer to his offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the potential for a ""win-win"" scenario, making the offer more appealing.
* **Fairness:** I'm using the word ""fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and imply that my offer is reasonable.

**Strategy:**

* **Gradual Approach:**  I'm gradually reducing my price, hoping to find a sweet spot where Bob is willing to accept.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give me a better understanding of how close I can get to my desired price while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still holding out for a better price, but I'm also showing flexibility to ensure the negotiation doesn't break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob outweighs the potential benefits.

**Strategy:**

* **Safety Net:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on a potentially better deal.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and energy, potentially costing me valuable time and opportunity.
* **Limited Upside:**  Bob has already shown a reluctance to meet my price, making it unlikely that further negotiations will lead to a significantly better offer. 

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed outcome and minimize the risk of a less favorable deal."
