Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential profit for me.
* **The message:** It's positive and friendly, highlighting the value proposition for Bob. It also leaves the door open for further negotiation. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $12,000.
* **Keep the negotiation going:** This keeps Bob engaged and prevents him from immediately turning to another seller.
* **Avoid immediate rejection:**  A lower price might lead Bob to reject my offer right away. 

Remember, this is just an initial offer. I'm prepared to counter-offer based on Bob's response and adjust my strategy depending on the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept such a low price. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain my leverage:** It shows Bob that I'm not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Continue negotiating:** I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **Explore other options:** If Bob refuses to budge, I can still sell to John for $12,000, guaranteeing my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $9,500:** This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It's still above Bob's perceived value but allows for further negotiation.
* **Positive messaging:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of reaching a mutually acceptable outcome.
* **Highlighting value:** Emphasizing the ""good deal"" for Bob reinforces his interest in the product while reminding him of its value.

This counteroffer strategy aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  It allows for potential compromise and increases the likelihood of closing the deal.
* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Keep the pressure on Bob:** By not accepting his initial offer, I put the onus on him to counter-offer again if he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500, but I'm still not quite there. How about $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $12,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, accepting this offer brings several benefits:

* **Closing the deal:**  It secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potential rejection.
* **Minimizing risk:** It eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation and ensures a guaranteed profit.
* **Potential for future business:**  A successful negotiation with Bob could lead to future opportunities.

While I'm slightly disappointed in not getting a higher price, accepting Bob's offer at this point is the most strategic and practical decision to secure a reasonable profit."
