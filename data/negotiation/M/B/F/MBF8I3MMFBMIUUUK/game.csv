"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500, but I'm still not quite there. How about $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
