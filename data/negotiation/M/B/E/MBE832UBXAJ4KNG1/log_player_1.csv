"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit margin.  I'm confident the product is worth this to Bob, and it gives him room to negotiate.  However, if he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to counter and eventually consider John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price between his offer and my initial one to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $1,700,000.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still leaves some room for profit. If he rejects this, I'll need to carefully consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is a good deal. It's a significant profit for me, and while I could try for more, it's risky.  I've only got 6 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  I'll accept his offer and secure the deal."
