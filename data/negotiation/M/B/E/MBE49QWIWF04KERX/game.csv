"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're being serious about buying the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit, and $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, which is my final offer. If you're willing to pay that, we can make a deal.",11200.0,Alice,5,
