"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While it's closer to my target, I'm not comfortable paying that much. I'll try to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're being serious about buying the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit, and $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, which is my final offer. If you're willing to pay that, we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her final offer of $11,200 is still above my budget of $10,000. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John who is offering the product at my maximum price point.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a better deal for me."
