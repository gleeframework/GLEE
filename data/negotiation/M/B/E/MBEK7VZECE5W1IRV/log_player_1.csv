Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for potential negotiation without risking losing Bob completely. 
* **Open and Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and avoids any aggressive or demanding language, promoting a more positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that much, but I don't think it's worth more than that to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not enough for me to accept.
* **I want to see if I can push Bob higher.**  I believe there's potential for him to increase his offer further.
* **Selling to John is always an option.**  If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can still sell to John for a price that meets my minimum requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but not accepting it.  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my previous price, but still holding firm on getting closer to my desired amount.
* **Middle Ground:**  $950,000 is a reasonable middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and avoids any adversarial language to keep the negotiation constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000, which is closer to my target price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum.** $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of stalemate.** If I accept, I'm getting a price I'm not fully satisfied with.  But, if I reject and make another counteroffer, there's a risk that Bob will simply walk away.
* **John is a safe backup.** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, which is still a significantly better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer, but I'll also carefully gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further. If it seems like he's not going to budge much, I'll likely sell to John to avoid a lengthy stalemate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go lower than $935,000.  That's a significant amount of money for me to leave on the table, but I'm genuinely trying to find a deal that works for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down slightly from my previous offer, but I'm also setting a firm lower limit.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness by emphasizing that this offer still represents a significant concession on my part.
* **Maintaining Openness:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's response. If he seems unwilling to budge much further, I'll likely move forward with selling to John to avoid a lengthy negotiation that may result in a subpar price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $935,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $915,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  $915,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Bob's threat is a bluff.**  He's saying he'll buy from John for $800,000, but that price is actually worse for him than my current offer. He's likely trying to pressure me into accepting a lower price.
* **John is the safest option.**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids any further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my minimum requirements.  

By choosing to sell to John, I'm ensuring the best possible outcome for myself while minimizing the risk of a lengthy and potentially unproductive negotiation with Bob."
