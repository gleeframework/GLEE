Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,800? This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8800}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
