Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that it might be rejected.  However, this sets a strong starting point for negotiation.  It's important to keep in mind that John's offer of $1,500,000 is my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price and my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation, I'm going to try to get a better price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and ensures I receive a price that is above my minimum acceptable threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is a good compromise, and it's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'd rather not risk further negotiation and potentially losing a sale to John.  It's time to accept Bob's offer and move on."
