{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This offer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, she might be willing to accept a price closer to her value."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly better than her initial offer. It's still not a good deal for you.  Rejecting it allows you to continue to negotiate and try to get a better price. You can always fall back to buying from John for $100 if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is showing she's willing to negotiate a bit, but it's still not the best deal for you. This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, but still below her current price.  You're trying to meet her halfway, but maintain some leverage."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is again offering a price that's closer to her desired value than yours.  You should keep negotiating, as you can still get a better price. It's still within your budget to buy from John, so you have a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

**Explanation:**

You've been consistently offering prices below $90, and Alice has been coming down slowly. This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing that you are willing to compromise but still trying to get the best price possible.  It's a reasonable compromise that might convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is the best deal you've seen so far.  It's slightly above your last counteroffer, but it's still a good price considering you can buy from John for $100. It's likely that if you reject this offer, Alice will either stick to her current offer or come back with a higher price. 

Accepting this offer ensures you get the product for a good price and avoids further negotiation."
