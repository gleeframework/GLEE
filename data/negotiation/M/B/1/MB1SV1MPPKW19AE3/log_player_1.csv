Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already in a good position.
* **It's not too aggressive:** It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. 
* **The message is friendly and inviting:** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7000? I think that's a fair price considering the value you've described. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is above your minimum, you can likely get a better price. You know John is willing to pay $8,000, and Bob clearly has room to negotiate.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives you the chance to counter with a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a price closer to your desired value:** This counteroffer is still above your minimum ($8,000) and more aligned with John's offer.  
* **Be firm but friendly:** The message reiterates your willingness to negotiate, while also highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:** This keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $7500? I think that's a fair price considering the value you've described. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $7,500 is closer to your desired price, it's still below John's offer of $8,000. You have a guaranteed sale with John, so you're not under pressure to accept a price lower than that. 

Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open. You can counter again with a price closer to $8,000, or potentially even accept John's offer if the negotiation with Bob becomes too time-consuming."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to keep working with you. However, I can't go any lower than $8,000. This is still a fantastic price for the value you'll receive, and it's the best I can offer.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This is your last counteroffer, emphasizing that you're firm on your minimum price. 
* **Focus on the value:** Remind Bob that $8,000 is a fair price considering the product's worth.
* **Encourage a decision:** This message pushes Bob to make a decision, making it clear that further negotiation is unlikely.

You're now at your minimum price, so you can either accept Bob's offer if he comes up or move on to John."
