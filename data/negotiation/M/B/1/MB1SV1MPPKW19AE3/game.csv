"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7000? I think that's a fair price considering the value you've described.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to keep working with you. However, I can't go any lower than $8000. This is still a fantastic price for the value you'll receive, and it's the best I can offer.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward!",8000.0,Alice,5,
