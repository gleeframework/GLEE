"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1600000 is still significantly below what I consider a fair price. I'm willing to come down to $1800000, reflecting a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1700000. Can we meet at this price?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep exploring options.  $1700000 is close, but I'm still feeling a bit short. How about $1750000?  This feels like a fair compromise and might be our final chance to reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1750000. I'm willing to go up to $1700000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",1700000.0,Bob,6,
