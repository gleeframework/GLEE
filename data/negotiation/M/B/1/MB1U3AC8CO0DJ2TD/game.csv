"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm prepared to offer $950000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. My new offer is $1025000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $1025000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $975000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My new offer is $1050000. Let's see if we can get to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
