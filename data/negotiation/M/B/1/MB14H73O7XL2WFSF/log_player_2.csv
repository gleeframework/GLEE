"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe holds great value for those who appreciate its unique features and benefits. For this exceptional item, I propose a price of $150. This offer includes not only the product itself but also a comprehensive guide on how to maximize its usage and a limited-time access to exclusive customer support. I trust that you will find this proposal attractive and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150 and John is willing to sell the product for that price, it's the most logical choice. You don't have any information about the value of the product to Alice, so there's no reason to risk paying more."
