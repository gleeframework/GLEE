Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering Bob the product for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly more than my minimum desired price of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer, as it's still below the product's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is very close to my desired price, and accepting it secures a sale. It is not worth risking a further negotiation, especially as I can secure a sale with John for $8,000 if this deal falls through."
