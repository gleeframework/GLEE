"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great opportunity for you. I'm offering you a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is lower than John's price of $10,000, you know you can get the product for a maximum of $10,000. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of negotiating a better price with her or sticking with John as a backup."
