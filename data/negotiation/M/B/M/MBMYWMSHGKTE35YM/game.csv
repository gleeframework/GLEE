"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $8500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $9000.  This is a good deal for both of us, as I'm sure you'll agree.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I'll meet you at $9250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
