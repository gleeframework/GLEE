Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to your minimum ($1,500,000) ensures the highest potential profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so you need to go significantly higher to entice him.
* **John as Leverage:** Mentioning another buyer creates urgency and implies the product is desirable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price higher than John's offer. 

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
