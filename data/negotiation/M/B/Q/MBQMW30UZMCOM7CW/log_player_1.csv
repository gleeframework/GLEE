Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I'd sell to John. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, but still leaves me with a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price and I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob at $150. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that it's a fair price given that I could sell to John for the same amount. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Selling to John for $150 is the best option at this point."
