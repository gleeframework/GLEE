Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $885000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $885,000 is very close to my desired price. Accepting this offer will save me a substantial amount compared to buying from John and still leaves Alice with a good profit.  It's a win-win situation, and I'm comfortable closing the deal at this point."
