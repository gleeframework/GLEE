"I understand you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I can see you're willing to walk away if you don't get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'll sell the product to you for $12,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go higher than $9,000. If you're willing to meet me there, we have a deal. ",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.
