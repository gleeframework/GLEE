"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a price of $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's best not to accept the first offer. There's room for negotiation, and we know John offers a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. This approach aims to understand Alice's flexibility and how low she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice moved closer to our desired price, but it's still higher than John's offer.  We have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $9,250?  I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9250
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're moving closer to both John's price and Alice's latest offer.  By suggesting a specific number, we signal our seriousness while still leaving some room for negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met our bottom line, matching John's price. There's no benefit to further negotiation or going with John, as the price will be the same."
