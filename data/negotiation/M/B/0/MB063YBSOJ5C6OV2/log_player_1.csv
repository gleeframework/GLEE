Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. It's a good deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $125 as the offer price. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $100, giving me a profit. It's also lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I'm still making some money even if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and persuasive, highlighting the value proposition of the product and emphasizing the ""win-win"" aspect of the deal. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** By setting a price above Bob's value, I aim to maximize my profit while still potentially securing a sale.
* **Mitigate risk:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, guaranteeing I don't lose money."
