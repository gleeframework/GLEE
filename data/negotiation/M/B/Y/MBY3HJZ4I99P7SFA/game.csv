"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your position, $8,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider $15,000? I'm willing to be flexible for a quick deal.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $15,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair offer considering the market value.",11000.0,Bob,4,
