"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my target price. How about we settle on $900,000? This still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product has significant value, and I am serious about buying it.  To be realistic though, I need to stay within my budget. Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $725,000 is still a bit too low, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $850,000? This offer reflects the value of the product while still giving you a good price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
