Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,700,000. This is a price higher than his perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 

**Rationale:**

* **Maximize Potential Gain:** This offer gives me a good chance of getting a price closer to my desired value. While Bob might reject it, it sets the stage for a negotiation that could lead to a higher price. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $1,700,000 leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential compromise. 
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** This approach balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the reward of potentially securing a sale closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer, depending on the proposed price.
* If Bob accepts my offer, I will finalize the sale and earn $1,700,000.
* If negotiations with Bob fail, I will move on to John and secure a sale for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount of money, it falls short of my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product.

**Rationale:**

* **Maintain Value:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling the product for less than its worth to me. I believe the product has greater potential value.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiations and potentially secure a better price. I can leverage my minimum acceptable price and John's willingness to pay $1,500,000 to gain leverage.
* **Risk Management:** Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum acceptable price, but I'm willing to take a calculated risk in hopes of getting a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. 
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will evaluate the situation and either make a new counteroffer or sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still significantly higher than his last offer. 

**Rationale:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $1,400,000 is a halfway point between my last offer and Bob's, showing that I'm taking his interests into consideration.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  While I'm willing to compromise, this offer doesn't give away too much and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
* If Bob accepts my offer, I will finalize the sale and earn $1,400,000.
* If negotiations with Bob fail, I will move on to John and secure a sale for $1,500,000."
