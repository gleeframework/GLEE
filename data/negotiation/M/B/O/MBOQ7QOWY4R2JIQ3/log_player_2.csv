"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible.  Since you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that exact price, there's no benefit to buying from her. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with John, or even find a better deal elsewhere.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open."
