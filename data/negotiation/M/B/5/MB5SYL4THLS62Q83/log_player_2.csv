Alice's offer of $795,000 is only slightly above my previous counteroffer of $780,000. With only one round left, it's time to close the deal. While I might be able to get a slightly lower price if I continue negotiating, it's not worth the risk of losing the product entirely. Accepting this offer saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
