Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 from John.

**Optimal Strategy**

Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her minimum acceptable price, she should aim to get as much as possible from Bob. There's no risk of losing the $1,500,000.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe its true value is significant, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Price:** The offer price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation and even Alice's minimum. This leaves room for negotiation but starts at a point highly favorable to Alice.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, potentially pushing Bob to consider the offer more seriously. 
* **""True Value"":**  By mentioning the ""true value,"" Alice subtly implies that Bob's valuation might be undervaluing the product.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** This offer anticipates negotiation. Bob is likely to counter-offer. 
* **Flexibility:** Alice has room to negotiate down to her minimum price ($1,500,000) while still making a profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  It's crucial Alice doesn't reveal she has another buyer lined up. This information weakens her negotiating position."
