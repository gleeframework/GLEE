"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $950,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $875,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920,000. I believe this is the minimum price I can accept, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",920000.0,Alice,5,
