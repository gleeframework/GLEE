"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $950,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $875,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920,000. I believe this is the minimum price I can accept, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much.  She's come down some, but I'm not confident I can get her lower than $900,000.  At this point, it's more efficient to go with John's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's within my budget and will save me time and potential frustration with further negotiations."
