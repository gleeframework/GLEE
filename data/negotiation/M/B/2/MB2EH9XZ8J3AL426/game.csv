"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12500 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, Bob. I can offer it to you for $9750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I can offer it to you for $9500. This is the final offer I'm willing to make. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me at $9500, but I'm still not willing to go above $8000. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I don't get a better price. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $8000. If not, I'll buy the product from John for $8000.",8000.0,Bob,10,
