"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  This way, we both get a fair price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $8,750 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,000 again, but I'll throw in a small bonus for you, like a free maintenance package?",9000.0,Alice,5,
