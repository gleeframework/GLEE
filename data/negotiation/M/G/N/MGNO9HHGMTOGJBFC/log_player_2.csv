"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $175 is significantly higher than both your maximum price ($100) and John's offer ($100). It makes the most financial sense to buy from John."
