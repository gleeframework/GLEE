"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can get out of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $750,000 is too low for me, and I'm hoping we can come to a more agreeable price.  I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I understand your perspective, $750,000 is significantly below what I need for this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. Can we compromise on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough one, but Bob's offer of $825,000 is closer to my minimum than John's offer of $800,000. I'm going to take it and move on."
