"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still slightly higher than where I can realistically go at this point. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let's try $11,000. This would leave us both with a good margin of profit and ensure a smooth transaction.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $11,750. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway again. However,  $11,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can finalize this deal at $11,250. It's a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. What do you say?",11250.0,Bob,6,
