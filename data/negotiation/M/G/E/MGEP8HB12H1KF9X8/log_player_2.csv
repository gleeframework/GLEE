"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is a good starting point because it is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $900,000, but still higher than her value of $800,000. 
* This suggests you are serious about buying the product, but you are also looking for a good deal.
*  It gives Alice room to counter if she wants to continue the negotiation."

**Next Steps:**

You should make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your previous offer of $850,000. This shows that you are willing to compromise, but also that you are not willing to pay an unreasonable price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

* It's likely that further negotiation will not lead to a significantly lower price.
* Buying from John for $1,500,000 will guarantee you the product, even if it's not your ideal price.
