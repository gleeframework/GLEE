Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's a reasonable markup from my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and my desire to maximize profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to maximize my profit, I'm not willing to settle for $10,000 when I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good price for me, and it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate.  If Bob rejects this offer again, I might consider selling to John, but I'll see if we can reach a deal first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to keep negotiating. While I'd prefer to get more than $12,000, I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer, and I don't want to risk losing out on the deal altogether.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000."
