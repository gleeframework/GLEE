``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum value ($10,000), but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting a higher price.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below what I need to make. I'll try to counter-offer Bob to see if we can bridge the gap a bit more."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250

While $8,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm still not quite there at $8,250, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $8,375? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8375}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $8375. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is the price I was originally offered by John. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $8,000 is still below my minimum value, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will result in a better deal.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000. While I'm not getting my ideal price, it's a secure deal that meets my minimum requirement."
