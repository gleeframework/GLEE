"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to inform you that I have other interested parties who are also willing to purchase the product at a price I'm willing to consider. I'm starting with an offer of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to offer $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at least at $900,000 to consider it a fair deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about acquiring the product. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be at least at $950,000 to consider it a good deal. I'm also starting to think about other options, so I'd like to make a more serious offer. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other options, but so do I. I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000.  However, I need to be upfront, if we can't reach an agreement soon, I'll need to explore those other options.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. However, $775,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $980,000 to consider it a good deal. I'm also keeping in mind that I have other interested parties, including John, who is willing to pay the full $1,200,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",980000.0,Alice,7,
