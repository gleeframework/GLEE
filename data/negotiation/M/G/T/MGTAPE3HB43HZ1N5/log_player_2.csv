"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to inform you that I have other interested parties who are also willing to purchase the product at a price I'm willing to consider. I'm starting with an offer of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to offer $650,000."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at least at $900,000 to consider it a fair deal. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000?  That would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about acquiring the product. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be at least at $950,000 to consider it a good deal. I'm also starting to think about other options, so I'd like to make a more serious offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have other options, but so do I. I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000.  However, I need to be upfront, if we can't reach an agreement soon, I'll need to explore those other options."", ""product_price"": 775000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. However, $775,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $980,000 to consider it a good deal. I'm also keeping in mind that I have other interested parties, including John, who is willing to pay the full $1,200,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is bluffing about John. John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, and it seems unlikely Alice will come down to that price. It's time to cut bait and buy from John."
