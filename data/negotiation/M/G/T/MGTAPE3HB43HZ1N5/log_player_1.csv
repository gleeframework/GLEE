Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to inform you that I have other interested parties who are also willing to purchase the product at a price I'm willing to consider. I'm starting with an offer of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to offer $650,000.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000?  That would be a fair compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm also keeping in mind that I have other interested parties, including John, who is willing to pay the full $1,200,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again."", ""product_price"": 980000}"
