Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but gives Bob room to negotiate.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.  It shows flexibility while still being above my minimum.  Hopefully, Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $16,000 is a good price, and it's above my minimum.  There's a chance I could get more by continuing to negotiate, but there's also a chance I could end up selling to John for $15,000. Accepting Bob's offer gives me a guaranteed profit."
