"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $150? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 just isn't workable for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go to $135.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this.",135.0,Alice,5,
