"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price.  Let's say $120. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a product you value highly, and I get a good price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is overpriced. You can do better by either negotiating a lower price with Alice or buying from John for $150."
