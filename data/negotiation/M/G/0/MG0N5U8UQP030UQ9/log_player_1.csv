Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $130. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters, and it also sets the initial expectation that the product has value beyond its base worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth around $120. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. While I'd prefer to make a bit more, it's not worth risking a longer negotiation."
