"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $18,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is far more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm offering $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $10,000. This is a fair offer given the value you placed on it and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Waiting and hoping he'll reach $12,000 is risky.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum and avoids potentially lengthy and fruitless negotiations."
