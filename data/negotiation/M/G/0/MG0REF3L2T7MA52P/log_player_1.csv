Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is already at his maximum valuation of the product. There is no room for negotiation to get a higher price from him.  It's better to take the guaranteed $80 from John."
