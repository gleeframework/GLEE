Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects the offer.  If he rejects, I will consider his counteroffer, but I also have the option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $10,500. This is a compromise that is halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for him to accept, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still too low. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed sale for my minimum price with John."
