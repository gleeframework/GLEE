"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but based on my budget, I am unable to meet the price of $1150000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1050000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for your specific needs.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This allows for a fair margin for both of us and ensures we both get a good deal.  I'm confident this product will deliver significant returns for you, making this a smart investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I believe the product is worth less than $1100000 to me. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1075000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
