Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and this price reflects that while still providing me with a fair return."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, and we can always come down a bit. 
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering a price too close to $12,000 might make Bob hesitant, as it leaves him little room to negotiate. 

This strategy balances getting a high price while ensuring Bob is likely to accept the offer over losing out entirely."
