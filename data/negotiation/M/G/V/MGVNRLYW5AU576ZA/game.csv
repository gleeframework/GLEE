"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is my final offer in this range, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is tempting, I need to be firm at $1,080,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional value.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
