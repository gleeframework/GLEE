"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where I'm still making a profit, but leaving room for potential negotiation.  I'm optimistic Bob will see the value and accept, but I'm prepared to counter his offers if necessary.  I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $12,000 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, I'm not going to sell for that amount yet. I'm confident in the value of my product and I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob. I have 8 more rounds and can always sell to John for $12,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I can't accept your offer. My product is worth significantly more than $8,000. Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $9,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While $9,500 is closer to my target price of $8,000, I still believe we can reach a fair compromise. I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and with only 6 rounds left, it's a good deal.  If I reject, I may not get a better offer from Bob and I'm risking losing out to John. I'll accept this offer."
