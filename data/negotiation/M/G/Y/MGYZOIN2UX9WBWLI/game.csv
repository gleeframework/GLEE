"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm trying to stick to a budget of around $130. Would you be willing to meet me there?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to a budget, but $130 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about $145? It's closer to your offer and still allows me to make a fair profit.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $137.50?",137.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $137.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $142.50.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",142.5,Alice,7,
