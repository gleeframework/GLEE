"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This is an aggressive opening that allows for room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob is enthusiastic about the product and will be willing to pay a premium. If not, we can work down from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a good offer, I'm not willing to accept it just yet.  I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm offering $900,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still giving me a comfortable profit. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still holding my ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good offer that's above my minimum price and a decent amount of profit. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
