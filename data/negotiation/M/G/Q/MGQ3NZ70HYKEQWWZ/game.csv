"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that my product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,320,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1320000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,320,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,250,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,280,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,280,000 is pushing my absolute limit.  I could go up to $1,265,000, but that's the best I can do.",1265000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $1,265,000 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'm not willing to give up any more value. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,265,000, but I need to make it clear that this is my final offer. If you're willing to accept, I'll consider it a done deal.",1265000.0,Alice,7,
