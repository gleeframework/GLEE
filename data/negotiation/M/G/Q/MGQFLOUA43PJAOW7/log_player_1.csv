"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $160, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. This is still above my minimum and hopefully closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is very close to my minimum. I'd rather not risk losing out on the deal entirely, so I'll accept his offer."
