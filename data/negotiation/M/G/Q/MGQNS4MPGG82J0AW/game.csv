"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $1,200,000. It's the most I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're committed to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
