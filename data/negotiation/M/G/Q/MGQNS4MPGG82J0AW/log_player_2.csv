Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,400,000, which is still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

You should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her original offer, it is still above your budget. You should try to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can reach a price you are comfortable with."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $1,200,000. It's the most I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're committed to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

At this point, it's clear Alice won't budge much further. You've already reached your absolute limit of $1,200,000, and any further negotiation is likely to be unproductive. It's time to take John's offer and secure the product at the price you're comfortable with."
