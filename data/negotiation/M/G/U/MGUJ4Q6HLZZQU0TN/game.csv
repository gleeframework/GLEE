"Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",15500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $17,000. This still represents a good value for you, and allows for a fair profit for me. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $17,000. I'm still willing to go a bit higher, but $16,000 is the absolute maximum I can do.  Let's make this happen!",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and settle on $16,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and lets us close this deal.",16500.0,Alice,5,
