Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves a buffer for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your $800,000 minimum. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer to make it more appealing.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000."
