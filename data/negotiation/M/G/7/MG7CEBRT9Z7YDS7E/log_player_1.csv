**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, the difference between his offer ($1,450,000) and John's standing offer ($1,500,000) is now quite small.  

It's unlikely Bob will reach $1,500,000 quickly, and continuing the negotiation has a risk: Bob could walk away, or negotiations could stall, leaving Alice with a less favorable outcome.

Therefore, the most logical decision at this point is to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
