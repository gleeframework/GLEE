"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $92, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting closer to the price I was hoping for, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $98. I think the product is worth it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we meet at $99?",99.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm  appreciating your flexibility, but $99 is still a little more than I'm aiming for. How about we settle at $94? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",94.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $96? It's a great price for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product.",96.0,Alice,7,
