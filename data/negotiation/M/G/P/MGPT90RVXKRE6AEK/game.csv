"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $13,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $9,750? I feel like that's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
