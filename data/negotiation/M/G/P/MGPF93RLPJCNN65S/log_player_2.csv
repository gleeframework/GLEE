"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's aiming for a price closer to $800,000, and Alice's initial offer is too high.  He has 9 rounds left to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my range. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while still allowing me to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from $1,000,000 to $950,000,  Bob's goal is to get the product as close to $800,000 as possible. Rejecting her offer and continuing the negotiation will allow him to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and aim for $900,000.  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, allowing for a good return on your investment while making the product viable for me."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $900,000 is still not quite there. Let's try $925,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives you a good price and allows me to move closer to my desired value.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $925,000 is closer to Bob's goal, he still has several rounds left to negotiate. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to try and bring the price down further. He's already shown a willingness to meet halfway, and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise. There's still room for both parties to come to an agreement that is more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $910,000? This price is a fair compromise, closer to your target than my last offer, while allowing me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference again and aim for $915,000. This brings us closer to an agreement, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $915,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, he's now only got 3 rounds left. With only 3 rounds remaining, the likelihood of negotiating a price below $900,000 is low.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $800,000, securing the product and ensuring he stays within his budget."
