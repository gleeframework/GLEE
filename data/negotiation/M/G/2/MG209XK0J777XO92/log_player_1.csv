{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives you some room to negotiate down if necessary.  I chose to offer a price slightly above the midpoint between your value and Bob's value to signal a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $7,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it also shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and meet at $8,000?  That seems fair given John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price. Although I could try to get a higher price, it's not a big difference, and there is no guarantee that I can achieve a better deal in the next round. 

Accepting Bob's offer will ensure I sell the product and don't risk losing the deal entirely."
