Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob. However, I've already come down a significant amount from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $10,800. It's better to secure the product from John at $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
