"Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $50.  Would that work for you?",50.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. However, given the quality and uniqueness of the product, I am unable to accept $50. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $75, which I believe strikes a fair balance between the value we place on the product and your budget. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you were considering.",75.0,Alice,3,
