Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that you are confident in the value of your product.  By setting a high initial price, you establish a starting point that allows for more room to negotiate downwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer to try to secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial price, showing flexibility.  However, it is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, and closer to my desired value. It shows willingness to negotiate but also  asserts a reasonable expectation for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's lower than my previous offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate further.  However, it's still significantly higher than Bob's latest offer, demonstrating that I believe my product is worth more.  If Bob still rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price point.  While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it doesn't meet my financial goals. Selling to John ensures I reach my desired price and avoids further negotiation."
