Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  To be honest, I'm really close to accepting John's offer of $15,000. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would be a significant discount for you compared to John's offer, and it's a price I can comfortably work with.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go substantially lower than her current offer.  She's using John's offer as leverage, even though it might not be entirely true.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $8,000 than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a worse deal."
