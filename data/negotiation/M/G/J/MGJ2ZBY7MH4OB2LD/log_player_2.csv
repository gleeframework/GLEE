"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $850,000. I know this is a valuable product, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer at $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is bluffing.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay Alice's inflated price."
