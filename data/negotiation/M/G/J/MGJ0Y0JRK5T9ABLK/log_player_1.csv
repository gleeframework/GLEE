Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter based on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While I am willing to sell for $12,000, Bob's offer is at the absolute minimum.  I will counteroffer to see if I can get a slightly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I hope it's attractive enough for him to accept, but still allows me to get a bit more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could counteroffer again, there's no guarantee he'll budge further, and I risk wasting more time. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and it's the most efficient choice at this point."
