# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which has been meticulously designed to meet the highest standards of quality and performance. This unique offering is not just a product; it's an investment in excellence. We believe its value extends far beyond its monetary worth, making it a true asset for those who appreciate the finer things. Considering its exceptional features and benefits, I propose a starting price of $500000. I look forward to discussing this opportunity with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the features you've highlighted, $500,000 is significantly lower than what I'm able to pay.  Given my budget and the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to secure a substantial sale."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
