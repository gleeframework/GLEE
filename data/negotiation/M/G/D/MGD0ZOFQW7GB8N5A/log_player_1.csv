Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the features you've highlighted, $500000 is significantly lower than what I'm able to pay.  Given my budget and the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to offer $1000000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to secure a substantial sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
