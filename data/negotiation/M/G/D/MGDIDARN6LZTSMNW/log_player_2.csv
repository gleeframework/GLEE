"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible while still getting the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** $90, which is still higher than Bob's maximum value of $100.
* **Next Steps:** Bob should try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting Alice's offer allows for counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Counter Offer Logic:**  Offering $85 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still above Alice's minimum value. 
* **Potential Outcome:** This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to reconsider her price. If she's willing to negotiate, she might accept.  If not, Bob can continue to adjust his offers in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $87.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $87.50, which is closer to Bob's desired price point.
* **Comparison to John:**  While buying from John for $100 is still an option, accepting this offer from Alice saves Bob $2.50.
* **Potential Outcome:** Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's acceptable to Bob and likely still a good deal for Alice.  

**Key Consideration:**  Bob has already rejected one offer and countered.  While he could continue negotiating, accepting Alice's offer in this round minimizes risk and ensures he gets the product without further negotiation."
