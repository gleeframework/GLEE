Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and you'll be getting it at a significant discount. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $800,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000, but this offer still gives you a significant profit. 
* **It signals you're serious:** It shows you're willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell.

This allows for potential counteroffers and a back-and-forth negotiation, while still keeping your minimum value in mind.  If Bob rejects, you can then consider John's offer or make a counteroffer depending on how the negotiation goes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I want to maximize my profit, and selling to John would guarantee that. I can also try to negotiate further with Bob by making a counteroffer. This allows me to potentially achieve a better price without resorting to selling to John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This still gives you a significant discount, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** By lowering the price to $1,350,000, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Still above my minimum:**  I'm not willing to go below $1,500,000, so $1,350,000 remains a profitable deal for me.
* **Positioning for a potential agreement:** By offering a price that is closer to what Bob is willing to pay, I'm increasing the likelihood of reaching a final agreement. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still protecting my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose a price of $1300000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise given the value of the product to both parties. I hope you find this proposal acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While I would prefer to sell for $1,500,000, $1,300,000 is only $200,000 below my minimum. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** There's still a chance I might be able to negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob in the future. 
* **Risk of losing John's offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for $1,500,000. 

Given the close proximity of Bob's offer to my minimum value and the potential risk of losing John's offer, accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
