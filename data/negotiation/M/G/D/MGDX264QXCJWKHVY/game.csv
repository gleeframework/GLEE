"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is quite valuable, and $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go higher than $11,500. Let's try to find a compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
