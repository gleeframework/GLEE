"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $10500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11500 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13500. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll meet you in the middle at $13000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept.",12000.0,Bob,6,
