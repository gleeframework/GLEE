"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of the value of our product. While we aim to accommodate all our clients within their budgets, I must respectfully decline your current offer. I would like to counter with a proposal of $950,000. This price still allows us to cover our costs and provide a fair margin while offering significant value to your business. I hope this revised offer aligns more closely with your budget considerations.",950000.0,Alice,3,
