"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,100,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. That said,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $1,900,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
