"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our unique and valuable product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I can only go up to $900000. This is a fair price considering the value I've seen in similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product can bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to an agreement, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $980000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can seal the deal.",980000.0,Alice,5,
