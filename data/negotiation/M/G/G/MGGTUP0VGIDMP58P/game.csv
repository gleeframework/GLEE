"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, so how about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
