You're still above your maximum budget of $12,000. While Alice's offer is closer to your price range, you can try to negotiate further.  Reject the offer and try a counteroffer."

Alice's offer is $15,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $12,000.  You can continue to negotiate, but since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $12,000, it's the best choice to avoid further haggling and just purchase from John."
