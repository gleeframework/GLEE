"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something of immense value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too steep for my budget right now. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,000? If that works, we have a deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $12,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Can you meet me at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,500?  That's my final offer.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'll give you a slight concession, but I need $11,000 to make this deal work for me. Can you meet me at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,7,
