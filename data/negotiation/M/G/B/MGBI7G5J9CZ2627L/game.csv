"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1000000.  I understand this is a valuable product to you, so I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure I can justify going above my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of the value of this product. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  This represents a significant amount for me, and I'm confident it would still be a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1050000.  However, I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to go to $1100000?  I'm confident that this price would still be a good value for you considering the product's worth.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
