"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1000000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal compared to Alice's valuation, Bob can get the product for a lower price from John.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  I understand this is a valuable product to you, so I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure I can justify going above my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of the value of this product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above what he could get from John.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant amount for me, and I'm confident it would still be a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1050000.  However, I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to go to $1100000?  I'm confident that this price would still be a good value for you considering the product's worth.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is stuck at $1,100,000.  Bob has already offered his maximum at $1,050,000.  Continuing to negotiate will likely lead to further stalemates.  Since John is willing to sell at $1,000,000, it's in Bob's best interest to end the negotiation with Alice and secure the product from John at a lower price."
