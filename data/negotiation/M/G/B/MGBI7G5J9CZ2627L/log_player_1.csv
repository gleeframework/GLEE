{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:** This ensures you don't sell the product for less than your minimum. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It leaves room for further negotiation without immediately reaching your minimum acceptable value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1000000.  I understand this is a valuable product to you, so I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure I can justify going above my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of the value of this product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  This represents a significant amount for me, and I'm confident it would still be a good deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can squeeze out a little more in the next round."
