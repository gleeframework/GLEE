Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) than mine ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is designed to be polite but firm, gauging Bob's interest without revealing my minimum price.
* **Backup Plan:**  I keep in mind John's offer of $100. If negotiations with Bob don't go well, I can always walk away and take the guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $120 is closer to my minimum price, but it's still a significant profit above my $100 baseline. I'll counteroffer to see if I can push the price a bit higher before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and signal flexibility by coming down from my initial price.
* **Split the Difference:**  This classic negotiation tactic is often perceived as fair and might encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining Profit:** The $125 price point still represents a solid profit margin above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we do $122.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could try to push for a few more dollars, the difference between $122.50 and my next counteroffer is likely to be small.  
* **Strong Profit:** $122.50 is still a very good profit margin ($22.50 above my minimum) and significantly better than John's standing offer.
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and secures the sale."
