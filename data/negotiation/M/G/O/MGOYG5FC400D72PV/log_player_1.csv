Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to build rapport and keep Bob engaged.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I highlight the product's value to subtly remind Bob of its worth.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I've secured a profitable deal.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to analyze Bob's counteroffer and decide whether it's worth pursuing further or moving on to John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am only willing to pay $850000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.**  While it's closer to my desired price, it's not yet profitable enough to justify a sale.
* **I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which is significantly more than Bob's offer.**  This provides a strong benchmark for comparison.
* **I believe I can likely secure a better price from Bob by counteroffering.** By continuing the negotiation, I have the opportunity to potentially increase the price and get closer to my minimum acceptable price. 

**Next Step:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price higher than $850,000 but lower than my original offer of $900,000.  This will allow me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price slightly, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Reinforcement:** I reiterate the product's value to keep the focus on its worth.
* **Mutually Beneficial:** I emphasize the potential for a win-win outcome, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! This secures a decent price that's closer to my desired range.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll need to assess the situation. If Bob's next counteroffer is too low, I might consider selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000. However, if Bob's offer gets closer to my target price, I'll continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I am comfortable increasing my offer to $860000. I believe this strikes a good balance between the product's worth and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.** While his offer is closer to my target price, it's still not profitable enough to justify a sale at this point.
* **I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which is significantly more than Bob's offer.** This provides a strong benchmark for comparison and makes selling to Bob less appealing.
* **While continuing the negotiation could potentially lead to a better offer from Bob, the risk of him walking away and the time involved make it less desirable.** The potential gains from further negotiation may not outweigh the time investment and the possibility of Bob eventually walking away.

**Next Step:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, but will be very firm and aim for a price closer to $900,000. I'll be willing to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $860,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and the potential it holds for you, I'm prepared to come down to $890,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that price, I'll have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm setting a firm price and letting Bob know it's my final offer. This puts the pressure on him to make a decision.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value and its potential benefit to Bob, hoping to persuade him to meet my price.
* **Clear Consequences:** I'm making it clear that if he doesn't accept, I'll move on to other options. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** This secures a price closer to my target, though still below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm willing to accept it as my final offer. 
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll immediately sell the product to John for $1,000,000, as further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to lead to a better outcome."
