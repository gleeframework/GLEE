"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with an offer significantly lower than my maximum budget ($8,000) and Alice's asking price ($9,500), I leave room for negotiation.  
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help me understand how flexible Alice is on price.  If she's willing to come down significantly, it might be worth continuing the negotiation.  If not, I can always take John's offer. 
* **Polite and Direct:** I want to maintain a positive tone to encourage further discussion while clearly stating my price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $7,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $8,500? This still gives you a good price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to my budget, but I'm still getting a better deal from John at $8,000. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push Alice a bit further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the effort. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $7,750, I'm splitting the difference between her latest offer ($8,500) and my previous offer ($7,000). This can be a fair negotiation tactic and might be appealing to Alice.
* **Still Below Budget:**  This offer keeps me below my $8,000 maximum, ensuring I still get a better deal than John's offer if Alice accepts.
* **Leaving Room for One More Round:**  If Alice rejects this offer, I might have space for one more counteroffer that's still under my budget, depending on her response."
