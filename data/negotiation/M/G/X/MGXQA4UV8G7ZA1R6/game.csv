"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000. Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $7,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $8,500? This still gives you a good price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
