"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I'm flexible and willing to discuss this further.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little over my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but I need to get closer to my desired price point.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, but that's my absolute minimum.  Think about the value this product will bring you, and let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",8000.0,Alice,5,
