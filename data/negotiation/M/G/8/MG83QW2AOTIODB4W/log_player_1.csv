Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000, a price that reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers a substantial saving compared to my guaranteed sale price.
* **Confident Messaging:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly justifying the high price point.

**Outcome:**

This offer gives Bob a strong incentive to negotiate while keeping my profit potential high. If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can gradually lower the price, knowing I have John as a backup buyer."
