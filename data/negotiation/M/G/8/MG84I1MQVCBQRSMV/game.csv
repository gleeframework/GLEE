"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its true value to you. Let's get this deal finalized!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $700,000 is far below the value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000.  This offer still gives you a great deal, and allows me to get a fair price for my product.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  The product is truly worth more than that, and I need to ensure I receive a fair price.  How about we compromise at $825,000? It's a reasonable price for both of us, and I believe it would make this a good deal for you. Let's close this deal now.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
