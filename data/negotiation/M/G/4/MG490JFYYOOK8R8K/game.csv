"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make a deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750000 is too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $850000, which is a fair compromise. This price still allows me to meet my minimum requirements while giving you a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let's meet halfway.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $800000, which is the maximum I can afford. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
