"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a stronger starting position.
* **Fairness Justification:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to establish a baseline and avoid being perceived as unreasonable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, showing I'm open to dialogue. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is genuinely interested in the product and will likely counteroffer. If he rejects immediately, I'll need to reassess and potentially turn to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a steep discount this early in the process. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair compromise. This price still allows me to meet my minimum requirements while giving you a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Position:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns to show I'm listening and willing to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's ""true value"" to justify my counteroffer.
* **Compromise Framing:** I'm presenting the $850,000 as a ""fair compromise"" and ""meeting halfway"" to encourage Bob to see it as a reasonable step towards a deal.
* **Opportunity Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential value of acquiring the product to incentivize him to consider my offer.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the Gap:**  Reduce the price gap but still ensure I'm above my minimum threshold.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Avoid showing too much willingness to concede early on.
* **Position for Further Negotiation:**  Set the stage for further dialogue and potential compromises in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $800000, which is the maximum I can afford. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has finally offered my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's in my best interest to accept his offer and close the deal. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and time is a factor.  

While I could potentially try for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob rejecting and me potentially losing him as a buyer isn't worth it at this point."
