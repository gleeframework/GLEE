"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better deal than $12,000, Bob can likely get it for closer to his $10,000 limit. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle at $11000? This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than his ideal price. Bob has already shown he's willing to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $11250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a little, $11,250 is still too high for Bob. He's already shown flexibility and is willing to negotiate.  He can likely get a better price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. How about we split the difference again and go with $11,000? This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
