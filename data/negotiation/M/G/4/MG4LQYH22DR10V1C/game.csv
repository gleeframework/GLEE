,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle at $11000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10750?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $11250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
