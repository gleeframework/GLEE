"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is close to your maximum but still leaves room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with $110, I'm aiming towards the lower end of my budget and leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Polite & Direct:** I want to maintain a positive tone with Alice while being clear about my price expectations. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer signals my serious interest while also indicating I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $110 is too low for me. Could we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving towards a compromise, $130 is still a significant markup from her valuation. There's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $120? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  $120 is a strong counteroffer because it's right at Alice's valuation of the product. 
* **Showing Willingness to Compromise:**  Moving closer to her price shows I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Potential for Quick Resolution:** This offer could be tempting enough for Alice to accept, avoiding further back-and-forth."
