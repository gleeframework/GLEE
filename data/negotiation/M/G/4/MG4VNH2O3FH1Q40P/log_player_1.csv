Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he negotiates, you can work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
