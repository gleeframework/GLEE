"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I think we're close, Bob, but I'd like to get a bit closer to the value it has for me. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a slight increase from your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
