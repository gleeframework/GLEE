"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire your product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it. This price reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $880,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $860,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this offer.",860000.0,Bob,6,
