"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be open to considering that? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I have to consider my own minimum price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,
