"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be immensely valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and to reflect that more accurately, I propose a price of $875,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, what do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $875,000 is still a little steeper than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $787,500?  This price reflects the value I see in the product while acknowledging your need for a fair return.",787500.0,Bob,4,
