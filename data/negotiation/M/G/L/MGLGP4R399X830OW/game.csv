"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe the product will bring significant value to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a compromise we can both live with.",825000.0,Alice,5,
