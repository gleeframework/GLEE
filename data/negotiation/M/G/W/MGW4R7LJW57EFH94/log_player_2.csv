"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is way too high. It's much higher than your maximum budget and even higher than her own valuation. You should definitely counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with a lower offer. This leaves room for you to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within the realm of possibility. It will gauge how flexible she's willing to be. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** Remember, you can always buy from John for $100. This gives you leverage, as you don't *need* to reach an agreement with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $85 is a much better offer, it's still above your ideal price and your fallback option (John's price). 
* **Alice is Willing to Negotiate:** The fact that Alice countered means she's willing to negotiate. There's a good chance you can get the price lower.
* **Aim Closer to Your Goal:** You should aim for a price closer to $70-$75 before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That would work much better for me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($70) and Alice's counteroffer ($85). This is a common negotiation tactic and can signal your willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Firm:** While you're moving closer to her price, you're still holding firm below your $100 walk-away point. 
* **Testing the Bottom Line:** This offer will help you understand how much lower Alice is willing to go. If she rejects this, it might be time to consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob, but I still think I can do better than $75. How about we meet at $80? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $80 is a solid price, well below your $100 maximum and a significant savings from Alice's initial offer.
* **Limited Upside:** While you might be able to negotiate a few more dollars off, it's unlikely to be a significant amount.  Continuing the negotiation could risk Alice backing out.
* **Time Value:**  Sometimes it's better to accept a good offer than risk losing it by pushing for too much."
