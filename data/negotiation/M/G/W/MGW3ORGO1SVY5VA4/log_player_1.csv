{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000.  This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer yet, and I think I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference and meet in the middle at $875,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and it allows me to move closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 875000}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming to close the gap further."

Round 6

```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a significantly better offer from Bob. It's getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still a bit away. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $1,000,000. This ensures I get the best possible value for the product."
