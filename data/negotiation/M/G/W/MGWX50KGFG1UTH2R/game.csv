"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand it's lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise.  I'm open to selling for $1750000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1300000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1600000 as a final offer. This is a significant discount from my original price, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns about the value of the product, Alice, but $1600000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
