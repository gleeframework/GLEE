"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob and make him feel valued.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's uniqueness and value to pique Bob's interest.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll need to adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll need to determine if his counteroffer is worth pursuing or if it's better to move on to John. 
* **Rounds:**  I have 10 rounds to close the deal, so I'll need to be strategic about how I negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's too low to accept at this stage.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Value:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling the product for less than its minimum value to me.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get a higher price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand it's lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise.  I'm open to selling for $1,750,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a price lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and justifying the price.
* **Openness to Discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum while still being attractive to Bob. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000, so this counteroffer keeps me within my acceptable range.
* **Building Momentum:**  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and could encourage Bob to raise his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's not worth accepting at this point.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Value:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling the product for less than its minimum value to me.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I'm not sure if Bob is genuinely interested in the product, but rejecting his offer gives me an opportunity to potentially get a higher price or even discourage him from continuing the negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 as a final offer. This is a significant discount from my original price, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm stating a firm price that's closer to my minimum but still represents a compromise. 
* **Final Offer:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth while acknowledging his budget constraints.

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm narrowing the price gap to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Pushing for a Decision:**  I want to get Bob to make a decision and avoid further rounds of negotiation that could lead to a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the value of the product, Alice, but $1600000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's clear that Bob's budget is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept, and further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a successful outcome.  I'm opting to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is my minimum price and a guaranteed sale.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are already in round 6, and further negotiation with Bob might not yield a better offer.
* **Avoiding Stalemate:**  Bob's persistent low offers suggest that we're headed for a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John is the most secure way to ensure a sale above my minimum acceptable price."
