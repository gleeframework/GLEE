"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $850,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Could we possibly agree on $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $825,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting closer!  I appreciate the concessions you've made so far.  How about we settle right in the middle at $800,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal! However, I'm not quite willing to meet you at $800,000. I can offer you a price of $825,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",825000.0,Alice,7,
