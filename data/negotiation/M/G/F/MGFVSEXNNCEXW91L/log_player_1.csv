"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to get a good deal. I'll be willing to negotiate, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still keep it above Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will incentivize him to accept and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $110 is a good deal considering the time we've spent negotiating and the risk of going back and forth further."
