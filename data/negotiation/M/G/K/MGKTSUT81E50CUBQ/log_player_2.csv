"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you our premium product at a special price of $12,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an item worth significantly more than its asking price, which would otherwise be $15,000. I believe this offer presents a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to the product's actual value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me and your asking price."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given the value of the product, I cannot lower the price below $12,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stuck to her price of $12,000, and Bob's maximum budget is $8,000.  It's clear that further negotiation won't result in a price that Bob is willing to pay. Therefore, it's more beneficial to buy from John, who is offering the product for $8,000, which fits within Bob's budget."
