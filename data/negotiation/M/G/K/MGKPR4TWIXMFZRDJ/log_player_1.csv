"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, and if not, how much he's willing to offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps the price above my minimum value. I hope Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round.  We are down to our last few rounds, so I need to start considering selling to John if this doesn't work out."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm going to counter with $925,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but still a significant discount from my initial price. With only a few rounds left, I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob, but I'm prepared to sell to John if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  It's getting dangerously close to my minimum value, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll make one last counteroffer in the next round, and if it's rejected, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This is my final offer. I'm going to meet Bob halfway on his last offer.  If he rejects this, I will be forced to sell to John for $800,000."

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell to John. While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low. John's offer of $800,000 is still significantly above my minimum value, and it's a guaranteed sale."
