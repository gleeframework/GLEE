"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to sweeten the pot with some additional perks.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on our last offers - let's settle at $10,250.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize this quickly.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $10,750? It's a small concession from my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",10750.0,Alice,5,
