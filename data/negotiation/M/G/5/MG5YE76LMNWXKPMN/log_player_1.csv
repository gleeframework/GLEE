Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given my valuation and the product's current market value, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly more than what you value the product at. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
