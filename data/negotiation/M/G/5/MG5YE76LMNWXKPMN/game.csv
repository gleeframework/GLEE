"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given my valuation and the product's current market value, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly more than what you value the product at. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $950,000 is a respectable offer, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer still allows you a significant return on investment while reflecting the value I'm placing on it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a bit lower. I'm happy to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This would still be a very profitable deal for you, and I'm confident it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
