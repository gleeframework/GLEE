"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work.  Let's find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $11,500 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm running out of time here, and I really want to make this deal work. Let's split the difference.  I'll accept $10,800 for the product. This is my final offer.  What do you say?",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $10,200, so I'll offer $10,400. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",10400.0,Bob,8,
