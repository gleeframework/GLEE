"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you've been interested in. My asking price is $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a better price than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $120?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $130?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $130 is still within Bob's budget of $150 and significantly better than John's offer of $150.
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away or counter with a higher price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the product to another buyer or wasting time, which could be spent finding other products.

Overall, accepting Alice's offer at $130 is the most sensible choice, balancing value with the risk of losing the product or spending more."
