{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is higher than your minimum value of $120, so you're making a profit.
* **It's within Bob's range:** $115 is still within Bob's value range of $100, making it potentially acceptable to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can still potentially negotiate down to a price closer to Bob's value, or up if you believe Bob is willing to pay more. 

This strategy allows you to maximize your chances of selling to Bob while also giving you leverage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While selling to Bob for $100 would be better than nothing, it's still below your minimum desired price of $120. It's also worth considering that John is willing to pay $120, so there's no rush to accept Bob's offer.  

You can likely get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. You have room to negotiate a price closer to your minimum while still keeping Bob in the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a little, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to sell it to you for $110. That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer balances a few things:

* **Moving closer to Bob's price:** $110 is closer to Bob's $100 offer, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **Staying above your minimum:**  $110 is still above your minimum price of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:** This price leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant. 

By making this counteroffer, you show flexibility while maintaining a profitable position."
