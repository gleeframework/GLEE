Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving me significant bargaining power.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I could start higher, offering $1,300,000 leaves room for some negotiation (if Bob tries to counter-offer) while still securing a significant profit above my minimum.
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer.  By pricing at $1,300,000, I secure a healthy $300,000 profit over my guaranteed sale to John.  This balances maximizing my potential profit with the certainty of a sale."
