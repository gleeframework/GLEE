"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is lower than Bob's maximum budget, so rejecting and counter-offering is a good strategy.  Bob can likely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000? "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price point, but it's getting closer. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $9,000 is still a little out of my budget.  How about $8,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to purchase the product without breaking the bank. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8500 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $8750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. Bob can get the product for a reasonable price, saving $3,250 compared to buying from John.  It's likely that further negotiation would only result in small price reductions, so accepting is the best option."
