"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge from his price, and I've already lost two rounds trying to negotiate. It's getting risky to keep going as I'm running out of rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired value, so that's the safer choice."
