I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value. This allows some room for negotiation, while still ensuring I make more than my minimum target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}

I'm offering a price that's in the middle of my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I'll get the same price from John."
