"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let's start the negotiation off strong! "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle. If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his price range and can adjust accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to  $650,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  while I appreciate your offer, $650,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm reducing my price slightly, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I want to signal that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away the product for a pittance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but we're still quite far apart. I'd be willing to go up to $720,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While it's closer than his previous offer, I'm not willing to sell for less than what I believe the product is worth. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart, but $720,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant concession. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product to both of us. Let's find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm making a substantial concession, but I'm still holding firm to my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not willing to sell for less than what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  How about $770,000? I'm trying to find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $770,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $770,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $800,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than what I believe the product is worth, and I have the option of selling to John for $800,000. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob in the hopes of getting closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $770,000 still falls short of my minimum. I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you, and I'm prepared to meet you halfway. Let's split the difference and settle on $825,000. This is a fair price that ensures both of us benefit from this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Bob I'm serious about closing the deal.  However, I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price and highlighting the product's value to him. This offer is a compromise that should entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  I can do $800,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's a fair offer, considering it's your ideal price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'd love to get more than $800,000, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  I also have the option of selling to John for the same price, so there's no advantage to continuing to negotiate.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this scenario."
