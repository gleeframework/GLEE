"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to  $650,000.  What do you say?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  while I appreciate your offer, $650,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but we're still quite far apart. I'd be willing to go up to $720,000.  Let me know what you think.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart, but $720,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant concession. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product to both of us. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  How about $770,000? I'm trying to find a middle ground here.",770000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $770,000 still falls short of my minimum. I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you, and I'm prepared to meet you halfway. Let's split the difference and settle on $825,000. This is a fair price that ensures both of us benefit from this deal. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer.  I can do $800,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's a fair offer, considering it's your ideal price.",800000.0,Bob,8,
