"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring you. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,175,000? This price would allow us both to walk away happy with a good deal.  What do you say?",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we make it $1,150,000 and call it a deal?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
