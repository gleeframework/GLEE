"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product. Considering its value to you, we propose a price of $950,000 for it. We believe this offers a fair compromise between its worth to you and our valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high.  It's worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice values it at $800,000.  There's significant room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering your valuation and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, we've decided to counter with a price of $900,000 for the product. This reflects a midpoint between our initial proposal and your revised offer, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is a slight improvement, it's still above the midpoint of our valuations.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $850,000.  There are still rounds left and no need to rush into a deal that's not quite right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still not there yet.  I'm firm on my offer of $850,000, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: After careful consideration, we have decided to counter your offer with a price of $875,000 for the product. This is an attempt to bridge the gap between our previous offers and find a satisfactory solution for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within my acceptable range and a good compromise. While I'd prefer to pay $850,000, this is close enough, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing too hard.  It's time to close the deal and avoid going through John, who is significantly more expensive."
