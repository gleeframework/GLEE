"I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not quite comfortable with $75, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but $105 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to do it for $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $80, Bob. However, I'm still not getting the price I want. I'll make one more counteroffer. How about $115?",115.0,Alice,7,
