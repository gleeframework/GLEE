"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This reflects a fair value for both of us, considering your cost and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects a fair value for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
