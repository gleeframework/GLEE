"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You can definitely get a better price than $900,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects a fair value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's still well below his maximum budget of $1,200,000, and it's closer to his initial counteroffer of $750,000. It's a win-win situation for both parties."
