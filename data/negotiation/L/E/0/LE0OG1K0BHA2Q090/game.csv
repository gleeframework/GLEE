"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $1200000? ",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $1350000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm closer to your price now, $1350000 is still a bit higher than I can go. I'm ready to close the deal if you come down to $1300000. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1300000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to try to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1320000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
