You're getting closer! But Alice's offer is still higher than what you'd pay John.  Since you only have 3 rounds left, you need to start considering the possibility of buying from John.  Keep trying to negotiate with Alice, but if she doesn't come down to a lower price, buying from John might be your best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

This is your last chance to get a better deal from Alice. If she rejects this offer, you'll have to decide between buying from John or accepting her next offer (if it's better)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and this is your last chance to make a counteroffer. You've already rejected several of her offers, and she doesn't seem willing to go lower. It's better to buy the product from John at $15,000. While it's not the lowest price, it guarantees you get the product and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting your final counteroffer."
