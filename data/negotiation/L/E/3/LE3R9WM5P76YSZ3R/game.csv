"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $100?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $100 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $95?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $92.50. I'm confident we can close this deal at that price.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $92.50, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $97.50?",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $97.50 is still a bit high.  How about we settle at $94?  That's a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",94.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $96, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can make a deal.",96.0,Alice,7,
