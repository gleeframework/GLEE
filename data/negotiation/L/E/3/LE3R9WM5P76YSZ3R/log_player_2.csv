"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the offer. You can get the product for a better price than $100. You're willing to pay $120 at the absolute maximum, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $100 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still within your price range, and Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate. There's a chance you can get the product for even less than $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $92.50. I'm confident we can close this deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you at $92.50, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $97.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still close to your target price, and Alice has shown flexibility. You can likely get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $97.50 is still a bit high.  How about we settle at $94?  That's a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 94}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $96, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $96
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could try to negotiate further, you've come very close to your maximum price.  It's likely Alice is firm on her offer and you risk losing the deal if you reject it.  Accepting her offer at $96 will still give you a good deal and save you $24 compared to buying from John."
