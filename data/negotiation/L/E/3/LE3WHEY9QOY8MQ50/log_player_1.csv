Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. By offering $100, I'm aiming for a decent profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'll be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response and the potential value of the product to him.  I'm also being friendly and engaging to create a positive negotiating atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than $80, I believe there is still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand $100 might be a bit high.  How about we split the difference?  $95 is my final offer. If you're not interested at that price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we meet at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and $92.50 is a good price that is close to my desired value.  It's more than what John is offering and still leaves me a decent profit margin. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
