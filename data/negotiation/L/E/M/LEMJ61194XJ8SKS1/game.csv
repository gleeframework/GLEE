"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done my research and understand its worth to you is $1500000. However, I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1200000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
