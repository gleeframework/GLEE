Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a faster sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $950,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but it leaves him with a potential profit margin should he choose to leverage the product's value in other ways.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as beneficial for Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
