"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value beyond the current market, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product's value.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,090,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end, demonstrating my willingness to close this deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think that's a fair price for the product's value and my budget.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
