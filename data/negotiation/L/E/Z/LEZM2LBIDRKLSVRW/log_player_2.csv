{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While the product is worth $100 to me, Alice's offer of $95 is still too high. I want to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $100 for me, but $95 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 85}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
