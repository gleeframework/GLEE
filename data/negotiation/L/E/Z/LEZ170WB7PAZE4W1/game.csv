"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than I initially offered, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
