"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only justify paying around $50 for it.",50.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $50 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  However, $70 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $85? That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal. Let's make this happen!",85.0,Alice,5,
