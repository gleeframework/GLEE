"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. Considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
