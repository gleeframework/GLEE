Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we both can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $125 is a good price and is worth the time and effort of continuing to negotiate.  I'm also aware that I could always sell to John for $120, so this is a win for me."
