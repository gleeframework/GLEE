Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $12,000, starting significantly higher gives room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit for Alice. 
* **John as a backup:** The presence of John, willing to buy at Bob's valuation, provides a safety net.  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The message hints at potential flexibility by asking Bob if he's ""interested"" rather than demanding a firm yes or no. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while still giving Bob a chance to make a deal he finds acceptable."
