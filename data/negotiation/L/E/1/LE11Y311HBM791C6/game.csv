"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9,500 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still very confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,800. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $8,800 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to settle around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the price down, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to make a deal but $8,200 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and close the deal at $7,850?",7850.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $7,850. I'm going to make a small counteroffer: $8,100. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,7,
