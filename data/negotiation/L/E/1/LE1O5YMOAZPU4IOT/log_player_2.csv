Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get it lower. I think there's room for further negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm closer to your price now,  I'm still hoping to find a solution closer to $825,000. This price would allow both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're a serious buyer, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to be at least at $845,000 to make this deal work for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $845,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $845,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now close to my desired price point.  I've successfully negotiated down from $900,000 to $845,000. Accepting this offer will save me $155,000 compared to buying from John.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal is increasing, and the potential savings are smaller."
