"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm closer to your price now,  I'm still hoping to find a solution closer to $825,000. This price would allow both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're a serious buyer, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to be at least at $845,000 to make this deal work for me. What do you think?",845000.0,Alice,5,
