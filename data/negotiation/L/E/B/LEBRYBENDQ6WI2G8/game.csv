"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm thinking of a price of $12000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is there any wiggle room in your price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $10000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $9500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about other interested buyers, so this is my final offer on this price point. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've made a big concession already, Bob, and I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I'm going to try one more time to get a fair price. I can do $9200, but that's my absolute last offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options. What do you say?",9200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you've made some concessions, but I'm still not willing to go above $9000. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but no higher. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made several concessions already, and I'm starting to lose patience. I'm not going to go any lower than $9500, and that's a stretch for me. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options. This is my final offer. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go above $9000, and you've made it clear that you won't go below $9500. I think we've reached an impasse. I'm willing to walk away from this deal and buy the product from John for $8000. I think it's time to end the negotiation.",9000.0,Bob,10,
