"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,500,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from $1,650,000. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your willingness to negotiate, $1,550,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to finalize this deal. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
