While $900,000 is still lower than your ideal price, it's closer to your minimum.  Since Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, it's likely he won't budge much further.  Accepting the offer ensures you receive a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely or you having to settle for John's lower offer."
