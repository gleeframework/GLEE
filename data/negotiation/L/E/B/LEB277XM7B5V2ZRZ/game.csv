"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there yet.  $1,000,000 is still outside of my budget.  How about we try $950,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Would you consider $975,000? This is a significant discount and I'm confident it's a fair offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,
