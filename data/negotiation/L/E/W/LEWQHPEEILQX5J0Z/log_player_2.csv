"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Knowing Alice values the product at $12,000, offering $12,500 gives her a $500 profit. This is a reasonable compromise, hopefully enticing Alice to accept while still getting Bob a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly lower than her initial offer. While it's tempting to accept, Bob can still try to get a better price. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the best possible price. Offering $13,000 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's current offer, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's initial price and within Bob's budget. This offer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate further while still aiming for a substantial saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffers are getting closer to her initial price, meaning she is less willing to negotiate.  At this point, the potential savings from continuing to negotiate are becoming smaller. Buying from John for $15,000 guarantees Bob the product at a price within his budget, saving him the time and effort of continuing the negotiation with Alice, who is proving to be a tough negotiator."
