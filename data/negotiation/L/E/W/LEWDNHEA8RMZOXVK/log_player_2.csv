"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There are 9 rounds left, so I have time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to get Alice closer to my budget.  $900,000 is still a decent amount, but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to gauge her willingness to compromise before resorting to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe the product's value is worth more than that, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, $1,050,000 is still over my budget.  I'm willing to keep negotiating.  John's offer is still a fallback option, but I'm not going to rush into that yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm going to counter with $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my financial limitations."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with a counteroffer, but raising my bid slightly from the previous round. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also trying to get Alice closer to my desired price. I'm aiming for a gradual negotiation, hoping for a middle ground by the end."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my budget, but she is getting closer. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as we are close to a mutually beneficial deal.  John's offer is still an option, but I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer.  I'm going to counter with $1,000,000.  This is my absolute limit, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making my final push to reach my budget.  I'm offering the maximum I'm willing to pay, hoping Alice will accept and avoid going to John.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but I'm not willing to go any higher.  If Alice rejects, I'll likely move to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that I'm getting the best deal possible. I'm counteroffering at $1,007,500. Let's see if we can push the needle a bit further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,007,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,007,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is only willing to come down to $1,007,500. This is still above my budget, and we're running out of time.  With only three rounds left, it's not likely I'll be able to get her to accept my price.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's the most sensible option at this point."
