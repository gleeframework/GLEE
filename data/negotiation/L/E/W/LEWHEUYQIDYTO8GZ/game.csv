"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at that price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1100000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me, and I'm still confident you'll love it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from the $1100000. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's the highest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your honesty about your maximum price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
