Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob might accept $119, there's a chance he might counter-offer. Starting slightly higher allows room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $120 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you don't lose out. 

**Important:** This is just one approach.  Depending on your sales style and knowledge about Bob, you might choose a different opening price."
