"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm still looking for something a bit closer to $1,000,000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $925,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a bit off. How about we split the difference again and go with $937,500?  That feels like a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy.",937500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but $937,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think we can meet at $920,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",920000.0,Bob,6,
