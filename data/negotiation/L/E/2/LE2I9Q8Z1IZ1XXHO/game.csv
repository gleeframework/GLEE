"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $10,750? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value at that price.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $10,500? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
