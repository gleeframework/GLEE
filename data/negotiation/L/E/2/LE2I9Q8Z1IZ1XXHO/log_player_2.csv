"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it for $11,500.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better deal than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $10,750? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $10,750 is a good price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives Bob more control over the negotiation and the potential to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $10,500? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
