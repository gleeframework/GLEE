Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $12,000. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's valuation is significantly lower than yours and John's. By offering it at $12,000, you can gauge his interest. If he accepts, you get a great deal. If he negotiates down, you can still likely settle for a price higher than $10,000.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, which provides a safety net. This means you don't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while minimizing risk."
