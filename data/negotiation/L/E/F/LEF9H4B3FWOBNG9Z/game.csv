"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you consider that price?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is your maximum price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I've already invested a lot in the product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $85, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
