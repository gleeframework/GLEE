Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, and it's likely he won't go much higher. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
