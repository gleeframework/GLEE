"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $15,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price to make it work for me.  How about $10,000? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range that reflects the product's value to you. This allows for room to bargain further if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $12,500? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum limit of $12,000.  By rejecting this offer, you can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a lower price.  There's still room to bargain, and the option to buy from John provides a safety net if you don't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $11,500, which I believe is a fair compromise. This would allow both of us to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to push for a lower price, but it's a smaller step down from Alice's previous offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise and reach a deal while still staying within your budget constraints. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about this deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I can go. It's the lowest price I can offer and still make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is now at your maximum budget. This is a good deal for you, as it allows you to acquire the product without exceeding your limit.  Although you could continue negotiating and potentially try to get a slightly lower price, there's no guarantee of success, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy the product. 

Given the risk of continuing negotiation and the fact that you have a backup option with John, it's the most sensible choice to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at your desired price."
