"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $15,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price to make it work for me.  How about $10,000? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $12,500? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $11,500, which I believe is a fair compromise. This would allow both of us to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about this deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I can go. It's the lowest price I can offer and still make a profit. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
