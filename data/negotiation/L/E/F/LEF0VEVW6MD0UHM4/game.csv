"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $650,000 is below what I need, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $750,000? This reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. ",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm getting closer to a price point I can make work.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $725,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, and I respect your position. However, to be honest, $725,000 is pushing the limits of my budget. I could potentially do $710,000, but that's really the best I can offer.",710000.0,Bob,6,
