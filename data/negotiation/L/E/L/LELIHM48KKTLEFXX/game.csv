"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I can meet you halfway, though. My revised offer is: $800,000 is the minimum I can do, but I'm willing to give you a slight discount. I'll sell it to you for $795,000. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,3,
