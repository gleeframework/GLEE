# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose selling the product to you for $140. This allows us both to benefit from the transaction, with you getting a high-quality item at a reasonable price and me securing a profit. Please let me know if this offer suits you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

Alice's offer of $140 is less than your maximum price of $150 and also saves you money compared to buying from John for $150."
