,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I can meet you halfway at $8,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,250. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll meet you at $8,750. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",8750.0,Alice,5,
