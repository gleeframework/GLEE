"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product, and I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make it yours for $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  Maintaining a good tone is important in negotiations. I'm expressing my interest while also being clear about my budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a living too. I can meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $10,500 for the product. Can we discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down slightly, but she's still closer to her desired price. I'll reject this offer to signal I'm looking for a more significant discount. I'm willing to push the negotiation a bit further, but I'll keep John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $9,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a price that's roughly halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and move closer to a deal.
* **Confidence:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair compromise,"" projecting confidence that this is a good deal for both parties. 
* **Time Consideration:**  As the rounds progress, I need to keep in mind that I have a limited time to reach an agreement with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure $9,750 is a fair compromise for me, considering the product's value. I can do $10,250, but that's as low as I can go. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, and it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better deal.
* **Time Value:**  We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds. Continuing to haggle might not be worth the potential savings, especially considering John's offer. 
* **Acceptable Price:**  $10,250 is a reasonable price, saving me $1,750 off John's offer and $750 off Alice's initial offer."
