,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price.  How about $1,050,000?  This reflects the significant value the product holds for you. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. How about $975,000? That's the best I can do.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll be happy with in the long run. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Alice, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, this time between $975,000 and $1,025,000. How about $1,000,000? That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
