"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This product is truly valuable and I believe it's a fair price.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm seeing some movement here which is good, but we're still a ways off. $9,500 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping for. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
