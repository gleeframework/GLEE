Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 reflects its true worth, I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair offer considering the value you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 13500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $12,750. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from selling it to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for more, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we're getting close enough to my desired profit margin. It's better to secure the deal at $12,750 than risk him walking away and potentially getting only $10,000 from John."
