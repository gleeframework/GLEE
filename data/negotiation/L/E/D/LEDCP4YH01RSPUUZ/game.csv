"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $17,000 is still too far from what I can afford.  Would you consider $9,500? I think that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I'm seeing we're getting closer. To make this work, I can go down to $15,500. This is a significant reduction on my end and reflects my willingness to close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  That's getting closer to a price I can afford.  Could you do $11,000?  That would allow me to accept and close this deal today.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our prices is still substantial.  My final offer is $14,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's value. Let me know your decision.",14000.0,Alice,7,
