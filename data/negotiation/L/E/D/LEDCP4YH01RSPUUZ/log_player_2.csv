Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our prices is still substantial.  My final offer is $14,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's value. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

``` 

It's time to switch to John.  Alice is unlikely to come down significantly, and it's not worth risking paying more than you need to. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no need to negotiate further with Alice."
