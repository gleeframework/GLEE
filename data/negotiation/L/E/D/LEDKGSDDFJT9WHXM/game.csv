"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $8,000.  Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers a lot of value, and I think a fair price would be closer to $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $18,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could we possibly agree on $9,500? That's a significant increase from my previous offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I'm motivated to sell, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $16,000? That's a compromise I'm willing to make.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offers.  How about $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. Let's make this happen.  What if we settled on $14,500? That's my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you say that's your final offer, but I'm on a tight budget.  I can go as high as $11,000. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",11000.0,Bob,8,
