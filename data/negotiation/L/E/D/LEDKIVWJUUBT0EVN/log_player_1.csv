Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's valuation, giving me room to potentially negotiate down if necessary. It also expresses confidence in the product's value, which may persuade Bob to accept.  However, I'm also prepared to potentially counteroffer or sell to John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. I'll need to be strategic, but I'm confident I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, and I'm offering you the product for $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good outcome for me, considering I could sell to John for the same amount.  While I'd prefer a bit more, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely."
