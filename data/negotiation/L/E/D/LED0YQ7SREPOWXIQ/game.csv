"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,100,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm willing to accept $950,000 for the product. This would allow me to recoup some of my initial investment and still give you a great deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
