I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price.  I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product. Hopefully, this will entice him to accept."

Bob is firm on his $12,000 offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I've already made a compromise in the previous round, and I'm not confident I can push for a higher price.  It's best to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation."
