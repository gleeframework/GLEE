"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $900,000 is a bit below my target, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm confident this product is worth more to you than that, and I'm prepared to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a successful transaction. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
