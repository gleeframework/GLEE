"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a bit more. ",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That way we both get a good deal. ",90.0,Bob,4,
