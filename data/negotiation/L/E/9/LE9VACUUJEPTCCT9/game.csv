"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a middle ground, but I have to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us both in the deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, and I'm trying to meet you halfway.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not going to budge any further. This is the best I can do. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
