Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to push the price down further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $800,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $800000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $825000. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is getting very close to my desired price point.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she'll become unwilling to budge further, or that I might waste more rounds and end up having to buy from John for the full $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price, saving me a significant amount compared to buying from John."
