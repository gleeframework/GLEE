"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial offer is $1,200,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, it's still a significant drop from my desired price point. I believe I can get closer to my desired value by counter-offering and continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is tempting, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the significant value this product brings to you, and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $950,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is close to my desired range, I still have a few rounds left and believe I can push for a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position.  While $950,000 is closer, we're still a bit apart. Let's split the difference.  How about $975,000? This reflects the value you'll gain from the product while ensuring a good outcome for me.  I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
