"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the enthusiasm behind the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $20000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 is a significant discount from my original price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline the current offer of $18000. My budget allows me to spend up to $8000 for this product. I would like to make a final counteroffer of $16000, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $17000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,5,
