"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my research and the market value of this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the potential value we both see in this opportunity.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the valuation. However,  the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer takes into account the unique benefits this product offers and provides a fair deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you moving closer, $1,800,000 is still outside my price range.  Considering the market value and my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to accept $1,500,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept while still honoring the value of this product.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
