"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great investment for you. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. This is a significant discount considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer.  However, $850,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
