"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $11,000?  I think that would be a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your feedback. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,500 is getting closer, but it's still a bit high for my budget.  How about $11,800?",11800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. $11,800 is still a bit low for me. What if we settled on $12,100? That's a very competitive price for this kind of value.",12100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for being so patient with me.  I'm ready to close this deal, but I need you to come down a bit more. Would you be willing to do $12,000 even?",12000.0,Bob,6,
