"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $13,000. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is less than the $15,000 John is asking, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $11,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $11,000 is a tempting offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial price.  Would you consider $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  $12,000 is still within Bob's budget and saves him $3,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting and continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but also the risk of Alice walking away or needing to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting locks in a good deal."
