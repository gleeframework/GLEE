"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is closer to the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $15,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my initial offer of $12,000.  I hope you understand.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I'm confident this product is worth a good investment. I'm willing to come down slightly to $14,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you think the product is valuable, and I do too.  But $14,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to pay $13,000, and I believe that's a fair price given the value we both see in the product.  Let's find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,6,
