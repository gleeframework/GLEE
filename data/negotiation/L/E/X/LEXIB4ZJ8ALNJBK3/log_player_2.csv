"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's $6,000 over your maximum budget. It's best to reject the offer and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is closer to the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still $3,000 higher than my maximum budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $15,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my initial offer of $12,000.  I hope you understand."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I'm confident this product is worth a good investment. I'm willing to come down slightly to $14,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still $2,000 above my budget. I'm still holding out for a better price, and I'm willing to risk rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate.  At this point, it's a gamble. I could potentially get a better price, but I could also lose the opportunity entirely if Alice decides to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you think the product is valuable, and I do too.  But $14,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to pay $13,000, and I believe that's a fair price given the value we both see in the product.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
