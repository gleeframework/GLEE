"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $750,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product holds for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
