"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1400000.  It's a great opportunity for you, and I believe it's fair considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1100000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $1250000? This would still allow you to make a good profit and would be a fair price for me.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down from $1400000 to $1250000, but I still think that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1200000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
