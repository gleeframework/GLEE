"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than my asking price and still leaves you with a substantial profit margin.  Let me know your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can you consider my counteroffer?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $875,000. Can you consider my revised counteroffer?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we may not be able to reach an agreement. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $890,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know your final decision.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $890,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $880,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",880000.0,Bob,6,
