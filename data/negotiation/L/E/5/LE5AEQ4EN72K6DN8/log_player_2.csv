"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $9,500 is too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  That's still a great deal for you considering the value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, which is good, but we can still try to negotiate further.  Splitting the difference again will get us closer to our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $7,000 might be a bit low, Alice.  To meet you halfway, how about $7,600?"", 
""product_price"": 7600
}
```

We are moving closer to Alice's price, demonstrating our willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly lower than our maximum budget."
