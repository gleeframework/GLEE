Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $800,000. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price given our shared understanding of the product's worth. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value we've discussed, I'm willing to offer $725,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.  Let's find common ground.
