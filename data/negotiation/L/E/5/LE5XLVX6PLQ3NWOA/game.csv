"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $800,000. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price given our shared understanding of the product's worth. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $750,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value you'll get from the product.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value we've discussed, I'm willing to offer $725,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.  Let's find common ground.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $740,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value you'll get from the product.",740000.0,Alice,5,
