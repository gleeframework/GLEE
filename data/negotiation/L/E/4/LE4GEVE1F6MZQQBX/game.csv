"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, however,  $900,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your perspective.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm feeling like we're getting closer. To show you I'm serious, I'll bump my offer to $1,000,000 even. This is a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
