Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I believe it will be very valuable for you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even slightly more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your minimum acceptable price and leaves room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit than selling to John.
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes value and a ""special price"" to make the offer more enticing to Bob."
