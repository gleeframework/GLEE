{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's split the difference and make a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to stick to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While I would prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  John is offering a guaranteed $100, which is a safe and reliable option.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
