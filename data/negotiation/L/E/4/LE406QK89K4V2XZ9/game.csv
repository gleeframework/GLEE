"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be happy to buy it for $125. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? This would be a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
