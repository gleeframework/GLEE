"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $95?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50?  I'm confident you'll still find this a great value.",102.5,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $97.50 as a compromise. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product.",97.5,Bob,4,
