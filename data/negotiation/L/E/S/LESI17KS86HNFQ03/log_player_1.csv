{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above my minimum value of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation to potentially reach a price closer to Bob's value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll come down to $11,000? That's a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
