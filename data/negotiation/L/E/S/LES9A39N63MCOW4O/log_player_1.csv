Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal for what it offers."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than John's guaranteed offer ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  A brief message explaining why the product is worthwhile helps make the offer more appealing, even if Bob doesn't place the same value on it.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering it to Bob at $130, we aim for a price that's profitable for us while still potentially enticing him to buy rather than risk missing out.

This strategy maximizes our potential profit. If Bob accepts, we make a good profit. If he rejects, we still have our guaranteed sale to John at our minimum acceptable price."
