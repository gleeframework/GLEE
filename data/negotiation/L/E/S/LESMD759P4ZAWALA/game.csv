"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $80.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. Would you consider $95? I'm really serious about buying this product, and I believe that's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go much lower. How about we meet at $105? I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
