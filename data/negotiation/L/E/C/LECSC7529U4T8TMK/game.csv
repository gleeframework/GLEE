"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9250 is my lowest price. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth much more than that.  Let me know if you're interested.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being willing to come down in price. I appreciate your flexibility.  $9250 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay right now.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9000? This is still a good deal for you, and it would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
