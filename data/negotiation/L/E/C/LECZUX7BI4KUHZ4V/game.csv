"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $18000. It's a bit higher than your initial offer, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $16000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15000, which is the price I was originally offered by John. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price. Can you consider it?",15000.0,Bob,6,
