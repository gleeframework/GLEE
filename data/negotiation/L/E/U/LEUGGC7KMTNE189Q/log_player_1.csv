Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to you, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming high initially allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much higher profit than selling to John. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and ensuring the deal is still attractive enough for Bob to accept."
