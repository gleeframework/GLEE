"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $11,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I might need to look at other options.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  I'm firm on this price, but I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $10,750 is still a touch higher than I'd like.  Would you consider $10,600?  That's a firm offer from me.",10600.0,Bob,6,
