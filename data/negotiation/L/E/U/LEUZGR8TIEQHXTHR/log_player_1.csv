Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $11,500.  I'll see if I can get him to budge a bit in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm still very interested in the product. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm hoping to get just a little bit more. I'm still confident that I can get a better price, so I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  I'm firm on this price, but I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $10,750 is still a touch higher than I'd like.  Would you consider $10,600?  That's a firm offer from me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my target, and I'm running out of rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to settle for John's offer."
