"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to my asking price.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",137.5,Bob,4,
