"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $1200000 is still not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to be flexible and offer a final price of $1300000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to go up to $1280000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope you can meet me at this price.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
