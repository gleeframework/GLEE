This offer is a starting point that balances my desire for a high price with the need to entice Bob.  It's above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, as it is below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I've lowered my price slightly, but I'm sticking close to my desired price. This offer is firm, and I am prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my previous offer.  While I am aware that John is a backup option, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $1,200,000 is still not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to be flexible and offer a final price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to go up to $1280000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope you can meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I've made several concessions, but we're not close enough for a deal. Selling to John is the best choice now as it ensures I reach my minimum acceptable price."
