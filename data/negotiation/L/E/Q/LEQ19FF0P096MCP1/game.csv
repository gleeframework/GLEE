"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be of great value to you. I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  However, that price point doesn't reflect the true value of the product. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm hoping we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value proposition of the product, but there's still a gap between our numbers. To bridge that, I'd be willing to go up to $950,000. Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite a ways apart. I need to be realistic about my bottom line, and I'm simply not willing to go below $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value this product brings.  Let me know if you're willing to work within this range, otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your position and your willingness to negotiate. I'm also feeling the pressure to find a solution.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000 even? This represents a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it happen if we can close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
