"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and benefits of the product to encourage Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message signals that I'm open to discussion and willing to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.  I can likely find a middle ground in future rounds.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I have John's guaranteed offer of $150, so I can afford to be firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** I'm starting at my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm framing it as a ""good deal for both of us"" to emphasize that I'm not just trying to maximize my profit.
* **Open to closing the deal:** I'm signaling a willingness to close the deal at this price, hoping to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm still looking to keep my spending within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:** Bob's offer is only a slight increase from the previous round. There's limited room for me to increase my price without losing the deal.
* **John's offer is a better option:** I have John's guaranteed offer of $150, which is a safer and more profitable choice than accepting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $130 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer while staying above my minimum price.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm again highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Last chance:**  I'm aiming to close the deal in this round. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still aiming to keep my expenses lower. Could we agree on $135 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $135 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still not a very profitable deal for me. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that Bob will continue to haggle, potentially dragging the negotiation further down in price.
* **John's offer is more attractive:**  I have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John, which is more profitable and eliminates the risk of further negotiations. It's time to secure a better outcome for myself."
