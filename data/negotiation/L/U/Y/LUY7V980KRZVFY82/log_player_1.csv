Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to sell to John, I'm going to see if I can get a better deal from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500,  This is a significant discount, and a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm going to see if I can push Bob a little further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and agree on $10,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids any further back and forth. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
