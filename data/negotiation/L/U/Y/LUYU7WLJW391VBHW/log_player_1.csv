"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob. I'll adjust based on his response and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$80 is far too low for me. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. It's still a decent profit for me, but it's a significant step closer to my desired price and hopefully something Bob will find more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I will continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm sticking with a counteroffer of $160. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a small step down from my previous offer, making it seem more reasonable for Bob while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $150. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident Bob will be more likely to accept it than to risk losing the deal altogether.  If he rejects it, I'll sell to John, which will at least ensure I meet my minimum goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my minimum acceptable price with Bob, but he is refusing to go any higher.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150. This guarantees I get my minimum desired value and avoids further rounds of potentially fruitless negotiation."
