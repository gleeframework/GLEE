"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice's offer is exactly at your limit.  Since you have the option of buying from John at the same price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows for the possibility of a better price if you negotiate with John."
