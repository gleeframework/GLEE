"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better price. Rejecting allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially secure a deal closer to his desired price point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $925,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still beneficial for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer again and potentially secure a deal even closer to his target price of $850,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $887,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $915,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is $915,000. While Bob might want to push for a lower price, it's likely that continued negotiation will only result in Alice rejecting further offers. Additionally, Alice's offer is still significantly lower than what Bob would pay from John ($1,200,000). Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice in this situation.  It secures a good deal for Bob while minimizing the risk of losing the product to John."
