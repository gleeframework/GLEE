"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I get a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that balances both our interests.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
