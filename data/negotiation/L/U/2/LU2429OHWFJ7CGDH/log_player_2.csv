Round 9
Alice's offer:

I'm willing to meet you at $14,250, but I'd like to add a condition: I'll throw in some additional services and support worth $500. This way, you'll get an even better deal.

Alice is clearly not budging below $14,500.  While the additional services might hold *some* value, it's unlikely to be worth the extra $500 over John's offer.  It's time to cut bait and secure the product from John at the original budget limit."
