You have three options:

 You should reject Alice's offer.  You are aiming to pay no more than $80, and Alice's offer is too high. You can counteroffer at a lower price and try to negotiate a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're still aiming for a price closer to $80, and $100 is too high.  You can counteroffer again, trying to get closer to your target price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit too much for me. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product.  This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to spend, and hopefully, it works for you too."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $95 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to your target price, it's still over the $80 you're willing to pay. You've already rejected Alice's previous offers, and it seems like she's unwilling to budge much further. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
