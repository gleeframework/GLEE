"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I don't want to break the bank. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a great price for a product of this caliber.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,250,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is closer, but still below my minimum. To be fair to both of us, I can offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go. I'm confident you'll agree that it's a good deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go, so I'll have to reject this offer. However, I'm willing to walk away from this deal if we can't come to an agreement. If you're willing to reconsider, I'd be open to discussing a price of $1,280,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
