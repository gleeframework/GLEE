"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, close to what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price.  $120 is still below my minimum value for the product, and I have several rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to accept, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation if he needs more convincing."
