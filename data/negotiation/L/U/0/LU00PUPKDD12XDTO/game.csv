"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $105 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $110? Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure I can go that high. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? That's the closest I can get to your asking price while still staying within my budget.,107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm really hoping to get closer to $110.  Could we meet at $109?  It's just a dollar more than your last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not sure I can go up to $109. How about we meet at $108? That's as high as I'm willing to go.,108.0,Bob,6,
