{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy allows for negotiation and gives me a chance to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $105 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $110? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I can go that high. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? That's the closest I can get to your asking price while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $107.50 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer one more time, and see if we can get closer.  If he rejects again, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm really hoping to get closer to $110.  Could we meet at $109?  It's just a dollar more than your last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go up to $109. How about we meet at $108? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $108 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've already given Bob several chances to negotiate, and it seems like he's not willing to go any higher.  To ensure I get a price that meets my needs, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
