Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I think $110 is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, so any price below this will be profitable for him.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $110 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($10). This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Backup Option:** You have the security of John's offer ($80), ensuring you won't be left with no sale. 

By starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's maximum valuation, you maximize your chances of securing the best possible price."
