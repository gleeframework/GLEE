"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident it's a fair offer. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims the product is worth more, it's always wise to start negotiations by exploring if a lower price is possible.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, there's room to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you mentioning the potential value.  However, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to secure a significant discount while remaining reasonable. Offering $12,000 is a 20% reduction, showing Bob's seriousness about a deal while leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $13500?  This price still reflects the value I know this product holds.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit high for Bob.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice is willing to come down further.  There's still room for Bob to save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a better price. How about $13,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while giving you a decent return."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a gradual decrease in price, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.  $13,000 is a reasonable compromise that still offers him a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer and John's price."
