"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,000.  This reflects the value I know this product will bring you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so let me know if we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
