{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for potential counteroffers.  However, it's still significantly lower than the product's value to Bob, making it a tempting deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is only $5 less than my initial offer, and still a higher price than my minimum acceptable price. It's in my best interest to accept his offer and secure the sale."
