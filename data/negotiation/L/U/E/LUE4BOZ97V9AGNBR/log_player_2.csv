"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $115 is a good price, you can still potentially save money by counter-offering.  Alice is willing to sell for $100, so there's room for negotiation.  You can likely get the price down closer to your $120 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within your price range. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects your counteroffer."
