Alice's offer is way too high. It's best to reject and see if we can get a better price."

Let's start with a counteroffer at $600,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, and it's a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice's price is still too high.  It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to our target."

Let's try a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a  more reasonable price, considering John is selling for $800,000, and hopefully we can get Alice to budge a little more."

Alice is still asking for too much. We're close to our goal of $800,000.  It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if we can get her down to a price we're comfortable with."

Let's offer $850,000. This is only a little over John's price, and it's a good chance to see if we can close the deal with Alice.  We're getting close to our budget, and this is a good starting point for a final negotiation."

Alice's offer is still too high, and it's likely she won't budge further.  John is offering a fair price, and it's time to secure the product before we risk losing it."
