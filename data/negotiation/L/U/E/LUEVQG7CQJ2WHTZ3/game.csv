"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $17000. This is my final counteroffer.",17000.0,Alice,5,
