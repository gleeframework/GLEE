"I understand you're looking for a more competitive price, Bob. However, I've invested significant resources in this product, and I need to ensure I get a fair return. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you be open to discussing a price of $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $825,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you consider $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above my minimum value of $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725,000 and $825,000, which is $775,000. Is that a price you'd be comfortable with?",775000.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I've already mentioned that I'm willing to sell the product to John for $800,000, and I'm starting to think that might be the best option for me. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, but I need to be honest, I'm not getting any younger, and I'd rather not drag this out. Can we make a deal at $795,000?",795000.0,Alice,7,,
