"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product at a price that's significantly below its true value to you. I'm confident that this product will be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even exceeding the $1,500,000 you've estimated.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,250,000. This is a chance to secure a valuable asset at a remarkable price.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,1,
