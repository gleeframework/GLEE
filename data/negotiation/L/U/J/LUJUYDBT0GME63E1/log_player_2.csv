"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $875,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this incredible product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a good price for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and still leaves some room for profit for Alice. 
* Continuing to negotiate may lead to a lower price, but there's also the risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price. 
* Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price without the risk of losing out."
