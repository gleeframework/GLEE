"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $10500? It's a fair compromise and closer to what I can comfortably afford.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $10500. I can offer you the product for $11200. This is my final compromise, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11200 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10750.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $10750, Bob. I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11200 and $10750, which would be $11000. However, I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $10950. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm counting on you to make a decision.",10950.0,Alice,7,
