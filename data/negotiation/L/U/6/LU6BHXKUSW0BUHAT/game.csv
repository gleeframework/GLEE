"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $1,000,000 to me and I can buy it from John for that amount. Let's see if we can make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000.  I'm confident that $1,050,000 is a fair price for both of us. This is a significant saving for me while still providing you with a good return. Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise further and sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
