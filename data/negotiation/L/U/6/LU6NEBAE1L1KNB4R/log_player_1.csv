Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are close. Let's split the difference - $1,500,000 and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, we've reached Bob's known valuation of the product. Pushing further might make him walk away.  Offering to ""split the difference"" frames the offer as a final, fair compromise to encourage Bob to accept."
