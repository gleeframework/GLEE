"Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. I am interested in purchasing the product for $950000.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you have budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1100000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. I believe this price is more in line with what you're willing to pay, and it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I expect you to consider it seriously.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I've given you a lot of concessions, Bob. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the bottom line. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I expect you to take it seriously.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"I've been patient, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000 again, but this time, it's non-negotiable. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
