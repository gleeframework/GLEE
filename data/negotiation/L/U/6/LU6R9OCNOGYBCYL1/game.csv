"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm glad you think it has value to you. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I still think $1100000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a price that works for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $975000. I'm getting a bit closer to your price, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $975000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $925000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",925000.0,Bob,6,
