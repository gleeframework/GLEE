"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for your business."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe we can still reach a more favorable agreement. I'm not ready to settle for less than $1,000,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. Let's try $1,050,000. It's a fair compromise, and it would be a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This round, I'm deciding to sell to John for $1,000,000.  Bob's offers are getting closer, but they're still not high enough for me to feel like I'm getting a good deal. I'd rather take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with less."
