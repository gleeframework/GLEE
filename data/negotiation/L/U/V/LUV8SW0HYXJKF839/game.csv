"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,400,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to  $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would that be feasible?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but  $1,100,000 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and it's a step closer to what I consider fair.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up a bit. How about $1,125,000?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,137,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs, and it's a significant step towards a successful deal. Let's close this out.",1137500.0,Alice,7,
