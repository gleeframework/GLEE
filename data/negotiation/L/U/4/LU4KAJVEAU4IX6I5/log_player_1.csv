"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counter-offers. I'm also considering that I can sell to John for $150, so this initial offer is already a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below what I'm willing to accept, but it's also closer to my minimum price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer, hoping to reach a deal closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counter-offering at $160, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is getting close to my minimum price of $150. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a good deal considering I can always sell to John for $150.  I'm also running out of rounds, so it's in my best interest to close the deal now."
