"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can definitely get a better price than $1,400,000. You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value, I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$1,300,000 is a good price, saving you $200,000 compared to buying from John. There's always a chance you could get a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially going back to her original $1,400,000 price isn't worth it.  Let's accept this offer and move on."
