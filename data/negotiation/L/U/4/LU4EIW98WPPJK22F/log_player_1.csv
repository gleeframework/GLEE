"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a slightly higher price than my minimum value, hoping to leverage the fact that Bob might be willing to pay a little more to secure the product.  I'm also trying to build rapport with a friendly message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $65 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum value of $100. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  While I appreciate your offer, $65 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'd be willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob. I've lowered my price significantly from the previous round, but I'm still above my minimum value of $100. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind.  Could we possibly meet in the middle at $75?  That would work much better for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $100, and it's not a significant increase from his previous offer.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, but I'm determined to get closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm trying to be firm but fair. I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum value, but I'm still willing to compromise. I'm also acknowledging Bob's perspective and inviting him to share his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, this is getting close to my budget.  I'd be willing to do $78, but that's really as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $78 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a little closer to my target.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, but I'm still determined to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $82? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 82}
``` 

I'm trying to show Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal. I'm offering a price that's only slightly higher than his last offer, and I'm using a more persuasive tone to encourage him to accept. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price."
