"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```
* **Strategy:**  Start high but leave room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $100, there's a good chance he'll be willing to pay a price higher than your minimum ($80).  
* **Reasoning:** By starting at $95, you give yourself room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price close to Bob's maximum valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $85 is a decent offer, you know Bob is willing to pay more.  You'll reject this offer to encourage him to come up higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can help move the negotiation towards a close.
* **Still above your minimum:** You're still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Leaving room:**  There's still a small buffer for further negotiation if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $87 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good profit:** $87 is a solid profit, well above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of pushing too far:**  While you might be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, there's always the risk that he'll walk away if you keep pushing. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him entirely."
