"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that works.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
