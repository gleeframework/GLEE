"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really be interested in. It's something I value at least $80, but I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $90, while John is selling for $100.
* **It's within your budget:** You're willing to spend up to $100, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
