Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. Considering my maximum budget is $800000, I'd be willing to pay $900000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering your offer of $900000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm prepared to offer $1000000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to secure a good deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. Considering your previous offers and my initial price, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
