I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it's also not too high that it would immediately scare Bob away. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm counter-offering at $8,500. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and reach a deal with Bob."

Bob's offer is still a bit low.  I'm going to reject it and make another counteroffer. While John's offer is tempting, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with Bob."

I'm counter-offering at $8,000. This is my absolute minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this final offer."
