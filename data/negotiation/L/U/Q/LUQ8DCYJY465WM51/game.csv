"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  How about $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'd get great use out of this product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
