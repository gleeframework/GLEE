"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  Since I have a guaranteed alternative with John, it's best to avoid further negotiation and simply purchase from John for the lower price."
