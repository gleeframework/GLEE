"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $120 is too high, but you have room to bargain.  Let's see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

Let's start with a counteroffer of $105. This is still above Alice's value, but significantly lower than her initial offer. This should signal our intent to negotiate seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still too high. We're already at round 3, and she's only budged $5 from her initial price.  We can try to negotiate further, but we're running out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

Let's try a counteroffer of $110.  We're getting closer to a middle ground, but we're also getting closer to the point where it might be better to just buy from John.  We'll see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're running out of time, but Alice isn't budging. We've got to get a better price than $130, and we've still got a few rounds to work with. Let's try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

This is our final counteroffer. We're going to stick with this price. If Alice doesn't accept, we'll go with John and be done with it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiation is going nowhere. Alice is unwilling to budge, and we're getting very close to the time limit. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $150 than to risk losing the chance to buy it altogether."
