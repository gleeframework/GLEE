"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. My initial offer is $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  This leaves room for a potential compromise and hopefully gets Bob interested in buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I still believe I can get a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully gets us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $107? I'm hoping we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  $107 is still a good profit for me."
