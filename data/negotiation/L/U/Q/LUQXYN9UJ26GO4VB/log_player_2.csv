Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 remains significantly below what I can accept.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your persistence is admirable, but we're nearing the limit of what I can accept. My final offer is $1,600,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and leaves little room for further negotiation.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable conclusion, and I hope you'll agree.

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $1,600,000.  You can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, saving you $100,000. It makes more financial sense to buy from John at this point."
