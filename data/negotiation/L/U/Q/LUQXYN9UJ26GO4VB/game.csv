"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,125,000.",1125000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value, I'm willing to move closer to your price point. How about we consider $1,950,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 remains significantly below what I can accept.  This product holds exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see a considerable return on your investment.  To meet you halfway, I propose $1,725,000. This demonstrates significant flexibility on my part, and I hope it facilitates a mutually beneficial agreement.",1725000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, your persistence is admirable, but we're nearing the limit of what I can accept. My final offer is $1,600,000.
