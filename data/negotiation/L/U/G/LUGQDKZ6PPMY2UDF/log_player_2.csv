"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can save $50,000 by negotiating with Alice further.  While $950,000 is within your budget, there's potential to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get closer to Alice's minimum price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to establish a starting point for negotiation while showing a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000.  While further negotiation could potentially get a lower price, it's not guaranteed.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures a purchase within your budget and saves you $100,000 compared to John."
