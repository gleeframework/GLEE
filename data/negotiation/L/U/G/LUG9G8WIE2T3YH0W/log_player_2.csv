# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What do you think?

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is simply too steep for me. Given my research and the product's current market value, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, it still undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,750,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Alice's offer is still too high, but we're getting closer. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,750,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering our previous offers. This would allow us to both walk away with a profitable deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,625,000. This offer reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000.

Alice is getting closer, but it's still above my limit. It's worth seeing if we can get her down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,625,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $1,500,000 represents a fair and reasonable price that benefits both of us.
