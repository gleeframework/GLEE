"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than my actual limit ($10,000), I create room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** The tone remains positive and expresses continued interest in the product.
* **Leaving Room for Alice:** This counteroffer gives Alice space to counter back, hopefully within a range closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $11,000. Would that be something you'd consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down, the price is still above my absolute limit.  I'll try to negotiate one more time, but I'm prepared to walk away and go with John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd hoped. How about we settle at $9,500?  That's a fair compromise, I think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Pushing the Limit:** I'm moving closer to my $10,000 maximum, but still leaving a little room for negotiation (just in case). 
* **Seeking Compromise:** The tone emphasizes finding a solution that works for both sides.
* **Deadline in Mind:** I'm aware that John's offer is always on the table, so I'm applying some pressure without being aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum. I can do $10,500. That's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $10,500, and that's above my maximum budget.  It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure the product from John for $10,000."
