"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $11,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd hoped. How about we settle at $9,500?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum. I can do $10,500. That's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",10500.0,Alice,5,
