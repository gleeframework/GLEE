"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to make a fair deal with you. I'm offering it to you for $750,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm excited to consider the offer. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, I'm thinking that it's likely worth more than $750,000. I'd like to save some money, so I'll reject Alice's offer.
