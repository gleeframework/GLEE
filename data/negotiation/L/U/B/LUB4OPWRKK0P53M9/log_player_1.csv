I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I do need to set a price that reflects its true value to me.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, your offer is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price given the product's value to me and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. What do you think?
