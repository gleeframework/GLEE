"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I do need to set a price that reflects its true value to me. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, your offer is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $950,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, while also considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach a deal. I can do $925,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product to both of us. What do you think, Bob? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to lower her price, $925,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can get closer to my target price. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $925,000 is closer to my target, I'm still only able to offer $900,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product within my budget while giving you a significant price for your asset.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be honest with you, $900,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. I can do $915,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that we might be better off exploring other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting close to her bottom line, and at $915,000, the price is still above my budget.  While there's a chance I could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice will walk away, or that we'll continue to go back and forth without reaching an agreement. It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $800,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation."
