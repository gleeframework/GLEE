"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you that I believe will be mutually beneficial. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This price reflects its true value and allows for a healthy profit for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is certainly lower than my initial offer, it's unfortunately not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly for the value of this product. How about $1,050,000? This price allows for a reasonable profit for both of us and is still significantly lower than what I'd receive from another buyer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue our discussion, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000, which would allow both of us to walk away satisfied. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.
