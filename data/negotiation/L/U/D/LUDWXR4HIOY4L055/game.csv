"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,000,000.  Would you be open to $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $975,000. I'm willing to compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $990,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close the deal.  What do you say?",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I'm not quite ready to accept $990,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,015,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 to close this deal. It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,9,
