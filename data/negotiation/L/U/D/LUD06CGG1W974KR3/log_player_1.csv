"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm starting at $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's crucial to start with a price that allows room for negotiation. $15,000 gives us some wiggle room while still being significantly higher than the minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly tone helps build rapport and keeps Bob open to discussion.
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the product's value to *you* implies it's worth a substantial sum. This can subtly increase Bob's perception of its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** While $10,000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can do better. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested. Rejecting gives me the opportunity to counter with a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Testing Bob's Limits:** This move allows me to gauge how serious Bob is about acquiring the product and his upper price limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This still gives me some room, but it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows flexibility while still aiming for a price that's significantly above Bob's initial offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I keep the conversation friendly and focus on finding a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  The offer presents a middle ground that feels fair to both parties, increasing the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Open-Ended:** I leave the door open for further discussion and counteroffers if Bob is still unwilling to meet this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $12500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $11000, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try for a slightly higher price, there's a chance Bob will walk away.  This offer is a good compromise that secures a decent profit.
* **Time Factor:** We're nearing the middle of the negotiation process.  Accepting ensures a deal is made, and I avoid the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
