"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm starting at $15000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant drop from Alice's initial offer signals a strong desire to buy while leaving room for negotiation.  $10,000 is my maximum price, so if Alice rejects this, I'll move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I'm willing to come down to $12500.  This still gives me some room, but it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my maximum. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $11,000, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm incrementally raising my offer, but still staying below my maximum.  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while pushing towards a price closer to my target."
