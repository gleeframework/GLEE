I'm starting with an offer of $1,250,000.  This is a good starting point, as it is a reasonable increase from the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see what Bob's response is before considering going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to sell,  $1,150,000 is too low.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is my minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to meet me there.  If he doesn't, I'll sell to John."
