You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can potentially save $50,000 by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer is now at your maximum price point, and there's no guarantee of further negotiation. Buying from John would cost the same, so accepting Alice's offer is the best option to finalize the purchase."
