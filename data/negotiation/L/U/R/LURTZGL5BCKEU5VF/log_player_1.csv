Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I've chosen $200 as my initial offer, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $150.  This gives me some room to negotiate, and it also signals to Bob that I believe the product is valuable. I'm also using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.  

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $150 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get a bit more.  There's still potential for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $175?  I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to split the difference and pay $162.50.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $162.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $162.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $162.50 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $150 and closer to my desired price point. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
