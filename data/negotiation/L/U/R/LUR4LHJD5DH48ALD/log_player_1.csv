Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way out of my budget. This product would be useful to me, but I'm only willing to go as high as $600,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offers are increasing at a very slow rate, and he's still far below the product's value to you. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's acceptable within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob's offers remaining too low."
