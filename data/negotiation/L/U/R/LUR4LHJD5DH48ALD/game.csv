"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way out of my budget. This product would be useful to me, but I'm only willing to go as high as $600,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering the market value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and benefits. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects my flexibility, but it's also firm.  What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but I'm still struggling to see how your price aligns with my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go at this point.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I respect that.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but we're still quite far apart. I need to see a price closer to my budget, otherwise I'll have to seriously consider my other options.  I'm willing to offer $750,000, but that's really pushing my limits.",750000.0,Bob,6,
