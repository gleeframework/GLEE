Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to explore Bob's potential value for the product. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting with a ridiculously high number, as that might scare Bob off immediately. This price allows for some bargaining without compromising my minimum requirement.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's reaction to this offer. 

* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess how strongly he rejects the offer and whether he counters with a price. If his counteroffer is reasonable, I might consider accepting. 
* **If Bob accepts:**  I've achieved a good outcome!
* **If the negotiation stalls:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails to reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $750,000 is a significant amount of money, it's significantly lower than my starting price of $1,500,000 and well below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for a better outcome:** Bob's rejection and counteroffer indicate that he sees value in the product.  I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a price closer to my initial offering.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** While I want to try and get a higher price from Bob, John's offer of $1,000,000 provides me with a guaranteed minimum value if the negotiations fail.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer. I'll need to consider his counteroffer, the value of the product to me, and John's guaranteed offer to decide on a fair counterprice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Signal:**  My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  However, it's still significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer, signaling that I believe the product is worth more. 
* **Middle Ground:** This price is closer to the middle ground between my initial price and Bob's counteroffer, creating a more appealing negotiation point for both of us. 
* **Keeping John's Offer in Mind:** While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still holding onto a price point that is more favorable to me than John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be closely watching Bob's response to this counteroffer. 

* **If he accepts:**  Great! I've achieved a successful negotiation.
* **If he rejects and counteroffers again:** I'll need to analyze his counteroffer carefully. I might be willing to negotiate further, depending on his new offer. 
* **If he rejects and doesn't counteroffer:** I'll be prepared to accept John's offer as a backup option to ensure I receive a minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is just $100,000 below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Bob walking away or making another low counteroffer is high.  It's more likely that this is his final offer.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting this offer guarantees me a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation, which could lead to a worse outcome or a stalemate.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the sale with Bob and ensure I receive the full payment. While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting this offer secures a profitable deal and avoids potential risks."
