"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's value but still gives him some room to negotiate. This allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum while still keeping the deal open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, aiming for a higher price. I believe there's still room for us to come to a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. This price is still fair for both of us, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a little high for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $95.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to earn more, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John for $120 is also an option, but I'm willing to take a slight loss in this round to potentially secure a sale with Bob.  I might be able to build a relationship with Bob for future transactions, and a small profit is better than no profit at all."
