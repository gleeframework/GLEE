Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential compromise with Bob.  It also makes you appear willing to negotiate, increasing the likelihood of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to him. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer represents a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility, but still higher than Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not give away the product for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $300 less than my minimum acceptable price, and it's unlikely he will offer more. Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
