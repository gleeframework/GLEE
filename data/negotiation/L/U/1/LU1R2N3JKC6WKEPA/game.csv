"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has value, that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I can go down to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
