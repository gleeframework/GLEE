Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  To maximize profit, aim for a price closer to Bob's valuation. Offering it at $1,350,000 gives Bob a $150,000 discount (making it more enticing), while you secure a $350,000 profit above your minimum.

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or other factors that might influence his decision."
