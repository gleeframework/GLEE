Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, his offer is too far from my minimum price. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's worthwhile for me, so it's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
