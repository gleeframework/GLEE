"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
 
While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,175,000?  I believe this price is fair for both of us, and will allow us to move forward with this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

While $1,150,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I believe I can get a better offer from Bob, or I can always sell to John."

Round 5

Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
