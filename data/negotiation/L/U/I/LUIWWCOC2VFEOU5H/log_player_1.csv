``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is still beneficial to you but leaves some room for negotiation. It is important to present it in a positive way that emphasizes the value Bob is getting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it is significantly lower than what the product is worth to you.  You can do better than $900,000.  You will attempt to negotiate further with Bob to reach a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you, given the value you place on the product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to your ideal price, you're still not satisfied.  You'll try to push Bob a bit further. You're willing to negotiate but not at the expense of losing a substantial portion of the product's value to you."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it ensures both of us get a good deal. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
