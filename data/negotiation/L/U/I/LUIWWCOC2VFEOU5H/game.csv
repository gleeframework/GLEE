"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you, given the value you place on the product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it ensures both of us get a good deal. Let's close this deal!",975000.0,Alice,5,
