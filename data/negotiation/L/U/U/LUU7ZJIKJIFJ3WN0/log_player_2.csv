"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. It's above his budget and he can get the product for $10,000 from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $9500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept $10000 for the product. This is a fair price, and it's still below what I could get from another buyer. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is the same price he could get from John, so there's no benefit to continuing the negotiation."
