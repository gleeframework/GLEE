"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be extremely valuable for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
