Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but I am only willing to pay $950,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $950,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I still feel that $950,000 is a reasonable price for the product. I would like to stick with this figure, as it aligns better with my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While I'm starting to get nervous about the dwindling rounds, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'll counter again, hoping to inch closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  I'm willing to make a final concession.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This is my last offer, and if it's not acceptable, I might have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline. I am still unable to meet you at $1,050,000. My maximum offer remains at $950,000. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a stalemate with Bob. He's unwilling to budge, and I'm not willing to go lower than $1,050,000. With only four rounds left, it's too risky to keep negotiating with him. I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a secure sale that guarantees I get a decent amount of money."
