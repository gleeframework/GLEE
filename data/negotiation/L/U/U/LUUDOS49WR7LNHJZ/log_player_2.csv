Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,210,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.

Alice's final counteroffer of $1,210,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether.  I'll buy the product from John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get the product at my desired price."
