"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I'm not able to go that high.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going.  I'm prepared to offer you $1,200,000, my final offer. This is the absolute maximum I can pay for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,210,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
