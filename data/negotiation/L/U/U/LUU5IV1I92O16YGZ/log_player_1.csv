Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've carefully considered our previous discussions and decided to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This price is based on my budget constraints while still acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is the best move at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  $1,600,000 is still a substantial profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I receive the payment sooner, allowing me to potentially reinvest it faster. 
* **Negotiation Risk:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome."
