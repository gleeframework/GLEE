"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to start the negotiation high. While her offer is less than your $1,000,000 maximum, you know you have a backup option with John.  By rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price closer to her $800,000 valuation."
