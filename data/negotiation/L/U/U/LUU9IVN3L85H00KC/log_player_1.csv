Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product for $130, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob rejects the offer, but also ensures I'm not losing too much money. 
* By starting with a relatively high price, I'm setting the tone for the negotiation and hoping to push Bob closer to my desired selling point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While $95 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. 
* I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm counter-offering at $115, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $95. 
* This shows flexibility while still maintaining a price point closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and hopefully encourage Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* While $100 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough for me. 
* I've already gone through two rounds of negotiation and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to pay a price closer to my desired value.
* Rather than continue negotiating and potentially risk ending up with a price lower than $100, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150, ensuring I reach my minimum goal."
