"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $900,000.  Alice values the product at $800,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs.  I'm happy to negotiate, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's target price:** Alice's offer of $875,000 is only $25,000 more than Bob's counteroffer of $850,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away, forcing Bob to buy from John at $1,000,000. 
* **Savings are significant:**  Accepting the offer saves Bob $125,000 compared to buying from John.

While there's always the possibility of pushing for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential reward of a few thousand dollars."
