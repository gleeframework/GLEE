Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is quite low, and we have plenty of rounds to negotiate.  I'll try to meet him closer to the middle. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $13,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $15,500 is still more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $14,000? That's a significant compromise on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's not worth the risk of Bob's offer going lower.  I'd rather take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
