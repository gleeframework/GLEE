"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm not interested in paying $2,000,000 for the product. That's way over my budget of $800,000. I'll reject Alice's offer.
