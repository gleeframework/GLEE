"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John.  Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than what we're willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it leaves room for her to counter and for us to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $80?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a great outcome! Alice met our ideal price. We get the product at the best possible price without needing to go to John."
