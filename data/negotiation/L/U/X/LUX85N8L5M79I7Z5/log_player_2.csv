"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob should reject the offer. $900,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price, especially since he has the option of buying from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows a willingness to negotiate but also sets a clear expectation of a lower price."
