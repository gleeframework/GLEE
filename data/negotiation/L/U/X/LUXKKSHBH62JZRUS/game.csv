"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply and your interest in the product. I understand your perspective on the price. While $13,500 represents a fair valuation of its worth, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $11,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could you consider $10,500? I think that would be a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly. How about we settle at $10,600? That's a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",10600.0,Bob,6,
