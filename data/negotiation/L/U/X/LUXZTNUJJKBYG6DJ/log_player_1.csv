"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. It's a reasonable starting point that's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is still a fair amount above my minimum price but closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate. I hope this will be enough to entice Bob to close the deal."
