**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  He's moved less than $70,000 in 5 rounds. Accepting his current offer would mean a loss of at least $180,000 compared to John's guaranteed offer. The remaining rounds are unlikely to bridge that gap. It's time to secure the guaranteed profit with John."
