Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000 for it. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (your valuation and John's offer), you have leverage to start high. 
* **Justification for Value:**  The message hints at the product's value (""significant value"", ""exceed your expectations"") without revealing specifics and potentially anchoring Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's perspective (""What are your thoughts?""), leaving room for negotiation if he counters.

By starting at $2,000,000, you aim to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts, you gain an extra $500,000.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will reveal how much he values the product and his willingness to pay.  

This strategy gives you the best chance to extract maximum value from the sale while still being reasonable enough to potentially secure a deal with Bob."
