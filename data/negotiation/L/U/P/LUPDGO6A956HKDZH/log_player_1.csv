"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for potential bargaining. It also sets a positive tone by acknowledging the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it falls below my minimum value for the product. Accepting it would be a loss. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price, but I'm not desperate.  John's offer serves as a safety net, so I'm not pressured to accept anything below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is tempting, it's below my minimum value. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer the product for $1,000,000. This ensures a fair deal for both of us and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $950000? I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value.  I'm committed to getting at least $1,000,000 for the product. Since I have John as a backup buyer, I'm not pressured to settle for less. I will counteroffer again, and if Bob doesn't budge, I'm prepared to move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above my minimum.  Let's try $975,000. This leaves a bit of room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $975000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $960000. I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price and make it a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still slightly below it.  I'm not willing to accept anything less than $1,000,000 at this point.  With John as a backup, I have the leverage to hold out for a better price.  I will counteroffer again and hope Bob will finally meet my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate that.  However, $960,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's settle on $990,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 990000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $990000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $970000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds left, the negotiation is becoming increasingly time-consuming. While Bob's offer of $970,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum of $1,000,000, it makes more sense to accept his offer and avoid further haggling.  I'm confident that I'll secure a better price than Bob is currently offering, and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal altogether."
