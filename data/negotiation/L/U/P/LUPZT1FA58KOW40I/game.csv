"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've already taken a significant discount from the initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1100000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1050000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $1080000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
