"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly special. I believe it's worth more than what it costs me, but I'm willing to start our negotiation at $100. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'll offer the product at $90, which is still above your initial offer but closer to my cost. I hope this proposal suits your budget better.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $90 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85? That way we both get a good deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
