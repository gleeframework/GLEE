Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a bit of a compromise, as it's more than Bob's perceived value but less than my minimum. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with $105. It's a small compromise from my previous offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation while staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still being a decent deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've already gone through two rounds of negotiation and it seems like we're getting nowhere. It's not worth risking a lower price, especially when I have a guaranteed sale with John for $120."
