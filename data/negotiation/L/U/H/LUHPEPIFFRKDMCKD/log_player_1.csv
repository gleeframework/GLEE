Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $9,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,000 allows a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate. 
* **Strong but Fair:** This price point suggests you understand the product's value, making it more likely Bob will take the offer seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might consider a slightly lower initial offer. 
* **Urgency:** If you need to sell the product quickly, you might lower the price slightly to encourage a faster decision."
