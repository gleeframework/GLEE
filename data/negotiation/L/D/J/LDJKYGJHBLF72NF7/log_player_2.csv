Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to go down to $9,000. While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's still higher than your preferred price. You can still try to negotiate further to get a better deal. There's still room for a compromise, and you might be able to reach a price closer to your $8,500 target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll lower the price to $8,900. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is very close to your counteroffer of $8,750.  It's likely that further negotiation will be difficult, and you might not be able to get a lower price.  It's better to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a stalemate or needing to buy from John at a much higher price."
