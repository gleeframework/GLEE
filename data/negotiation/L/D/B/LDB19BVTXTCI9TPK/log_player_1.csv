{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation, while still ensuring you make a profit.  It's also friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I am still looking to keep my spending within $80. Could we perhaps aim for $110 as a compromise? This would allow us to stay closer to my budget while still respecting the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $110 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit. Selling to John for $120 guarantees you a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
