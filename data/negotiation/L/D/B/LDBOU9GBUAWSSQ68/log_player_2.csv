{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for it."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, signaling a willingness to negotiate. It's a starting point for a back-and-forth, leaving room for some compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I still think the product is worth more than $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still above my maximum willingness to pay. I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if we can reach an agreement closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to go to $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer is a small step closer to Alice's offer.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but am still trying to get the price lower.  This approach may encourage Alice to make a final concession."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to you. I think it's a fair price, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $10,750 is still above my maximum price point of $10,000. I'm still holding out for a better deal and will try to negotiate further. It's possible that Alice might be willing to come down further, especially as we're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still trying to get the price down a bit.  I'm going to offer you $10,250.  If we can agree on this, I'm ready to buy the product right now."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step closer to Alice's offer, showing I'm serious about buying. It's also below my maximum price point, giving me some wiggle room if Alice needs to counter.  This creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the price down, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer it to you for $10,475. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,475. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,475

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,475 is still above my maximum price point of $10,000. We're in the 7th round and with only 3 rounds left, the possibility of a better price from Alice is slim. I'd rather buy from John at $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
