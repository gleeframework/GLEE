Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we also know it's worth $1,200,000 to us (and we have a guaranteed buyer at that price). Therefore, it makes sense to start negotiations with an offer closer to our desired outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob. It allows for some back-and-forth while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" to subtly nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price.  

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, Alice (you) might adjust the price slightly downwards in subsequent offers. However, it's crucial to remain firm and be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price point that's acceptable to you, knowing you have John as a secure backup buyer."
