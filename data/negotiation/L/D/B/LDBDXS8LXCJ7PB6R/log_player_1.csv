Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging a response.  We'll see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $12,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I believe I can get closer to my target price by countering. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still working within a strict budget. Could we possibly meet at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price.  I want to push for a higher offer. I'll counter again and see if I can get Bob closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm prepared to go down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. This price allows us both to make a good deal. Let's try to reach an agreement, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand your position, but I am still committed to staying within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is now within my minimum acceptable price range, and we're only halfway through the negotiations. I don't want to risk losing this potential buyer and having to deal with John. This price is a good compromise and I'm happy to accept it."
