"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price. Since Bob values the product at $800,000, it's unlikely he'll accept this offer in the first round. However, it establishes my starting point and sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than what I can get from John. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept, but if not, we can continue to refine the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm running out of time. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a better deal than selling to John and leaving me with the risk of potentially losing the deal in future rounds with Bob."
