"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know it's worth a significant amount more to you. Let's work together to make this a win-win situation.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in your product, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal happen. It's still a great price for you, considering the product's value to your business. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this transaction.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $860,000, but I think we can do better than that. Can you meet me at $880,000?",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  $880,000 is a good starting point, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work.  Let's compromise at $890,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $880,000 and $890,000, which would be $885,000. Can we meet at that price?",885000.0,Bob,6,
