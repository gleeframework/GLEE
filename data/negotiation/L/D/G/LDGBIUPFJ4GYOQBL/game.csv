"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $180 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product, which I believe is a fair price. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $140.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is still a bit lower than what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for $145, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. How about we settle at $140? It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",140.0,Bob,6,
