"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value while still giving you a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now below Bob's maximum price:**  Alice has dropped her price to $13,500, which is within Bob's budget of $15,000. 
* **Negotiating further might not be worth the risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or a longer negotiation process. 
* **Saving money is important:**  While Bob could potentially get a lower price, there's no guarantee. Accepting the offer ensures a purchase at a price below Bob's original limit."
