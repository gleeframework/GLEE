"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is better than my minimum, I think I can still get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm dropping the price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and close the deal.  I'm not going to drop too much further, as I'm still confident John will buy it if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $14,500 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I have several rounds left to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15250}
```

I'm dropping the price a bit more, but I'm still confident I can get a better price than John's offer. This is a good middle ground, and hopefully Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer this time.  We're getting closer to a deal and I'm running out of time. It's worth accepting his offer, as it's only $250 less than what John would pay. I don't want to risk losing out on the deal completely by rejecting Bob and then being unable to get a better offer from him in the remaining rounds."
