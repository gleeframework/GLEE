"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is at least $1,500,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  Let's make this simple - I can offer you $1,100,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, don't you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
