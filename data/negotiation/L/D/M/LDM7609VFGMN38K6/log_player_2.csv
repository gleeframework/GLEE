"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's fair to both of us.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.  Let's talk about a price of $9,500.  This gives you a significant saving and me a good return on my investment.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. If I buy the product from her for $9,500, I'd be saving $500 compared to buying it from John, but I can do even better. I'll reject the offer and buy the product from John for $10,000.
