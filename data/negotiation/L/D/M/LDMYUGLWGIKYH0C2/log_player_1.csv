Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's a chance Bob might accept this price. It's the highest price that ensures you don't lose money.
* **Direct and Clear:**  The message is straightforward and avoids haggling, which could potentially lead to Bob offering less.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning listing it publicly, you imply Bob could miss out if he doesn't act.

**Important Note:** Bob's perceived value of the product is lower than yours. There's a risk he'll reject the offer. However, this strategy aims for the best possible outcome before accepting the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
