,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm looking for.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $850000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer.
