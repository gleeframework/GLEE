"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $10000. Can you consider a counteroffer of $11000? I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway again.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll offer the product to you for $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway again, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I really need to stay within my budget of $10000. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $10800. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider purchasing the product from you.",10800.0,Bob,6,
