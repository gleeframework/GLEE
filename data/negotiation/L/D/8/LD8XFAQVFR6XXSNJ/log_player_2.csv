"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for compromise.  Offering $100 is a strong starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still potential to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but still wants to save as much as possible. Offering $110 is a compromise, but still leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer is just $10 more than Bob's ideal price. It's getting close to John's price of $150, and continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling through. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
