"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this revised counteroffer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, so I'm offering $1,275,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal in the next few rounds. ",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this revised counteroffer?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of our negotiation, and I'm committed to finding a solution.  However, $1,250,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference one last time. I'm offering $1,262,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let me know what you think.",1262500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll offer $1,256,250. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can consider it.",1256250.0,Bob,8,
