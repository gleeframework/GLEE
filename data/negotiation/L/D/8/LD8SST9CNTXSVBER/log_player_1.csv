"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this revised counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can secure a higher price with continued negotiation. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, so I'm offering $1,275,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal in the next few rounds. "", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this revised counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While it's tempting to accept $1,250,000, I'm still holding out for a better offer. We've only got four rounds left, so I need to be strategic. I'll make one last counteroffer to Bob before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of our negotiation, and I'm committed to finding a solution.  However, $1,250,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference one last time. I'm offering $1,262,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1262500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll offer $1,256,250. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,256,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,256,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only two rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to reject Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, $1,256,250 is a decent return and better than selling to John.  It's time to close the deal."
