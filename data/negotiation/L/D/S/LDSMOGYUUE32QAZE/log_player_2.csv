"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's valued at $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price with Alice first. We have room to bargain before reaching John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price feels a bit high to me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's initial offer. Starting with a low counter-offer gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is courteous but makes it clear we're looking for a significant discount. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counter-offer is closer to Alice's value ($80) than our maximum ($120), putting some pressure on her while still leaving us space to increase our offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $85? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is coming down, but we're still significantly above her value ($80) and we have rounds to spare. Let's signal that we're willing to walk away unless the price gets closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. I'm still interested, but I'd need it to be closer to $75 to make it work for me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're showing a willingness to move, but only slightly. This signals that we're serious about the lower price range.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  We haven't accepted her compromise, keeping the pressure on Alice to drop closer to her value. 
* **Deadline Awareness:**  While we have rounds left, we're starting to narrow the gap to avoid reaching a point where we have to choose between a bad deal and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you, but I can't go lower than $80. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has hit her lowest acceptable price ($80, her value).  There's no point in pushing further, as she's unlikely to go lower. Accepting this offer gets us the best possible deal from Alice."
