"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $8500. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is my best compromise at this point.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $9000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time, I'll offer it to you for $10250. This is my final compromise.",10250.0,Alice,5,
