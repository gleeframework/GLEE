"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, given its value to me. What do you say?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you. Let's meet in the middle!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference at $100?  It's a fair price for both of us and we can close this deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
