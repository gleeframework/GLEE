,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference at $10,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let's close this deal!",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800 to make this deal work.  This is a great opportunity for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this now!",9800.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I still need to save a bit more. How about we meet at $9,500 again? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
