"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working within a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to stay within my limit. I'll offer $950000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle again?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm counteroffering at $1100000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your latest bid. I believe this price reflects the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still trying to make the best deal. I'll offer $990000 for the product. This is as high as I'm willing to go. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $990000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'm offering $1050000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your latest bid. If this doesn't work, I'll consider selling the product to John for $1200000.
