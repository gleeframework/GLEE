Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here.  To be fair to both of us, I'll come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

It's unlikely Alice will go substantially lower than her $1,100,000 offer.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, saving you a significant amount."
