Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a more comfortable price for me, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I still think $1,200,000 is a more reasonable price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very consistently sticking around the $1,200,000 mark. This indicates that he likely sees the product's value closer to his initial offer than to my initial ask. However, I know the product is worth significantly more to him.  I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can secure a price closer to $1,250,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,240,000?  This reflects my commitment to reaching a deal while still recognizing the true value of this product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has firmly reiterated his $1,225,000 offer and signaled this is likely his ceiling. While I'd prefer a higher price, continuing to push might make Bob walk away. Accepting now secures a good profit above my minimum, and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or me needing to settle for John's $800,000."
