Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, providing a brief reason (even if generic) can make Bob more receptive. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, you can always negotiate down towards $80. 

**Important:** This assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above $80."
