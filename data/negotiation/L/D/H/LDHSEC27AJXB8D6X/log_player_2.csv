"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $120 is still above your maximum price of $150.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point because it's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. Alice is likely to counter with a higher price, but this sets a good baseline for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still above your maximum price of $150.  It's better to reject the offer and continue negotiating for a lower price. You have already demonstrated you are willing to pay less than $120, and Alice has shown flexibility by dropping her offer from $120 to $115.  You can use this to your advantage by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It is higher than your previous offer but still lower than Alice's current offer. It shows that you are willing to move towards a deal, but you are not willing to pay Alice's full asking price.  It also shows that you are taking Alice's offer seriously and are willing to negotiate in good faith. You have four rounds left, and you are hoping to find a price that is mutually acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $119 is still above your maximum price of $150. You have only 5 rounds remaining, and the negotiation seems to be getting stuck. At this point, it's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $150. While it's not your ideal price, it's a more certain outcome than risking further rounds of negotiation and potentially being forced to accept an even higher price from Alice."
