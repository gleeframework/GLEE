"I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. It's a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit high for you, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $17,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $17,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $13,500.  Would that be feasible?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise further, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $18,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I've invested in it. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but our price expectations seem far apart.  To be completely transparent, I can get a similar product for $15,000 elsewhere. I'm willing to offer you $14,000 for yours, as I do see some unique benefits. If that doesn't work, I'll need to explore my other option.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you have options, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell for $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $18,000, which is $16,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to come up slightly to $14,500.  That's my final offer.  If it doesn't work, I'll have to go with the other option I mentioned.",14500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $17,000. I'm willing to make one final concession, so I'll meet you at $15,500. That's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.",15500.0,Alice,9,
