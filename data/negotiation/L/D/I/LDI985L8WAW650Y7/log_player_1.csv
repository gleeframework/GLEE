Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $10,000, aiming higher initially allows for potential profit beyond the guaranteed $10,000 from John. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high provides space for negotiation if Bob counter-offers. It shows you value the product while leaving room to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a risk Bob might outright reject the offer. However, the potential gain from a higher selling price outweighs the risk of losing him as a buyer, given the guaranteed $10,000 backup offer from John. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with negotiation and the possibility of Bob rejecting the initial offer."
