"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $600,000 is too far below my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it gives me some room to work with.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $720,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and demonstrates my strong interest in making this deal work.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $720,000 just isn't feasible for me.  Let's try $800,000. This would be a win-win for both of us â€“ you'd get a fantastic product at a competitive price, and I'd get a fair return on my investment. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
