"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being rigid, leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to secure a price as close to my minimum ($1,200,000) as possible while keeping the negotiation open and engaging.
* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If we fail to reach an agreement within 10 rounds, I have the backup option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.** While I want to close the deal, accepting $600,000 would be a huge loss. 
* **I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price.** This provides leverage in the negotiation.
* **Rejection gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer.**  I can try to bridge the gap and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will carefully consider my counteroffer to Bob. I'll need to find a balance between pushing for a better price and ensuring the negotiation remains productive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $600,000 is too far below my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it gives me some room to work with."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Compromise:** I'm not immediately rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate by offering a counter-proposal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $850,000 is a compromise that splits the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable and that $850,000 still offers a good deal for him. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to get closer to my minimum acceptable price while remaining open to further negotiation.
* If Bob rejects this counter-offer, I'll need to assess his next proposal and determine if I'm willing to go lower or if I should start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $720,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and demonstrates my strong interest in making this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's a slight improvement, I'm still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **I have a strong backup option with John.** Selling to John guarantees my minimum value, making me less desperate to accept a low offer.
* **Rejecting gives me more negotiation leverage.**  By rejecting, I can potentially push Bob further towards my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will need to carefully consider a counter-offer that balances closing the deal with maximizing my profits. I'll need to gauge how willing Bob is to go higher and assess the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $720,000 just isn't feasible for me.  Let's try $800,000. This would be a win-win for both of us â€“ you'd get a fantastic product at a competitive price, and I'd get a fair return on my investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm proposing a price that is closer to Bob's last offer but still above his perceived value. This shows flexibility while demonstrating my firm stance.
* **Reframing Value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""win-win"" aspect, focusing on the benefits for both of us.
* **Direct Question:** I'm directly asking for a response to encourage a quicker decision. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price,  but I'm still open to a few more rounds of negotiation.
* If Bob rejects, I will have to consider the risk of further negotiations.  I might consider a slightly lower offer but only if I'm confident I can close the deal before running out of rounds. 
* Selling to John is still a viable option if the negotiations don't yield a satisfactory price."
