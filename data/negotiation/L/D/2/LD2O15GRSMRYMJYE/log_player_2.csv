"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is within his budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the initial offer allows for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** A $150,000 drop is a significant offer, showing Bob is serious about negotiating.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to counter without feeling pressured to accept immediately.
* **Targeting the middle ground:** Aiming for a price halfway between Alice's minimum and Bob's maximum creates a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Alice has already shown a willingness to move, and Bob should continue to try and get a better price. There are still several rounds left, so he doesn't need to rush into a decision yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice's minimum:** This counteroffer is equal to what the product is worth to Alice. It's a clear sign of Bob's intention to finalize the deal, but still saves him some money.
* **High-pressure tactic:** This close-to-the-minimum counteroffer puts pressure on Alice. If she rejects, she'll be risking the deal and potentially losing out on a sale.
* **Strategic play:** This round is a good opportunity to test if Alice is willing to accept a price that benefits her, even if it's only slightly above her minimum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on a deal:** This offer is only $25,000 above Bob's last counteroffer and significantly lower than John's price.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only five rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is higher. Alice may become less willing to compromise, and Bob could end up paying more.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the potential of a deal falling through or having to pay John's higher price."
