Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is above my minimum value, but I'm hoping to get a good deal. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum value, so accepting it is the best option. It guarantees me a sale and I don't have to risk further negotiation."
