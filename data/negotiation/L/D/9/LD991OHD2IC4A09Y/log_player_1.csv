Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have the time and Bob is potentially willing to pay a premium. If you need to sell quickly, a price closer to $1,200,000 would be more sensible."
