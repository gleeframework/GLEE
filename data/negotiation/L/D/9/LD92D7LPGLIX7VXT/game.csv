"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $100?  It's a fair price for a product I value at $80, and I'm sure we can work something out.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $125 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $112.50. I'm sure we can both agree that's a reasonable price for this product.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $112.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $112.50, which would be $118.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",118.5,Alice,5,
