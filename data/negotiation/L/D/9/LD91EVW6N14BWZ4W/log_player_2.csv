"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for a price of $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice is heavily inflating the price and trying to take advantage of your $1,000,000 limit. While John's price is higher than Alice's offer, it's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
