Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me closer to my price, Bob. I think we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I can offer it to you for $985,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both live with.

This is a good deal! Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and you've managed to get the price down to a point where it's significantly lower than John's offer.  It's unlikely you'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
