Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the value to Bob, making the offer more appealing.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:**  I'm aiming for a good profit margin.
* **Avoid Quick Sale:**  While John is a guaranteed buyer, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.
* **Encourage Negotiation:** By leaving room for counteroffers, I'm fostering a back-and-forth that might lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,000 is too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'm aiming for. Accepting it would mean missing out on a potentially better deal. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  There's room for a counteroffer that might bridge the gap.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer to try and secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still below what I need.  How about $10,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value, subtly suggesting that $10,500 is still a good deal for him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a call to action, encouraging further negotiation and hinting that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Time is Money:**  We've been negotiating for a while, and it's clear Bob is not willing to budge much further.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit, which is a safe and reliable option given the current situation.

**Conclusion:**  I've maximized my chance of getting a higher price from Bob, but it's time to move on to a guaranteed sale with John."
