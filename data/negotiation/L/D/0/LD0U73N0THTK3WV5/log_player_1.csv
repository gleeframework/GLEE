Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your $12,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  He's willing to pay $15,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for bargaining:**  This leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and for you to potentially increase the price further.

Remember, you can always fall back on John's $12,000 offer if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's important to remember that John is still an option, and selling to him guarantees you at least your minimum.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,250 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price point.  You have a guaranteed alternative with John's offer, and it's worth pushing for a slightly higher price to maximize your profit.  You can counteroffer again, potentially meeting Bob halfway between your current offer and his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $11,875? It's a fair compromise that's closer to my value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11875} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting a bit too drawn out. I'm willing to go up slightly to $11,500, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $11,500 is still slightly below your ideal price point, but it's getting close. However, you've already gone through several rounds of negotiations, and it's likely that further bargaining will be time-consuming and may not lead to a significantly better outcome. 

Since John is offering a guaranteed $12,000, it's a safer and more efficient choice to sell to him. You'll get a price that's closer to your minimum and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
