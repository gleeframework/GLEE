"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2000000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value and potential. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $2000000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given my initial research, I'd be willing to offer $500000 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my part and would give us a starting point for further discussions. What are your thoughts?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm afraid it's still below the product's true value. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000. This is a compromise between our initial positions, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1200000 is still a stretch for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer $800000 for the product. This would allow us to both get a good deal and move forward.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $800000 is still below the product's true value. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
