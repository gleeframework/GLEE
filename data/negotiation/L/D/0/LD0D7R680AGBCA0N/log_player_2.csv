"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2000000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value and potential. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's highly unlikely Alice will accept a counteroffer that is significantly lower in the first round. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and start the negotiation process with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $2,000,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given my initial research, I'd be willing to offer $500,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my part and would give us a starting point for further discussions. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm afraid it's still below the product's true value. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000. This is a compromise between our initial positions, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's budget.  While it's a lower price than the initial offer, it's not a good deal for Bob.  There's still room for negotiation and Bob can attempt to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a stretch for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product. This would allow us to both get a good deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $800000 is still below the product's true value. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While there's potential for further negotiation, it's unclear if Bob can get Alice to drop the price low enough in the remaining rounds.  Rather than risk losing more time and potentially getting stuck with a higher price, Bob is better off taking the guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000."
