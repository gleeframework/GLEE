Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2,000,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value and potential.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $2000000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given my initial research, I'd be willing to offer $500000 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my part and would give us a starting point for further discussions. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm afraid it's still below the product's true value. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000. This is a compromise between our initial positions, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1200000 is still a stretch for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer $800000 for the product. This would allow us to both get a good deal and move forward.
