"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great price for a product worth far more to me. I believe it's also a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $1,250,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,350,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I don't want to have to go through any more rounds of negotiation.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
