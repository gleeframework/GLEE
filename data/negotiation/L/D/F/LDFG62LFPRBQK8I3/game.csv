"I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm very interested in the product, though. How about we start with $8,500? That's my absolute top end.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. This is my best compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still above what I can afford right now. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $9,500? This would give us both a good deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $10,500? This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm  trying to work within my budget, and $10,500 is still a stretch for me. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference again and go with $9,750. I believe this is a fair offer, and it's getting closer to where I need to be.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to budge much further. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. I'm not sure how much lower I can go without losing money on the deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to make a final offer. How about $9,250? It's the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",9250.0,Bob,8,
