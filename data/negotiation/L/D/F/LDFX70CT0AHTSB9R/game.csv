"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy if you agree.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
