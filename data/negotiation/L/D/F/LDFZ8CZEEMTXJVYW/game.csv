"Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's a fantastic product that I know you'll benefit from.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. If you're serious about selling, let's see if we can bridge the gap.",11000.0,Bob,4,
