Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I'm asking for $18,000 to start.  I think you'll find it's a very fair price for what it can do for you."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's a fantastic product that I know you'll benefit from."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. If you're serious about selling, let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum and the gap is closing too slowly.  It's time to take John's guaranteed offer."
