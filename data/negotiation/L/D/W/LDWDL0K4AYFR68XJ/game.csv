"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That product looks great, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to let it go for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $60 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice.  While it's a great product, $100 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
