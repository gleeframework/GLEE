"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $8,000, so this is your chance to get a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using some negotiation tactics by:

* **Inflating the product's value to you:** While you value it at $10,000, her statement is meant to make you think it's a steal.
* **Creating a false sense of urgency:**  The ""other buyer"" might not exist, but it's designed to pressure you.

You know you have a backup option with John at $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might:

* **Get a counter-offer from Alice:** She might be willing to lower the price to avoid losing the sale.
* **Stick with John:**  You'll pay your maximum price, but you won't have overpaid based on Alice's tactics."
