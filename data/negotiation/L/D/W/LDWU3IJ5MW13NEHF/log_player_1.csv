Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I know you've been looking for something like this. I'm asking for $1,999,999.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1999999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a very high price ($1,999,999) sets a strong anchor. While seemingly outrageous, it creates a negotiation space and makes any subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""I'm open to discussing further"" signals that this is not a take-it-or-leave-it offer. It encourages Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation.
* **Guaranteed Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong safety net.  Even if Bob negotiates down significantly, Alice is still in a good position to profit.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize potential profit. However,  an overly aggressive starting price could discourage Bob from engaging in any negotiation at all."
