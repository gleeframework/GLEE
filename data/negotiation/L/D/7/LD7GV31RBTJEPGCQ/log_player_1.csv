Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I believe it provides significant value at this price and would be happy to answer any questions you might have."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum selling price ($15,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, increasing our potential profit.
* **Secure a Sale:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays or complications that might arise from waiting.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while still securing a sale and maximizing our profit."
