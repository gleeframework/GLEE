"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant price.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation as Alice's minimum acceptable price is likely much lower than $1,200,000.
* **Buying from John is a fallback:** John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail. 

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, Bob can start the bargaining process and try to get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** This offer is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about negotiating.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and see if she's open to a deal closer to her minimum value.
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  $900,000 is still a good profit for Alice and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
