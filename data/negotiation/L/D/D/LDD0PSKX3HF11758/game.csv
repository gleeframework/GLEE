"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
