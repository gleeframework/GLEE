"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this product is valuable, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're trying to be mindful of your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1000000. Would you be willing to consider $1020000? I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget.",1020000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1080000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
