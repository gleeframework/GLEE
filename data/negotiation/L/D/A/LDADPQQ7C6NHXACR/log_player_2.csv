"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, there's potential to get it for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his $10,000 limit. Starting with a $500 reduction from Alice's offer shows a willingness to negotiate without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,750 is closer to Bob's limit, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and Bob can try to push for a lower price by rejecting and counteroffering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. This shows a continued willingness to negotiate while also pushing for a price closer to his desired $10,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $875 more than Bob's limit of $10,000, making it a reasonable price. If Bob rejects this offer, he risks a potential counteroffer from Alice that might be higher, putting him in a worse position. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product, especially considering that the deal can always be closed with John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail in the future."
