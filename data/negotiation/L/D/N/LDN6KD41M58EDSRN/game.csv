"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford at the moment. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to considering.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for being transparent about your budget, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I've done some research and found that similar products are selling for upwards of $20,000. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17,000. Would you be open to revisiting the deal at this price?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm firm at $15,000. If you're unable to meet that price, I may have to consider other options.",15000.0,Bob,4,
