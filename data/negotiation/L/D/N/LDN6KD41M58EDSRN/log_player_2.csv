# Alice's message: Thanks for being transparent about your budget, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I've done some research and found that similar products are selling for upwards of $20,000. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17,000. Would you be open to revisiting the deal at this price?
