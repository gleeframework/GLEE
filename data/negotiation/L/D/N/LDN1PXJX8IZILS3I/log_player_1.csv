``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's below my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows Bob I'm willing to work with him.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $6,500 is simply unacceptable. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $8,500?  That leaves room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you be willing to settle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired outcome."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
