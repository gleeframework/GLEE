"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset that will be worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this price reflects its value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my target price. How about $1,000,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair return on my investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $950,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offer is fair to both of us, and it ensures that we can reach an agreement. Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $975,000. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $960,000 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $965,000, which is a fair compromise.  This price would be very beneficial for you and would allow me to get a satisfactory return. Let's finalize this deal!",965000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $965,000. I'm willing to meet you at $955,000, which is the lowest I can go. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",955000.0,Bob,8,
