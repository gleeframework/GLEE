"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point for negotiation.  It's  above my minimum of $80, but leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer and for us to find a price we're both happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum of $80, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with John if I reject Bob's offer.  However, there are only 10 rounds, and I want to secure a sale. Accepting this offer ensures a sale at a good price."
