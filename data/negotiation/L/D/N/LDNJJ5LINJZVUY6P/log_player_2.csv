"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get an exclusive product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, you can potentially do better.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can negotiate a lower price closer to your $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my target price of $10,000. I will continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal.  I still have several rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $10,750?  I'm confident this price is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is a fair price that I hope we can agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're not getting any closer to a price I'm comfortable with.  It's getting close to the end of the negotiation period, and I don't want to risk ending up with a price I'm not happy with.  I'm better off buying the product from John for $10,000, which is within my budget."
