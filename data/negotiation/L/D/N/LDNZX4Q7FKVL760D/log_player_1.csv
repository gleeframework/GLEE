Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it at $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks valuable, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm thinking closer to $6,000 would be a more reasonable starting point.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for being open to discussion. I understand your budget concerns, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I believe that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair offer, reflecting both the product's value and my budget limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $7,500 is still significantly lower than what I had in mind. To make this work, I could go down to $9,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
