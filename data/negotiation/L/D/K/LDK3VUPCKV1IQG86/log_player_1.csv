Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and can deliver significant value.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's discuss further and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This price is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I profit from the sale.
* **The message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value while setting a positive tone for the negotiation. 

This approach allows me to:

* **Start strong:**  By offering a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, I establish a firm position.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This price allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, creating a negotiation process.
* **Maintain a positive relationship:** The message keeps the negotiation amicable, which is important for potential future transactions.

By monitoring Bob's responses and being prepared to adjust my offer, I aim to maximize my earnings while still reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below my initial offer of $1,400,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.  

Therefore, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still allows me to make a fair profit and shows my commitment to working with you.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer price:** $1,350,000 is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Message:** The message remains positive and emphasizes mutual benefit while clearly stating my position.

This counteroffer strategy aims to:

* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  By lowering my price, I signal my interest in finding a deal.
* **Maintain leverage:**  The price is still above Bob's offer, reminding him of the product's value.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** The message encourages further discussion and keeps the door open for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still lower than my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price and represents a significant improvement over his previous offers.  

Considering the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a deadlock, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most prudent choice. This allows me to secure a sale and earn a decent profit, rather than risking a lower price or potentially losing the deal entirely."
