"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $18,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he may be willing to pay a little more.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his last offer.  It also gives me some breathing room to negotiate further if needed, while still ensuring I get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher in the next round. I'm not quite ready to settle for $14,000 when I know I can get at least $15,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

This is my final offer. It's my minimum acceptable price and aligns with John's offer. I'm hoping Bob will realize it's a good deal for him and accept. If he rejects, I'll go with John's offer to ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed profit."
