"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's not worth buying the product for $18,000 when you have a better alternative with John.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows for potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above my maximum price.  I'm hoping to find a compromise within a few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's getting closer. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing willingness to compromise. Hopefully, this gets us closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

This is a good deal for me. It's my maximum price, and it's better than buying from John.  Let's close this deal!"
