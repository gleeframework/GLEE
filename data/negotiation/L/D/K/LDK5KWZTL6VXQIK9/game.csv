"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $8,500.  This would allow me to make the sale while still giving you a significant discount. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
