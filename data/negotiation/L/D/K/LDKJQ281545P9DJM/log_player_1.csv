Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. $9,000 is too low for me, and I think we can reach a better deal. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now. I'm prepared to offer $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my minimum.  I'm happy to accept this deal, as it's a good outcome for both of us."
