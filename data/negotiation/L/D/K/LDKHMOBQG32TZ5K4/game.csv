"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $75. I believe it's a bit high at $100, considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider my offer and see if we can meet in the middle?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value, and I appreciate your input. After careful consideration, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $90. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle while still reflecting the value we place on our product. I hope this proposal works for you, and please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming back with a revised price. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90, as I think there's some room for negotiation. Would you be willing to meet me at $82? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",82.0,Bob,4,
