"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $100 by you. Considering its quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $95 for it. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a great value compared to the market price. I believe this is an opportunity not to be missed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is lower than John's price of $100, it's still above your $100 budget. You can use John's offer as leverage. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might prompt her to propose a lower price closer to your budget in a second attempt to make a sale."
