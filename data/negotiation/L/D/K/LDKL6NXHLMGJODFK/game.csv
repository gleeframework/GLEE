"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the price I can get from another seller, and I'm not sure I can go higher than that.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $80 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price, considering the value I'm offering.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. $85 is closer, but I'm still a bit too far from what I need to make this deal work. How about $90?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it's a good compromise.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to go up to $82.50, but that's as high as I can go.",82.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $82.50 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  How about we meet in the middle again at $86.25? This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.",86.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $86.25. I'm willing to go up to $82, but that's as high as I can go.",82.0,Bob,8,
