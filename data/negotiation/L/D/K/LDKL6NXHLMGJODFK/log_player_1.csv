"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the price I can get from another seller, and I'm not sure I can go higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  While $80 is better than nothing, I am confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $80 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price, considering the value I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. $85 is closer, but I'm still a bit too far from what I need to make this deal work. How about $90?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it's a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to go up to $82.50, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. While $82.50 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll aim for a higher counteroffer in the next round.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $120, so I'm not under too much pressure to close a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $82.50 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  How about we meet in the middle again at $86.25? This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 86.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $86.25. I'm willing to go up to $82, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While I would have liked to get a higher price from Bob, we've reached a point where further negotiation with him is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. Given the time constraints and the certainty of John's offer, it's best to secure the $120 sale now."
