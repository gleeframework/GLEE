Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $150, leaving room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a sense that the product has value, making him more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $175.  This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product higher than Bob's initial bid."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $160. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a significant improvement over his initial offer, and more than I would get from John.  It's also likely that further negotiation would result in a lower price, so I'm choosing to close the deal."
