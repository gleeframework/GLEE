{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value, but not too high:**  Bob values the product at $100, so this price leaves room for negotiation. It's likely he'll counteroffer, giving you a chance to meet in the middle.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you'll still make a profit, even if Bob accepts immediately. 
* **It's a strong opening:**  By starting high, you set a baseline for the negotiation and demonstrate confidence in your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find the product for a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $150.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $140? That's still a good price for a product like this, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've looked into the product further and found that $130 might be a more reasonable price for both of us. This allows you to maintain a decent profit while still being competitive in the market. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $130 is above my minimum of $150. This allows me to make a profit and avoids the risk of having to sell to John at a lower price."
