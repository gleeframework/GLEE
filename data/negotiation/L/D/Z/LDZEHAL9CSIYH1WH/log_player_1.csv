``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if Bob doesn't accept. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This is still a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $10,000.  Would you be willing to settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference. How about $11,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to sell the product without losing too much profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're getting closer! I could do $11,200.  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $12,000, I will take the safe route and sell to him.  It's better to secure a sure profit than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
