"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This is still a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let's try to make this work!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference. How about $11,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to sell the product without losing too much profit. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
