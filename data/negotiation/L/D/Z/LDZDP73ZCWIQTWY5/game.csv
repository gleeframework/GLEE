"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done.",145.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $130. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $137.50? This feels like a fair compromise that's closer to both of our desired prices.",137.5,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $137.50. I'm willing to meet you at $135. Can we try to find a middle ground?",135.0,Bob,6,
