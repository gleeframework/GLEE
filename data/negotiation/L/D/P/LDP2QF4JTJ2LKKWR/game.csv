"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $850000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'm interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $1000000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable figure.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair value considering the product's rarity and uniqueness. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $875000. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
