"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth negotiating to try and save more money. I don't know Alice's minimum acceptable price, so it's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can reach a better deal."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $850,000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'm interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $1,000,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable figure."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair value considering the product's rarity and uniqueness. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to keep negotiating to try and get a better price. There's still room for compromise, and I'm not yet ready to resort to buying from John at a higher price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting close, but I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $887500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is close to my counteroffer of $875,000.  It's a good price considering my maximum budget and the potential of further negotiation. While I could try to haggle further, the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer minimizes my risk and secures the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
