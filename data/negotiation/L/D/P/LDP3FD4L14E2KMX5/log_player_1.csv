Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're guaranteed to make a profit of $250,000, which is better than selling to John.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a strong starting point:** You're demonstrating you know the value of the product and you're not afraid to ask for what you deserve.

Remember, the negotiation is a dance, and your next moves will depend on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get a higher price from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that to me, and I'm confident it will be worth even more to you in the long run.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it still allows you to make a substantial profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Justification:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm not completely shutting the door.  My counter-offer provides a clear reason for rejecting his price (""too low"") and outlines the value of the product. 
* **Compromise:** While my counter-offer is still higher than Bob's last offer, I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my original offer. 
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm emphasizing the long-term value of the product to Bob. This could potentially influence his decision. 

I'm taking a calculated risk by keeping the negotiations open.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to weigh my options again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,150,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below what I'd prefer, but it's a significant improvement from his previous offer.  Considering:

* **The risk of further negotiation:**  The longer we negotiate, the greater the chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with John's offer.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While I could counter-offer again, I don't believe I can push Bob much further.
* **The profit margin:**  $1,075,000 is a solid profit for me, and it's still a good deal for Bob.

It's time to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
