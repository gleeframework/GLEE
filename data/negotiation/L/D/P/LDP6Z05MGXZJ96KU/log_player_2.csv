"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While $10,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you since it's more than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,500, which still gives you a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price."
