Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the message as a potential benefit to Bob, highlighting the product's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to my $12,000 minimum as possible.
* **Be Flexible:** I'm willing to negotiate but won't go below my minimum.
* **Have a Backup:** John provides a safety net, allowing me to walk away if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you since it's more than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than the product's value to him, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer.
* **John provides a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the option to sell to John for a much better price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll use a strategy of gradually decreasing my counteroffers until we reach a compromise or I decide to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,500, which still gives you a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer. This shows flexibility while keeping the negotiation within a reasonable range.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" Bob would be getting at $9,500, making the offer more appealing.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:** I'm not closing the door on further negotiations, leaving room for a possible compromise.

**Strategy:**

* **Gradually Decrease Price:** I'm strategically decreasing my price, hoping to find a point where Bob is willing to compromise.
* **Monitor Bob's Reaction:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **John is the Safety Net:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000, giving me the confidence to negotiate more aggressively."
