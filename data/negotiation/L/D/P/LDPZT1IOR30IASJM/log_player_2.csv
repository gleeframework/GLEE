* **Rejecting allows you to control the negotiation.** By rejecting, you can set the counter-offer and guide the negotiation towards a more favorable price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more than $900,000. Considering the value this product offers you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's make a deal before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```
