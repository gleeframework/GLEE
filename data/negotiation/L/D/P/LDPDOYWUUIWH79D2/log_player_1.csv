Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Understanding Value:**  We know the product is worth considerably more to Bob ($15,000) than it is to you ($8,000). This price point aims to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on it.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed if Bob rejects the offer. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
