Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $9,000, so I'll offer you $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
