"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However,  $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,000 is closer, but still a little too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000? That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $9,000, so I'll offer you $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
