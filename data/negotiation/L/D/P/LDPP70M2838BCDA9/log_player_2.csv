"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial value, you can get the product for a guaranteed $100 from John.  Since your goal is to save money and the product is only worth a maximum of $100 to you, buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
