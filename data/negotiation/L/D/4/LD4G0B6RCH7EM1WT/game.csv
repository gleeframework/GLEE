"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking something closer to  $750,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the response.  I understand your perspective, but $750,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. Let's find a middle ground - how about we agree on $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This seems like a fair price to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
