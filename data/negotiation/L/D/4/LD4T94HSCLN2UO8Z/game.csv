"I appreciate your offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront with your budget. I can't come down to $12,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $15,500? That's still a good deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $13,500 is still quite a bit below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $14,500? Let's find a price that works for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles here.  $13,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $14,000?  That's the absolute lowest I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on to other offers.",14000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're making a final concession, but I'm still not comfortable going above $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $14,000. How about $13,500? Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,8,
