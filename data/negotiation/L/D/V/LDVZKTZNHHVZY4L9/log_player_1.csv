Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I'll see if I can get a better price from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000.  Let's find a middle ground to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, and I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle on $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll try to counter Bob again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. I'm still not comfortable with $775,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers at $812,500. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 812500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, compromise is key. To make this happen quickly, I'm willing to offer $790,000.  That's a significant jump on my end, and I'm hoping we can close the deal with this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $790,000 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  John's offer is just slightly better, and I'm worried about continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially losing both deals. It's time to secure the sale to John and move on."
