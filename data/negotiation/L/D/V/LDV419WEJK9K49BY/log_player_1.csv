Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, we can continue bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to make a sale, $100 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer to try and find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $115 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for my budget. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go that low.  I'm confident John will pay my minimum price, so I'll sell to him."
