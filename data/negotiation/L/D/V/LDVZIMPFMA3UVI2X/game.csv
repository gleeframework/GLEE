"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could let it go for $1,900,000. This is adjusting significantly while recognizing the inherent value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but that price is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe that's a fair deal considering its value to me. ",700000.0,Bob,4,
