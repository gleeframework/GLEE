"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10,500. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  While I value your interest, the product is worth more to me than $10,500. Could you meet me halfway at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",11500.0,Bob,4,
