Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price higher than $10,000.
* **Justification:** While I haven't explicitly stated why the price is higher for Bob, the message hints at additional value he might be getting. This could be due to faster delivery, additional services, or simply the fact that he's the preferred buyer. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, John is a guaranteed buyer at $10,000. This knowledge gives Alice the confidence to aim higher with Bob."
