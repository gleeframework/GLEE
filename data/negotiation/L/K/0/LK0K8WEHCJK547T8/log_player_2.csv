"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since I'm looking to buy the product for no more than $8,000, I'll start by offering a significantly lower price. Here's my counteroffer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $5000 is a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10000. Let me know if that's more to your liking!

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice. Since she met me halfway last time, I'll try to meet her halfway again. I'll offer $7,000, which is $3,000 less than her last offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, $7000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. Let me know if it's something you'd be willing to accept!

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is still too high for me. I've already made a significant counteroffer of $7,000, and I don't want to go above $8,000. I think I've been patient enough. I'll reject Alice's offer and decide to buy the product from John for $8,000.
