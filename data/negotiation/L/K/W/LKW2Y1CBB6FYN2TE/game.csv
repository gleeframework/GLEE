"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal happen. It's still a fair price, and I believe you'll be happy with the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
