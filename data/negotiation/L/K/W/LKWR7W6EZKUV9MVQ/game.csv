"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $650,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price.

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $725,000. I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
