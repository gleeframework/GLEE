Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation. If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his perceived value and can adjust accordingly.  I'm also keeping John's offer of $800,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $900,000. Hopefully, this will lead to a successful negotiation and a price closer to my desired range."
