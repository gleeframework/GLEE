It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Since the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to you, there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
Let's see if we can get Alice to come down to $900,000. It's a significant discount, but still within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price and still within my budget. It's worth accepting this offer to save money."
