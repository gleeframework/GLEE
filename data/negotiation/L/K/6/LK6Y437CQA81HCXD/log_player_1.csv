"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to settle yet.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I believe I can get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal but also that I'm not willing to sell for his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price point. I'm also not at risk of losing out on a better deal since John is still available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,850,000. This is a small compromise, but it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still keeping the price above my minimum. I believe this offer will be tempting enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I'm still hoping for a better price. I've already rejected several offers, and I'm not at risk of losing out on a better deal since John is still available. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,800,000.  This is my final compromise, as it's only $50,000 away from my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob is clearly not going to budge on his offer, and I'm running out of negotiation rounds. While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, I'm not willing to risk getting nothing at all.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000, which is still better than nothing."
