Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, but still leaves you with a healthy profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  This offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a substantial gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below what the product is worth to you. Rejecting his offer allows for further negotiation and a potential higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows a willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a respectable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum price.  While you would ideally get more, accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially result in a higher price, but it also risks Bob walking away or you deciding to sell to John."
