Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is not as high as you claim. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still below the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Although Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement.  John is a safe option, and his offer is more than acceptable.  I will sell the product to John."
