"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $16000?  This is still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $14000? I think that's a fair price for this product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $14000 is still a bit low.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about $15000? This price is fair for both of us and will allow us to close this deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,
