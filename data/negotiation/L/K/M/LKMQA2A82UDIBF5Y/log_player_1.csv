Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high. Offering a price significantly above Bob's perceived value allows for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Justification:**  The message frames the price as reflecting the product's ""worth and potential,"" subtly suggesting it might be worth even more in the future.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains open to discussion (""What do you think?""), implying a willingness to negotiate if Bob counters.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:**  A high price will reveal if Bob is truly invested or just fishing for a bargain.
2. **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob accepts, you significantly exceed your minimum.
3. **Leave room for negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial price, you can gradually lower it, knowing your fallback option is secure."
