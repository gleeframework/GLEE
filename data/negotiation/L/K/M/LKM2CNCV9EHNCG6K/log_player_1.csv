Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than what it's worth to you.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  There's room for negotiation, and Bob has a strong incentive to accept. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** The message makes it clear you're open to finding a mutually agreeable price. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response, and you always have the option to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent offer and above your minimum, you still have room to negotiate with Bob. You're aiming for a higher price, and Bob has already indicated he's willing to pay more than his initial counteroffer.  By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer and attempt to bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget. While $9,000 is appreciated, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer.  How about $10,500? It's a fair compromise and still leaves some room for you to get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is closer to your original price:**  It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate, but you're not conceding too much.
* **Provides a clear reason:** You highlight Bob's budget concerns, suggesting a compromise that benefits both sides.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** The offer is still below Bob's perceived value, leaving space for a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's above your minimum of $8,000 and closer to your desired price point than your previous counteroffer. While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's likely that further negotiation will be time-consuming. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a decent price without risking losing the deal altogether."
