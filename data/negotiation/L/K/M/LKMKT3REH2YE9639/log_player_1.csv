Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, your goal is to get as close to that as possible with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up, while still ensuring you make a significant profit.
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price makes it seem like Bob is getting a good deal, increasing the chance of acceptance."
