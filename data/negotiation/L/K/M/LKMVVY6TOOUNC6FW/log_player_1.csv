Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $18,000?** This is a starting point that is higher than your minimum desired price of $15,000. It allows some room for negotiation while still ensuring you profit from the sale. 
* **Why not go higher?** Going too high risks Bob rejecting the offer outright.  Starting with a reasonable offer is more likely to lead to a successful negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response.** 
* **If he accepts:** Congratulations, you've made a good profit!
* **If he rejects:** You can always offer John the product for $15,000, but you could also consider lowering the price slightly to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
