"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair price.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?  I'm eager to make a deal and believe this would be a mutually beneficial price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
