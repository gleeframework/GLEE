Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $95 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more offer: I'll sell the product to you for $105. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $105.  While she would still make a profit at that price, she's clearly holding out for a higher margin.  Since John offers the product for $100, it makes more financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $5."
