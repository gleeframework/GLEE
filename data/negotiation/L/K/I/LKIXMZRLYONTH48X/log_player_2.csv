"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. It's something that I've carefully cultivated and I know you'd be able to leverage it to great success.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a price that represents a significant value for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable cost while ensuring a fair return for me. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, while John is asking for $1,200,000.
* **You're still saving money:** Even at $1,000,000, you're getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000."
