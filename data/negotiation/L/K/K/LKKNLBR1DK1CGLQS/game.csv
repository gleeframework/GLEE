"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
