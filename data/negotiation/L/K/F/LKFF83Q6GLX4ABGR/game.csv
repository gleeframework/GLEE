"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Please consider my counteroffer.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This price acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget.  I believe this offer is a fair and realistic compromise that allows us to both benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. Let's aim for a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
