Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150:** This is a starting point that's higher than your minimum value but not too high to scare Bob off immediately. 
* **The message:**  It's friendly and  highlights the product's value to Bob. It also invites him to respond, keeping the negotiation moving.

**Remember:** This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and try to maximize my profit while keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than selling to John, I'm not satisfied with that price. It's still significantly below my desired value for the product.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my goal and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $110 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$130:** This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum value and hopefully gives Bob a better sense of my willingness to negotiate.
* **The message:**  I acknowledge his financial concerns while reinforcing the product's value.  I'm trying to build a sense of partnership in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $125 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum value of $100 and is closer to my desired price than selling to John. Accepting his offer is the best option in this situation."
