"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on this fantastic item, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $13000? I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $14500. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for meeting me halfway, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a little hesitant at $14500. Would you be willing to consider $14000?  I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $14250. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal. If not, I'll consider other options.",14250.0,Alice,5,
