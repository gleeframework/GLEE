"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging my value for the product.  However, I'm looking to get a better deal. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $925,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to get a lower price. While $925,000 is a better deal than John's offer, there's still some room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the product's value to me,  $925,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to the value you're looking for.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is the same as her initial offer in Round 1. While Bob could continue to negotiate, it's unlikely Alice will go lower, and the risk of not reaching an agreement and having to buy from John at $1,200,000 is significant. Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product at a good price and avoid the risk of a failed negotiation."
