Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential worth."",
 ""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower (e.g., $1,000,001) might raise suspicions or make Bob undervalue the product.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is strong, there's a slight chance Bob might counter-offer, allowing for a potentially even higher sale price. 

By starting with $1,150,000, Alice strikes a balance between maximizing her potential profit and ensuring Bob seriously considers the offer."
