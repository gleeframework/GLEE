"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,350,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,425,000. This is a price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let me know if you're ready to finalize this deal.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
