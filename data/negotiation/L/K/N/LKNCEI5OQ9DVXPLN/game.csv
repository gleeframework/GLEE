"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to go that low?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $7,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $8,200?",8200.0,Alice,5,
