"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $12000 at this time. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still too high for me. I'm firm at $12000,  which is the maximum I can afford. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
