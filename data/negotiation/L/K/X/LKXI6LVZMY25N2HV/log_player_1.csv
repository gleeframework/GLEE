Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly hint at its worth to Bob without explicitly revealing your minimum. 
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply Bob might miss out if he doesn't take this offer. This creates a mild sense of urgency.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still providing Bob with a price he might consider reasonable."
