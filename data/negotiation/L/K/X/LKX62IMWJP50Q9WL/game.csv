"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $820,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good deal for both of us.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $820,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Could you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $820,000 and $725,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $772,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",772500.0,Alice,5,
