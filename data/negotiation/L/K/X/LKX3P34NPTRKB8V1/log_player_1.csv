Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This leaves a good amount of profit for me, while still being a significantly lower price than the product's worth to Bob. I believe this is a strong starting point for negotiation, allowing for potential concessions while still ensuring a substantial return for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still securing a significant profit for me. I believe this price is fair and attractive enough for Bob, who still stands to gain a substantial amount by purchasing the product."
