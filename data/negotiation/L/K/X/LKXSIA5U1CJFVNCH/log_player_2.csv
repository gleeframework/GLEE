"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer ($110) is less than your maximum price ($120), but it's still higher than John's guaranteed price ($120). 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to get a better deal from John."
