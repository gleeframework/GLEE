,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about $15500? This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $13500 is still too low for me. How about $14500? This is a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
