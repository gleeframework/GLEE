"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's way above your budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as she likely wants to sell the product.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your interest in selling this product, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the value you've placed on it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $1,900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. While it's a slight improvement, it's still over $1 million more than I'm willing to pay. I need to keep pushing for a lower price.  Rejecting her offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially find a more agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which represents a significant investment for me.  This offer is closer to my maximum limit, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering your needs and my ability to pay. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
