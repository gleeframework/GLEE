"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that I believe will be mutually beneficial.  Given its potential worth to you, I'm confident that we can reach an agreement.  Please consider my offer carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity to negotiate a better price or proceed with John if necessary."
