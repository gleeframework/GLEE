Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value and you'll get a high-quality product."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to sell now, I think I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'll see if I can get Bob to move closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,000 is my absolute bottom line.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price. I'm going to try to counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product to you for $8,900. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 8900}

This is a good deal for me.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has been firm in his offer. It's time to accept and finalize the sale."
