Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get the highest price possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I need to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $20 markup ($170) is a reasonable starting point. It allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Direct Approach:**  The message is clear and to the point, emphasizing my willingness to make a deal with Bob."
