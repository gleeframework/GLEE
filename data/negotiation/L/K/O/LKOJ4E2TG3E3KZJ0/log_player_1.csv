Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal and you'll definitely get your money's worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $110, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This gives us room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive, highlighting the value Bob will get, increasing the chance of him accepting or at least engaging in the negotiation. 
* **Room to Compromise:**  A $110 price point allows me to come down a bit and still be above my minimum acceptable price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get a better price.
* **John's Offer:** While John offers a guaranteed $100, I'm still hoping for a better outcome with Bob, as I'm more likely to get a higher price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a small concession by dropping from $110 to $105, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price, making it seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Target Price:**  $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, giving me a higher profit than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate the effort, but I still believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $98 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:** Bob's offer of $98 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation Limit:** While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might keep lowering his offer or reject any further counteroffers.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $100, which is my minimum acceptable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
