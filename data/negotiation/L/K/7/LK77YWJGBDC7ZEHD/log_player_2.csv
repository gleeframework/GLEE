"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $10,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not quite there yet, but I'm willing to make another move. How about we meet at $10,250? I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,250.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, as you have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000."
