"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get the deal started.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $850,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to revisiting the price if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $875,000.  This price is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to accept $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is still a good profit for me, but also reflects the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
