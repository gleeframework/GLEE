"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get the deal started. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $850,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to revisiting the price if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is willing to negotiate, her offer of $925,000 is still too high. I believe I can push for a lower price, given her previous willingness to negotiate.  There are still rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $875,000.  This price is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to accept $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is still a good profit for me, but also reflects the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is closer to my target price and within my budget. Although I might be able to squeeze a little more out of her, there's a risk that she'll get stubborn, and I'll end up having to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to secure a deal at this price than to risk losing the product entirely."
