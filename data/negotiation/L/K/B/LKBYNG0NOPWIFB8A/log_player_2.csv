"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product at a price that's significantly below its true value. I understand it's worth $800000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for just $900000.  This is a chance to acquire a valuable asset at a discounted rate.  Consider this a win-win situation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's still above his maximum budget of $800,000. He can get the product for a better price from John."
