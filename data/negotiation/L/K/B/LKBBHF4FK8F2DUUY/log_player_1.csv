Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Proposition:**  The message hints at the product's ""unique value"" to justify the higher price point and create a sense of scarcity with the ""exclusive opportunity"" phrasing. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
