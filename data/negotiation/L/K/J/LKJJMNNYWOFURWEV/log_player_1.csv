Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but it's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm hoping to get close to my desired price, but I'm also prepared to accept a lower offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a drastic reduction from my initial offer.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $175, which is still higher than what Bob offered but shows I'm willing to compromise.  This price is a good middle ground and hopefully encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in further negotiation as I can sell to John for the same price.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum price without risking further negotiation."
