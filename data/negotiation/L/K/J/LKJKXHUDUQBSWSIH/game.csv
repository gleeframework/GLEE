"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and provide a significant return on your investment. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  I've had substantial interest from other potential buyers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still not convinced it's the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still below my bottom line.  To be fair, I'm willing to accept $1,325,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I need to be closer to my target. I'll offer $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
