"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $11,000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first. $11,000 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation. This leaves us space to potentially meet in the middle if Alice is unwilling to go that low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming lower.  Let's see if we can get a bit closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $9,750? I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between our last offer and her counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal and introducing a sense of urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer it to you for $10,200. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $10,000.  While we could push further, $10,200 is a reasonable price and a good saving compared to John's offer.  It's time to accept and secure the deal."
