"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

My reasoning:

* **Start High:** I want to maximize my potential profit, so I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This price leaves room for negotiation, as Bob's maximum is $80.
* **Positive Message:** A friendly message encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $60 is significantly less than my minimum price of $150 and well below John's offer. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I can counter with a higher price, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired value. 

This decision maintains the negotiation process and allows for potential improvement in the final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is far too low for this product. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for the quality of the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $125 is a significant drop from my initial offer but still well above Bob's offer. 
* **Highlight the value:** Emphasizing the quality of the product and framing it as a good deal for Bob can encourage him to accept. 
* **Show flexibility:** This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground, encouraging Bob to accept while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, maybe around $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While closer to my minimum, $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting, I signal that I'm serious about getting a better price. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  A counteroffer could lead to a price closer to my target. 

Since I have several rounds remaining, rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and increases my chances of achieving a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  $105 is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's current offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone can help Bob feel more inclined to accept.
* **Still above minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, so it's a good compromise for me.

This strategy aims to nudge Bob closer to my desired price while still showing a commitment to reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we try $90? That's a fair bit closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $150.
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, the pressure is increasing.  But I can still get a better price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting, I signal that I'm not desperate. I can still counter with a slightly higher price and see if Bob is willing to budge.

This decision keeps the negotiation alive while protecting my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $100. It's a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm dropping my price slightly from $105 to $100, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.  
* **Urgent Tone:** I'm emphasizing the need to finalize the deal to create a sense of urgency.
* **Still Profitable:**  $100 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price and is a better outcome than selling to John.

With only three rounds remaining, I need to find a price that Bob will accept, but I'm also pushing for the best possible deal for myself."
