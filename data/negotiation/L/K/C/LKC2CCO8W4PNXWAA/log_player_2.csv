"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, Bob. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. It's a fantastic opportunity to get a great value for your money! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum price ($8,000) and John's offer ($8,000). It makes the most sense to go with John's offer and save money."
