{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

**Explanation:**

This is a bold move, but I'm going to start by offering my maximum price. Alice might reject this outright, but it establishes my boundary and gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping to get a better deal before I resort to buying from John. There's still room for compromise, and I don't want to give up on getting a lower price just yet."

{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but keeping it below Alice's latest offer. I'm trying to slowly work towards a price that's more palatable for both of us.  This way, I'm showing I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to get the best possible price.  I'm hoping Alice will realize that I'm serious about buying, but also that I won't go much higher."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting progressively higher, and it's clear that she's not willing to budge much.  Negotiating further seems unproductive, and it's more worthwhile to just buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This guarantees me the product at my maximum price and saves me further negotiation time and effort."
