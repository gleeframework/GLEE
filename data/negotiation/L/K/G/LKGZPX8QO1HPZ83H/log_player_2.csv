"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a price of $20,000. I believe it will be very valuable to you, and this is a fair price for its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is way above his budget and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $16,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. Bob should try to negotiate further. He knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John, so he has room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about $14,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it's the most I can afford right now."", ""product_price"": 14000}
