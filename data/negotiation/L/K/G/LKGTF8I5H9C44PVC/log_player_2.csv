{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You should reject Alice's offer. You're aiming for a price closer to $80, and $120 is still too high.  You'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer. While $100 is better than her first offer, it's still higher than your target price of $80. You have more rounds to negotiate and can likely get a better price."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

You've reached a point where the negotiation is taking too long and Alice's offer is still not close enough to your target price.  You're better off cutting your losses and buying the product from John for $80. You've already made a significant attempt to bargain with Alice, and further negotiation is likely to be unproductive."
