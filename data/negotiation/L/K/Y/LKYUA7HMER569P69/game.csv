"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see that you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell it to you for $160. Is that a price you'd be comfortable with?",160.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $155. I can offer you a slight compromise at $165, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,,
