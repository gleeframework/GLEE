"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $115. If you're willing to accept that, I'm happy to buy it now. ",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $135? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",135.0,Alice,5,
