Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room:**  While $1,200,000 is a significant markup, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, giving me space to accept counteroffers.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and motivate him to negotiate. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net and limits my downside risk. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiations open and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling the product to me for $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.**  Accepting would result in a loss for me.
* **Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.** Even if Bob doesn't budge much, I'll gain more negotiation leverage by showing I'm not willing to accept a below-value offer.
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I want to explore if I can do better with Bob.**  I have room to negotiate before I need to resort to John. 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I acknowledge the value you see in the product, $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a Reasonable Range:** My counteroffer is $100,000 higher than Bob's offer, which is a reasonable margin for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the value the product holds for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Flexibility:**  By dropping to $1,050,000, I'm showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm encouraging a quick decision by suggesting the deal is still a great one. 

This counteroffer positions me for a successful negotiation. It's a compromise, yet it maintains my profitability while keeping Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and while I appreciate the reduction, I still believe we can find a middle ground. Could you consider selling the product to me for $1,000,000? This would allow us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit.
* **No More Room to Negotiate:** Further negotiation may not lead to a better price, and could risk losing the deal entirely.
* **John's Offer is Equivalent:** Selling to John for the same price offers no additional benefit.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I achieve my goal of maximizing my earnings."
