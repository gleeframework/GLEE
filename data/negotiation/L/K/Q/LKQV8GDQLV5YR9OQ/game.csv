"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go as low as $10,000, which is the minimum I can sell it for. This is my final offer, and I'm not budging from here. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
