"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $140 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $155? That's still a great price considering the value of the product.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $150? This would allow me to buy the product and you to get your asking price.",150.0,Bob,4,
