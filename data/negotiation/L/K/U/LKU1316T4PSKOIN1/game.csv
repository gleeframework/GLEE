,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,800 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,200.  This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,200, which is $10,000. That's the best I can do. Is that acceptable to you?",10000.0,Bob,6,
