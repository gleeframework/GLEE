"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me a strong starting point for negotiation and allows for potential compromise if Bob counters. It's also above my minimum value of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose out on the deal right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to negotiate further to get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and hopefully find a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm offering $1,700,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  It shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's a slight improvement, it's not close enough to my minimum. I'm going to counter again and try to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,400,000. This is a significant concession, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal. I'm also getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I hope this offer will finally convince Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I need to keep pushing for a better deal. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,300,000. This is getting closer to my minimum, and it's a substantial compromise.  Hopefully, this final concession will convince Bob to accept. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation.  While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made significant concessions, and with only two rounds left, I don't believe I can get a significantly better offer from Bob.  

Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees a sale above my minimum and ensures I don't risk getting a worse deal in the final rounds with Bob."
