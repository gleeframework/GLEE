You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There are 9 rounds left, so there's time to explore options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  I've made a significant counteroffer, aiming to push Alice closer to my desired price point.

* **Focus on Compromise:**  My message emphasizes a desire for a mutually agreeable solution, which can encourage a collaborative approach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to make a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free consultation and a 6-month warranty. Let me know if this is more to your liking.

* **Negotiation Room:** There are still 7 rounds left, which means there's time to further explore options.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I'm hoping Alice will lower her price further, or that I can find a better deal with John if necessary.

**Strategy:**  I'll continue negotiating with Alice, but keep John as a backup option in case the deal with Alice falls through."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer and the extras.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is the highest I can go right now.  It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize this.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1050000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1175000? This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.
