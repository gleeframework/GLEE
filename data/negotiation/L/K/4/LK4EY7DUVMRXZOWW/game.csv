"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to make a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free consultation and a 6-month warranty. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer and the extras.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1050000 is the highest I can go right now.  It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize this.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1050000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1175000? This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm trying to find a middle ground. How about $1100000?  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking $1175000 is still a fair price, but I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a great price. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1150000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1125000, which is the very best I can do.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move on to the exciting possibilities this product offers.",1125000.0,Bob,8,
