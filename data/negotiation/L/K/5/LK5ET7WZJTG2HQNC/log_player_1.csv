"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. $9000 is still a bit steep for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8750? That's a fair compromise, and it's still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,750 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's go with $8,875.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8875 is still just a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8700. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.  Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob has offered to pay $8,700, which is higher than his initial offer, it is still less than my minimum value of $10,000.  I believe that with further negotiation, I can secure a price closer to my target.  I am determined to try and achieve a better deal, as I have a guaranteed sale with John for $10,000 if I need to."
