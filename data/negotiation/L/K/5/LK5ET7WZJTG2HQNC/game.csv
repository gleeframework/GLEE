"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. $9000 is still a bit steep for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8750? That's a fair compromise, and it's still within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8750 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's go with $8875.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8875 is still just a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8700. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",8700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8700 is your limit, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, and offer the product for $8800.  This price is closer to your budget and still allows me to get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",8800.0,Alice,7,
