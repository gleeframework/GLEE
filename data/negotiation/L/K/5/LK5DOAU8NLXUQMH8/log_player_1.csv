"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I still feel that $900,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement closer to my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly anchored at $900,000.  While it's tempting to take the sure profit, we still have room to negotiate and there's a good chance we can get a better price than John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. How about we split the difference between our current positions? I'm willing to come down to $950,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering the value of the product, I think $925,000 would be a reasonable price for us to agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has moved closer to our price and is now offering $925,000. While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of him walking away and losing the deal increases. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit over John's $800,000 offer."
