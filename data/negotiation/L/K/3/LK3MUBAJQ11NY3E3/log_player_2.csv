"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $8,000, and that's the maximum Bob is willing to pay, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to consider other options or negotiate a lower price with Alice in the future."
