"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd save $300,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **Even though the product is worth more to you, it's still a good deal.** You're getting it for $1,200,000, which is significantly less than the $1,500,000 you'd pay John."
