{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:**  This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a substantial discount for Bob, giving him incentive to accept. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. This sets a positive tone and encourages him to engage in the negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm confident this product will be extremely valuable to your business."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I still believe I can secure a better deal. $875,000 is just $75,000 away from my initial offer.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can find common ground.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $875,000. How about we settle on $890,000? It's a fair compromise that acknowledges both of our needs, and I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you. "", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the compromise and emphasizing the investment opportunity for Bob. I'm trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

By proposing $890,000, I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  This could lead to a successful deal in the next few rounds."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to come down to $885,000.  That's a great price for the value you'll get, and it ensures both of us walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 885000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and highlighting that this offer represents a good deal for both parties. This is a persuasive approach that could lead to acceptance.

I believe this counteroffer will put pressure on Bob to accept, as he's likely close to his maximum price. However, if he rejects, I'm prepared to consider selling to John in the next round, as my time is running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $885,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $880,000, which is $877,500. Can we agree on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $877,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $877,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are running out of time, and Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price. Even though I could try to counteroffer one more time, I'm concerned that Bob won't budge further. Selling to John for $800,000 ensures I don't walk away with nothing. This is a strategic decision to secure a guaranteed sale, even if it's not the ideal outcome."
