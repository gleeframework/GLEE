"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a valuable product that can significantly benefit your operations.  While I understand its worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to negotiate.  My asking price is $1,200,000.  This represents a substantial discount from what I could get elsewhere, and I believe it's a fair price that allows for both of us to gain something from this deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
