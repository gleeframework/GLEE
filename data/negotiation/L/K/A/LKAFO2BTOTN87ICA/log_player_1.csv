Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to earn more if Bob accepts a higher price. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $10,000 offers a good balance. It's a significant profit margin for you while still offering Bob a perceived discount and potential value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves some wiggle room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while keeping the backup offer from John in mind."
