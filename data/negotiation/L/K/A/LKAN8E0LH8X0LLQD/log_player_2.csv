Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go much lower than my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is still a compromise from my original price. I'm not sure how much lower I can go without losing money on the deal.

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to come down to a price that's significantly better than John's offer. She's made it clear that $11,000 is close to her bottom line.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially missing out on John's guaranteed $10,000 price."
