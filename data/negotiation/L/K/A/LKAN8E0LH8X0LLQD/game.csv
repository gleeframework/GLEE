"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too wide for me.  I could potentially go up to $9,000, but that's my limit.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is your maximum, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is a significant compromise from my original offer. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go much lower than my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is still a compromise from my original price. I'm not sure how much lower I can go without losing money on the deal.",11000.0,Alice,9,
