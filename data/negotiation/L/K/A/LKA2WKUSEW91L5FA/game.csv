"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $950000 is a bit below what I believe the product is worth.  Considering the product's unique features and potential for growth, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
