Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Margin:** The price is also above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but not ridiculously high.  This makes it seem like a reasonable starting point for negotiations.
* **Motivating Bob:** This offer might encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth exchange that could lead to a mutually agreeable price. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to go lower than my starting price, but I need to secure a more favorable deal.
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range. This will signal that I'm serious about selling but won't settle for an unfavorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:** My counter-offer is lower than my initial price but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin. 
* **Strategic Compromise:**  The price is closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), suggesting that I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. 
* **Creating Pressure:** This counter-offer puts pressure on Bob to reconsider, as he's closer to a price that would be beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still far too low for me, given my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob would likely result in a lower price, and I'm not willing to risk dropping below my minimum.
* **Safe and Secure:** Selling to John guarantees a price that meets my needs and provides a stable outcome. It's not the highest possible price, but it's a sure thing."
