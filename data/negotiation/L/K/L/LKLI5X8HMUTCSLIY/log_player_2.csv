"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly below her product's value to her, it's still significantly more than what John is offering. You can save $1,500 by going with John, and since the product's maximum worth to you is $10,000, John's offer is the best deal."
