"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $9500 for it. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9500 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10000 still doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $11000 as a final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product and is a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,5,
