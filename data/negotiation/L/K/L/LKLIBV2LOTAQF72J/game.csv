"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",200.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $170. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $150. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",150.0,Bob,4,
