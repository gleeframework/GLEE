"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can do much better than $1,200,000. Since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're still within your budget, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you another chance to make a counteroffer. You've already shown that you're willing to go up to $1,100,000, so there's room for a compromise that could be favorable to both parties."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While you could continue to negotiate, Alice's offer is now only $150,000 higher than your last counteroffer. This indicates that you are nearing a reasonable price point, and the risk of continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice getting frustrated and walking away from the deal.  

At this point, accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a price within your budget and saves you the time and potential complications of further negotiations."
