"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's worth discussing a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price?",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $760,000? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",760000.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $805,000. This is as low as I can go.",805000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you're close to your limit.  Let's make it $780,000 and seal the deal. This saves us both time and gets the product in my hands.",780000.0,Bob,6,,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle, but I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $795,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",795000.0,Alice,7,,
