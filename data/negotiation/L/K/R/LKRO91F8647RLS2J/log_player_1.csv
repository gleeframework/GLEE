"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay $15000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $15,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This reflects the exceptional value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 16500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I still believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay $15000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is persistent, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than the previous round, but still above his offer.  I want to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer once again. I appreciate the value of the product, but I still believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay $15000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We are nearing the end of the rounds. While $15,000 is a decent price, I'm not quite ready to give in yet. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, but I'm getting close to the point where I might consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're hitting a wall here. While I value your interest, I need to be realistic about my price.

We're down to the wire and Bob is still refusing to budge.  I've lowered my price significantly from my initial ask, and it's getting risky to keep negotiating. I'm going to sell to John for $12,000. It's not ideal, but it's still better than losing out completely."
