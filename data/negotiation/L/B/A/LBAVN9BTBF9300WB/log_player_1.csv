{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives me a good starting point, and leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't willing to pay that much.  I'll be watching closely to see if he accepts or counters, and I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $11,000. This is a compromise from my original price of $12,000, but it's still above Bob's offer of $9,500. I'm hoping that this will be a more appealing price point for Bob, and we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $10,500 is a good price and it's above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's also better than selling to John for $10,000.  I'm happy to close the deal and move on."
