"I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a discounted price.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of your product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $9,250 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a lower price.  Would you consider $8,750?  I think this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $9,000 again, but I'm not going to go any lower. I'm confident that the product is worth at least that much to you, and I'm willing to compromise on the price. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
