"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, however, the product's value is considerably higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,800,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $700,000 is too far below its value for me to consider. I'm willing to make a significant move to $1,200,000. This offer stands as a final attempt to find a fair deal for both of us. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
