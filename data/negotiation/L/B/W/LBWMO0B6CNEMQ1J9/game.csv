"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $900,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, reflecting its worth to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to consider the minimum value I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to acquiring this product, and I believe $820,000 is a fair price that acknowledges both its value and my budget constraints. This offer is a significant step closer to a deal, and I hope you'll consider it.",820000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I'm willing to meet you at $830,000. This is the lowest I can go while still making it worth my while to sell. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal, and I'm excited about the possibility of working together.",830000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping to get a deal closer to $800,000. Let's compromise at $810,000. This offer is within my budget and closer to what I believe is a fair price.  Let's make this happen.",810000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer within the range we've discussed. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",820000.0,Alice,7,
