This offer represents a significant saving compared to its market value, making it a highly attractive proposition for you. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this exclusive deal. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice.  This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer opens the door for negotiation.**  By rejecting, Bob signals that he's not willing to accept the current price. This might prompt Alice to lower her offer further.

**Next Steps:**

Bob should respond to Alice, politely rejecting her offer but expressing interest in the product. He should then propose a counter-offer closer to the product's value to Alice, perhaps around $900,000 - $1,000,000."
