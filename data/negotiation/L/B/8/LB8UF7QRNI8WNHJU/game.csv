"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still allows for a healthy profit for both of us, and reflects the unique value of the product.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without overpaying.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below the value I need to secure for this product. I'm willing to go a little further and propose $1,000,000. This price is fair, aligns with the product's true worth, and represents a reasonable compromise.  I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal!",1000000.0,Alice,5,
