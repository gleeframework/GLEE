"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a little high for me, though. I'm thinking something closer to $700,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still finding it hard to meet that price.  How about we settle at $760,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us. While $760,000 is closer, I'm proposing $800,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",800000.0,Alice,5,
