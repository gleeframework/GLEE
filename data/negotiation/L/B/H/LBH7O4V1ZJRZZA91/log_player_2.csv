"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While $140 is less than Alice's value, it's still significantly more than your $80 limit and what John offers. You can do better by rejecting and going with John."
