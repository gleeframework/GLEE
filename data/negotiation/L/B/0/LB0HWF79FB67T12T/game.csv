"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm a savvy buyer, and I've done my research on the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference? I'll accept $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do $950,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're committed to $950,000. While that's still below my desired price, I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This would allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. This is my final offer, so let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
