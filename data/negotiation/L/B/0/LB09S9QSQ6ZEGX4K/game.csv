"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $9,500?  That's a good middle ground and I believe it's still a fair deal for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from $11,000 to $9,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
