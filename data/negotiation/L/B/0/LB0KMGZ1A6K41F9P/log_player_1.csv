**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly sticking to a price ceiling around $12,000.  While I could push for more, there's a real risk he won't budge and I'll miss out on a deal that's significantly better than John's offer. Accepting $12,000 ensures a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
