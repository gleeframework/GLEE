"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,500. This is a great compromise that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500, which is closer to my budget and a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $16,500 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $16,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,
