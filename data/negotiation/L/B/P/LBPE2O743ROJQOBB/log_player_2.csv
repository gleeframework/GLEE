"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $10,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than the product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and the price John offers. Rejecting her offer opens the door for you to buy from John at your desired price."
