Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?,15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is there any room for negotiation?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is there any flexibility in the price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. How about we meet in the middle again at $10500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit far apart, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,6,
