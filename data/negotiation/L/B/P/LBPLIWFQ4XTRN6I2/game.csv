"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a very attractive price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you. It's a win-win situation, as you'll be getting a valuable product at a great price, and I'll still be able to secure a profitable deal. Consider this offer carefully, as I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.  ",1200000.0,Alice,1,
