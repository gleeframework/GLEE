"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",10500.0,Alice,3,
