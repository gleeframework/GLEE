"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's no point in accepting the offer or buying from John immediately, as you could potentially get a better deal with Alice through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000.  This sets a clear boundary and forces Alice to decide if she wants to negotiate or accept my offer, which is her floor price. It's unlikely she'll accept this immediately, but it's a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly higher than my budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get a lower price.  I can still get the product from John for $800,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but still remaining within my budget. This should encourage Alice to continue negotiating and potentially come down further in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high.  While this is the best offer she's made so far, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. There's still time to negotiate, and I can always buy from John if I don't get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to increase my offer incrementally, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to go significantly higher than my initial offer. This strategy is meant to gauge how willing Alice is to compromise and hopefully get her closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, but it's getting closer. We're now only $250,000 apart.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to reach a price closer to my maximum budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation, as I can still buy from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly again, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still holding firm to a price within my budget.  This offer is only $75,000 away from Alice's latest offer, so it's a significant step towards a potential agreement. I'm hoping this offer will entice Alice to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
