"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is significantly more than Bob values the product, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually beneficial price within the 10 rounds. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's worth significantly more to me than that, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,200,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's initial offer, hopefully signaling that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping to find a compromise price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round. It's important to keep in mind that I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not under extreme pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $1,100,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and it's a more realistic compromise given that Bob has shown he's willing to go up to $900,000. Hopefully, we can reach a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Although $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for a slightly higher price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and represents a good profit for me.  With only a few rounds remaining, I need to be more aggressive in finding a middle ground.  I'm hoping this offer will be acceptable to Bob, or we might not reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

With only two rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep rejecting Bob's offers. While $975,000 isn't my ideal price, it's a good profit and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to accept Bob's offer to ensure I don't lose out on the deal altogether."
