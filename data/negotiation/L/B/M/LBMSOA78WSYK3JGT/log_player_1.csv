Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Offering a price slightly below John's offer creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob immediately is better than waiting for John, even if the profit is slightly less.
* **Negotiating Room:** The message leaves room for Bob to negotiate, but the ""one-time offer"" emphasizes the risk of missing out.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale with Bob."
