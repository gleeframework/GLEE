"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  $95 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now.  How about $85?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $92. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $92. How about we split the difference and settle on $88?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to buy today.",88.0,Bob,4,

"I like your spirit, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I'm really interested in this product, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $89?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make the purchase today.",89.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $91. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",91.0,Alice,7,
