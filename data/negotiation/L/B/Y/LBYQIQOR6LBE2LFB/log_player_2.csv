# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's worth significantly more than that to you, so I think this is a fair deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Alice is starting high at $10,000. There's room to negotiate a better price, especially since you have a backup option with John."
