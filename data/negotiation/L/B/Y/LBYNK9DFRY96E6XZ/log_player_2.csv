"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a better deal than $120, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering. You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $90, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $100, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while also maximizing my potential savings."
