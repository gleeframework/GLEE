{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a valuable asset that I believe will be highly beneficial to your business.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum price of $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  There's room for negotiation and you leave some potential profit on the table for Bob.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** This lets Bob know you're serious about selling and sets a clear expectation for the negotiation. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** While it's tempting to take $1,300,000, it's still below your desired minimum of $1,000,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** Bob clearly sees value in the product, and his offer demonstrates he's willing to pay a significant amount.  There's likely room to find a price that works for both of you.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** You have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, which gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

You will need to make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your desired $1,400,000. You should consider how much you want to compromise to close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the potential it holds for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows you to achieve significant gains. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but stay above your minimum:** By offering $1,350,000, you are demonstrating flexibility while still staying above your desired $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Highlight the value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value and potential benefits helps justify your price.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** This offer creates an opportunity for Bob to potentially meet you halfway, but also leaves you room to negotiate further if needed. 

Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob break down, providing you with some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I would like to purchase the product, I'm still working within a strict budget. I propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while still allowing me to acquire the product at a reasonable cost. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is only $25,000 below your minimum desired price of $1,350,000.
* **Negotiations are getting difficult:** Bob seems to be holding firm at this price point, and further negotiation may result in a stalemate. 
* **Risk of losing a deal:** If you reject Bob's offer and try for a higher price, you risk Bob walking away entirely. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer at $1,325,000 is the best choice in this situation. It secures a sale close to your minimum desired price and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
