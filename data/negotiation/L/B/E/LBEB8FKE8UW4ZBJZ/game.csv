"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves some room for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both parties.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still too high. I'm prepared to pay $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This price reflects the value I place on the product. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I believe we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
