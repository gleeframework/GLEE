"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, let's meet at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer. How about we settle at $1,250,000? This would save me a significant amount compared to my alternative options and still gives you a great return.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
