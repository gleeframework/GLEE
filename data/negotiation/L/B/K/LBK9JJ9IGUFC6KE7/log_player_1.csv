{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has room to negotiate. 
* **It's a fair starting point:** This shows you're willing to negotiate, but you also value your product. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $13,000 for your product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is still above my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
