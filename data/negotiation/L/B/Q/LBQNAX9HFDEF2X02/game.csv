"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth it.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $87.50. Let's close this deal!",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $89.  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to get the best deal here, and $89 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $88? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",88.0,Bob,6,
