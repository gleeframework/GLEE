"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the potential in this product,  $2,000,000 is unfortunately far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects the value I believe this product will bring to your operations.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident this product is worth something to you, but  I'm not comfortable going above $1,000,000.  Let's work together to bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see you're set on $1,000,000, I have other interested buyers.  To make this work, my absolute lowest is $1,250,000.  This is a final offer - let me know if it's agreeable.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
