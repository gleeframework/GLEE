"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum budget as possible. Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer again gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increasing his offer from $8,500 to $8,750, showing flexibility while still staying within his budget. This counteroffer is a good compromise and may be more appealing to Alice than his previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price.  He's already gone through several rounds of counteroffers, and further negotiation may be time-consuming and lead to a dead end.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for his maximum budget of $8,000, securing the purchase and avoiding potential further delays."
