Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

At this point, Alice has stated this is the lowest she'll go. While $9,000 is closer to my ideal price, I can get the product for $8,000 from John. It makes more financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $1,000."
