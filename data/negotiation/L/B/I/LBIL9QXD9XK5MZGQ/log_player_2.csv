"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,250 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than the price from John ($12,000) and still within Bob's budget.  Since there's no guarantee of getting a lower price in future rounds, it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer."
