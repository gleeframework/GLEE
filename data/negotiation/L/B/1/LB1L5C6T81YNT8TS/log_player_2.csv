"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $950,000 is closer to your maximum than Alice's minimum. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffering makes sense:**  You can try to get a lower price, potentially saving a significant amount of money. 
* **Buying from John is too expensive:**  While a safe option, it's not the most financially savvy choice at this point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's lower than her initial offer, $900,000 is still significantly more than your ideal price.
* **There's room for further negotiation:**  Both you and Alice have moved closer to the middle ground.  Another counteroffer might yield a better price.
* **Buying from John is still too expensive:**  John's offer remains the most expensive option.

By rejecting Alice's offer and sending another counteroffer, you continue to negotiate towards a price that benefits you more."
