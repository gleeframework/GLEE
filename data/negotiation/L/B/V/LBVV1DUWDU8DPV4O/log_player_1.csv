"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This is a strong opening position and will likely lead to counteroffers from Bob. It's important to start strong and see where the negotiation goes from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering $10,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, as I'm willing to sell to John for that amount. If Bob rejects this, I'll move on to selling to John, as there's no further room for negotiation with Bob."
