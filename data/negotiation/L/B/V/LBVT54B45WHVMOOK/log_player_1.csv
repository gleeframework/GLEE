Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has significant value, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,275,000. I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,312,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000, which is the same price I offered in round 4. I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

While I could continue negotiating, Bob seems firmly set at $1,275,000. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiations falling through."
