"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to get a better deal.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'd be willing to go up to $92. Let's meet in the middle, shall we?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $92 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet at $93.  That's a fair compromise, and it'll allow us to make this deal work.",93.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I'd still like to save a bit more. How about $90.50? That's the best I can do.",90.5,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  $92 is my final offer.  If you're serious about getting this product, let's close the deal.",92.0,Alice,7,
