"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8,200. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $8,200 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
