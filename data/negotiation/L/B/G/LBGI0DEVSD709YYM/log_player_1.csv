Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. It's a bit less than my minimum, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll see how much he's willing to offer.  If we can't agree, I'll always have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm interested in selling to him, I'm not willing to drop down to $90.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $105, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm open to compromise and hope to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $95 is still below my desired price, it's closer to my minimum and I'm not sure if I can push Bob higher.  It's better to accept his offer now than to risk a longer negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer altogether."
