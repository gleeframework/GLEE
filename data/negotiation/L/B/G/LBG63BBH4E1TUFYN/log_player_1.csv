Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, trying to secure a higher price from Bob is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting with a price slightly below John's offer ($950,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. It positions the offer as a potential bargain while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message hints at potential flexibility (""initially proposing"") in case Bob wants to negotiate, allowing me to potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
