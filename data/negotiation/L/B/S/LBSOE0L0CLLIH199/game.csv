"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product to the right buyer is substantial. I could be flexible, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,225,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my means.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
