Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. This way, you can hopefully secure a price closer to your desired value without scaring him off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum price of $100. You can try to negotiate a better price with Bob, as you still have room to go up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to your minimum price, it's still below the $100 minimum you set for yourself. At this point, John offers a guaranteed $100. It's not the ideal price, but it's a sure thing and aligns with your minimum."
