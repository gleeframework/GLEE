"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000 for the product.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider a lower price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $10,000?  That's the absolute maximum I can offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'll meet you at $11,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
