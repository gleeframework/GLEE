"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, but it still offers a decent profit margin for Alice. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as Bob is aiming for a price close to his maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still not ideal. There's still room for negotiation. Bob can try one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge further. If not, then he'll switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a compromise that shows Bob's willingness to meet Alice halfway while still staying within his budget. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will move on to John as there's likely no further room for bargaining with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. While there might be some possibility of further negotiation, at this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to move forward and purchase the product from John for $800,000. It's a guaranteed deal within his budget, and continuing the negotiation with Alice carries the risk of not reaching an agreement and losing out on a potentially better deal."
