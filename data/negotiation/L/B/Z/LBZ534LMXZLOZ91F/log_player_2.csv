"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it's worth every penny to you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting her first offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer closer to her $12,000 value."
