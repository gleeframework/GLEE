"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's less than what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

You can get the product from John for $10,000, which is lower than Alice's offer. It's always better to save money when possible."
