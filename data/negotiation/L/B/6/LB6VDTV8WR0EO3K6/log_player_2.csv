"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you, Bob! This is a high-quality product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to get the best possible deal, so starting with a significantly lower offer than our budget ($60 vs. $80) gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message maintains a friendly tone and expresses continued interest in the product. This keeps the negotiation going smoothly.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give us valuable information about Alice's flexibility on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $100 for the product. Can we discuss a price around there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $100 is still too high.  We're getting closer, but we need to show her we're willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  Let's counteroffer again, inching closer to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we try to find a compromise at $70? That's a fair offer considering the value."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're moving closer to our maximum budget ($80) to show Alice we're serious. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the value of the product helps reinforce our offer without being overly aggressive.
* **Seeking Compromise:** The language emphasizes finding a middle ground that works for both parties. This keeps the negotiation positive and solution-oriented."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $70 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $90 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting very close to our maximum budget, but we're not there yet. We're only $5 away from John's price. Rejecting this offer shows Alice we're serious about our price limit and are willing to walk away.  It's a calculated risk, but it could lead to a final offer at our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I can do $80, but that's really the most I can offer.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to make the deal right now if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is our maximum budget.  Being firm and clear about this limit is essential.
* **Sense of Urgency:** We're letting Alice know that this is our best offer and that we're ready to close the deal immediately if she accepts.
* **Alternative Option:** By implying we could buy from John, we're subtly reminding Alice of our other option without directly threatening to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close, Bob! However, I've already had an offer from another buyer who is willing to pay the full price of $80, so I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll meet you at $82.50, and that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to pressure us with a ""final offer"" and a story about another buyer. However, we've reached a point where her price ($82.50) is higher than John's price ($80).  It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed better deal."
