"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $9000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it, which I believe is a fair price given its unique value. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $10500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $11250? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my limits, and I'm confident it would be a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11250. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $11000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
