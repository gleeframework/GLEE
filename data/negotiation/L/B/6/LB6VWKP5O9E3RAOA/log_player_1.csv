""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this is a competitive price."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below John's price creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 provides leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum."
