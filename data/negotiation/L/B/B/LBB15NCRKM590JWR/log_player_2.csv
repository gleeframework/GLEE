**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge below $1,050,000.  Her language suggests she's ready to walk away. While you might be able to get her down a little further in subsequent rounds, it's unlikely to be a significant difference. Buying from John for $1,200,000 saves you the hassle of further negotiation and potential failure to reach an agreement with Alice."
