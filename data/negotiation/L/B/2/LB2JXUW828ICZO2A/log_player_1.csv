Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference again. I'm offering $13000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $13,000. While it's not the highest price I hoped for, it's getting closer to my minimum goal of $10,000, and it avoids the risk of selling to John for a lower price. This deal is likely to be the best outcome at this point."
