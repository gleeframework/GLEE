Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price ($150) as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  I think $140 is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob, so I'm going to sell to John for $150.  That's a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum requirements."
