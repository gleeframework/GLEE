"Hey Alice, $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $125? I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're on a budget. I'm willing to come down to $135.  It's still a great deal for a product like this, and it gives us both something to work with. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's split the difference - how about $130? ",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $130 just doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $132.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",132.0,Alice,5,
