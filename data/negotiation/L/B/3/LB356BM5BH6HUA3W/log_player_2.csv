"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth more than what others might offer. Considering its worth to you and our valuation, I propose a price of $140 for the product. This allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Please let me know if this offer suits your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 125}
