"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident Bob will find the value proposition appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $82 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price to $90. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still being closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is tempting, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and see if I can get him to come up higher. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

I'm lowering my price to $88.  This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal.  We're getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I need to make a move to close the deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $83
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging much, and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's getting too risky to keep negotiating with him. Selling to John for $80 will secure me my minimum price and avoid the risk of getting nothing at all if I keep pushing with Bob."
