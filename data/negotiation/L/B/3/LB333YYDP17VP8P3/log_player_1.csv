Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $15,000. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Here's why I chose this price:

* **Above my minimum:** $15,000 is higher than my minimum of $12,000, giving me some room to negotiate.
* **Not too high:** It's not so high that it scares Bob off immediately. 
* **Open ended:**  The message leaves the door open for discussion and negotiation. 

I'm also prepared to  negotiate further based on Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer."
