"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $12,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
