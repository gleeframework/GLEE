Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with my minimum price point, knowing that John is ready to buy for this amount. This puts the pressure on Bob to either accept or come up with a counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping for. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can come to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $950,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than what Bob is currently offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm willing to accept this to avoid further negotiation and the risk of him backing out."
