I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a fair price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my previous offer. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for him to accept, while still allowing me to make a profit."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below my desired profit margin.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120, ensuring I meet my minimum requirement."
