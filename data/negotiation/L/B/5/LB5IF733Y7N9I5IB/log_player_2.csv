"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth considering at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a great opportunity to secure an item that could be worth $10,000 to you at such a competitive rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is tempting, you can potentially get a better deal. There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate and you're determined to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start counter-offering and potentially get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to secure the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. In light of that, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000 for the product. This still offers a good value for you while allowing us to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to your target price, you are still determined to save as much as possible.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. There are still 7 rounds remaining, and you are confident that you can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,900 for the product. This brings us closer together and still provides a reasonable profit for me while staying within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is only $900 above your target price of $10,000.  This is a small enough difference that it's worth accepting the offer.  You're running out of rounds (only 5 left) and the risk of pushing for a lower price could result in Alice rejecting your offer and you being forced to buy from John at $10,000 anyway.  It's better to secure the product at a price that's only slightly above your target."
