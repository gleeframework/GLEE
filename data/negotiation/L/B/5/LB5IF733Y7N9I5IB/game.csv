"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth considering at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a great opportunity to secure an item that could be worth $10,000 to you at such a competitive rate.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to secure the product within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. In light of that, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000 for the product. This still offers a good value for you while allowing us to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement in this round.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,900 for the product. This brings us closer together and still provides a reasonable profit for me while staying within your budget.",10900.0,Alice,5,
