Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $119. It's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Price:**  We know Bob values the product at $120.  We want to get as close to that as possible without exceeding it, ensuring he sees value in the purchase.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $100. This guarantees we won't go below that price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While we start high, the message's tone is friendly and positions the offer as a ""deal."" This leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to a slightly higher final price."
