"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming for a price below $150. Alice's offer is close, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a $10 reduction from Alice's offer is a reasonable starting point. This shows you're serious about buying but are also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within your acceptable range of $150 or less.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of going another round and potentially ending up buying from John for $150 is too high. It's better to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with."
