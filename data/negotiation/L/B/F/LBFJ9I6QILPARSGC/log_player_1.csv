Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept less from Bob.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal is beneficial for both parties are between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob some perceived value. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 might make him suspicious or feel like he's not getting a good deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Confident:** The message is direct and positions the product as valuable.
* **Strategic Price:**  $1,350,000 is within the ZOPA, giving you a significant profit margin while still being attractive to Bob. 
* **No Justification:** Avoid explaining why the price is this high. Let Bob counter if he wants to negotiate.

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. You could start higher and be prepared to negotiate down.  The key is to be confident in your value and willing to walk away if Bob doesn't meet your needs."
