It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You can likely get a better price than $950,000, especially since Alice is motivated to sell."

It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You're still above your target price, but Alice is showing a willingness to come down.  Let's see if you can get closer to your goal."

At this point, Alice's price is getting closer to your maximum but it's still above your target. There's a chance you can continue negotiating and get a better price, but there's also a risk that you'll get stuck in a long negotiation and lose out on the deal entirely. It's better to go with the guaranteed deal from John at your target price."
