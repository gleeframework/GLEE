# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I know it's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.
