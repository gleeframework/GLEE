"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still gives you a good price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. However, I am still unable to meet you at $11,000. I am willing to pay up to $10,500 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",10750.0,Alice,5,
