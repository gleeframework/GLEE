{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate but leaves some room for you to make a profit.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** You still have room to negotiate down without going below your minimum.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and selling to John would be a better deal. However, there's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum."

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  Selling to John for $12,000 is the better option. However, I want to see if I can negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob before committing to John."
