"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'd be willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $105 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This price is still a good value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
