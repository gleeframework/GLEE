"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to make a good profit while still being a fair price for you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is significantly below what I can realistically accept. Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $900,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle again at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $850,000, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer, as going lower would no longer be profitable for me. Let me know if you're interested.",850000.0,Alice,5,
