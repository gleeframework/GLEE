"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $800,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can both be happy with the outcome.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $775,000? That's the best I can do, but I'm really interested in the product and want to make a deal",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence and interest in the product.  $775,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we split the difference at $787,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product.",787500.0,Alice,5,
