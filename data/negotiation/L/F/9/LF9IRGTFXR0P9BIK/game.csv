"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $130 is a fair price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $142. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot!",142.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $142 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $135.  That's a good compromise and allows us both to get a fair deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can do $139, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not making a profit at $135, and I need to make sure I get a good deal. Let's meet in the middle again!",139.0,Alice,5,
