Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a price closer to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, encouraging Bob to engage.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""starting price"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signals  willingness to negotiate.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. It opens the door for a potentially lucrative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly higher than your fallback option with John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob clearly sees the value in the product (worth $1,000,000 to him) and his counter offer is a good sign he's willing to engage further. By rejecting and countering, you aim to close the gap and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $910,000. This reflects the true value of the product and the benefits it offers.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 910000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By reducing the price to $910,000, you demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** Re-emphasizing the product's value helps justify the higher price and keeps Bob focused on the potential benefits. 
* **Open for Agreement:** The tone remains collaborative, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $880,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is now a strong deal for you. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** You're securing a profit of $80,000 above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate risks alienating Bob. The potential gains from further negotiation are likely smaller than the risk of losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows you to reinvest the capital sooner rather than later. 

While you could push for a slightly higher price, accepting this offer balances risk and reward effectively."
