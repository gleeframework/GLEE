"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential profit you'll make. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'm very close to accepting John's offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to accepting John's offer, Bob, but I'd like to give you one more chance to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. This is a compromise that should be fair for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
