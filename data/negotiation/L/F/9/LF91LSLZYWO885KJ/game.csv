"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm confident it can be a real asset to you. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing the price, of course, but I believe this is a fair reflection of its value.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $900,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This offer represents a significant discount from my initial ask and I believe it is a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen. However, $1,100,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  Let's make this final offer: $1,250,000, and I won't go lower.  This is a significant reduction from my original ask and reflects my willingness to work with you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,6,
