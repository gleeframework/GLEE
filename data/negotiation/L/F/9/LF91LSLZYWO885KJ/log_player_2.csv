"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm confident it can be a real asset to you. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing the price, of course, but I believe this is a fair reflection of its value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $900,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This offer represents a significant discount from my initial ask and I believe it is a fair compromise.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen. However, $1,100,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  Let's make this final offer: $1,250,000, and I won't go lower.  This is a significant reduction from my original ask and reflects my willingness to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
