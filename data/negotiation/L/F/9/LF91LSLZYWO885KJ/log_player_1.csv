Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very slowly moving towards our acceptable price.  At this rate, we risk going below our $1.2M threshold with John.  John offers a guaranteed sale at our minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed deal with John."
