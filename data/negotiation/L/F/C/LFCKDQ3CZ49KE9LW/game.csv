"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8000 doesn't quite cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $9000. How about we try $8500? It's a compromise I'm willing to make to get the product",8500.0,Bob,4,
