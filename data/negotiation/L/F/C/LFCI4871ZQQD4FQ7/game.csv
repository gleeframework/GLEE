"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  How about $10,000?  That's my absolute maximum for this product.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",10200.0,Alice,5,
