Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the significant return you'll see on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and still ensures you don't sell below your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential return on investment,"" you aim to justify the high price, framing it as an investment rather than just a purchase.
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in your offer can make Bob more likely to take it seriously. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can gradually lower your asking price, but never go below $800,000."
