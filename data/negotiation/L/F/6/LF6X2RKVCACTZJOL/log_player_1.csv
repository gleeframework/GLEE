Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While selling to John guarantees $800,000, Bob's higher valuation offers a chance to earn more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and there's still a good chance of settling above the $800,000 fallback.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, justifying the high price and making it more appealing to Bob."
