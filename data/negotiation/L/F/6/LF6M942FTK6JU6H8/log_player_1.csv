{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I'm starting high, aiming to get as close to my minimum desired price ($1,000,000) as possible.  This initial offer serves two purposes:

1. **Establishes a strong starting point:** It sets the tone that I'm confident in the value of the product.
2. **Provides room for negotiation:** It gives Bob space to counteroffer without feeling like he's immediately rejected.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own. However, I'll always keep in mind that I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which gives me a solid fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am interested in purchasing your product for $800,000. Let me know if this is something you can consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  While $800,000 is still a decent amount, I'm not willing to settle for that much, especially since I have John's guaranteed offer for $1,000,000. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $1,000,000 to see if I can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. It's still a great price for a product of this quality. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering with a price of $900,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer of $1,000,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  However, it's still above Bob's offer, leaving room for further discussion.

My goal is to get as close to my desired price as possible while keeping in mind that John's offer of $1,000,000 is always a backup option.  This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm serious about selling the product to Bob but I won't compromise below a certain threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet at $900,000. I would like to propose $850,000 as a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm not willing to settle for that price, especially with John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to close the gap between our offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $875,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering with a price of $875,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's latest offer of $850,000. This shows that I am willing to meet halfway.

By splitting the difference, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still ensuring that I earn a reasonable amount for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I'm not comfortable with $875,000, I'd like to propose $860,000 as a counteroffer. This price reflects the value I place on the product while staying within my budget. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $860,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not quite there.  At this point, I've already engaged in several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely that Bob will budge much further. 

Given that I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, it's simply not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  It's more advantageous for me to sell the product to John and secure the higher price."
