"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. After reevaluating our position and considering your latest offer, I am inclined to meet you halfway. I would like to propose a final offer of $1250000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise that takes into account the value of the product and your budget constraints. I believe this could be a win-win solution for both of us. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above your budget, although it's a significant drop from the original price. However, you've already made your final offer and she rejected it.  You're now at a point where continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to yield a result better than your guaranteed price from John. 

It's time to secure the product at the best price available to you."
