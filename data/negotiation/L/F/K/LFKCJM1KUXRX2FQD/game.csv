"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $950,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",950000.0,Alice,1,
