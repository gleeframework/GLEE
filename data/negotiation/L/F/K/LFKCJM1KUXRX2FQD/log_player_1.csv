{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $950,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Your floor:** You are willing to accept $800,000 from John.
* **Bob's ceiling:** Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation room:** There's a $200,000 gap between your floor and Bob's ceiling, allowing for some negotiation.

By offering $950,000, you are:

* **Maximizing your profit:** You earn significantly more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob has some room to negotiate down if he feels the price is too high, but it's still a very attractive deal for him.
* **Making it a win-win:** If Bob accepts, you earn a good price, and he gets a valuable product. If he rejects, you can still sell it to John and avoid losing out."
