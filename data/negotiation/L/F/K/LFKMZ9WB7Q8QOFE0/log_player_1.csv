Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary and still get a profit. I'm also trying to be friendly and engaging to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit pricey for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer!  $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $72.50? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 72.50}
```

I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still securing a profit.  I'm also reiterating the idea of a fair deal for both of us, trying to emphasize a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $65 might have been a bit low. How about $70? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to take it. While I would prefer a higher price, it's still a profit for me and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
