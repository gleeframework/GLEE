"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still above my minimum value and closer to my initial offer. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also want a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$140 is still below my minimum value, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm offering $160. This is still above my minimum value but shows I'm willing to be flexible. With only 5 rounds left, I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal for me. Bob is offering my minimum price, and I have limited time. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
