"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: $2,000,000 is above your maximum budget. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or go with John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Reason: This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason:  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is within your budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000.  It's likely you won't be able to negotiate a lower price, so accepting this offer is the best course of action."
