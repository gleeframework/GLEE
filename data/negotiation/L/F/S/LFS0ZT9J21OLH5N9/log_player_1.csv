Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a safety net.  
* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting with a price just below Alice's guaranteed sale price creates room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer. 
* **Strategic Wording:**  The message aims to pique Bob's interest by highlighting ""significant value"" without revealing Alice's bottom line.

**Important Note:** This offer assumes Alice doesn't know the exact worth of the product to Bob. If she knew he valued it at $8,000, she might adjust her strategy accordingly."
