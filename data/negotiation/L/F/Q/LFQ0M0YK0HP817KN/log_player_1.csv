"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it allows room for negotiation and leaves me with a margin of profit.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not eager to settle just yet.  I believe there's room for a better deal, so I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm offering $17,500 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, and I'm hoping it will be attractive enough for him to accept. It leaves room for a potential agreement while still guaranteeing a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $16,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a fair deal that ensures a profit for me.  Given the limited rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing a deal completely."
