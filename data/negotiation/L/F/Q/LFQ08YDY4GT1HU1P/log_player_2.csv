"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer because it's still too high for you.  You have a better option with John at $8,000.  You should try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer is still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $12,000, but it's also higher than John's offer of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but also gives Alice a bit of incentive to accept as it's more than your absolute floor price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it is lower than her initial offer, it is still higher than what John is offering. You should attempt to negotiate further with Alice to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 9500}
```

You're increasing your offer slightly from the previous round, but it's still below Alice's current offer. This shows you're willing to negotiate but are also sticking to your budget. Hopefully, Alice sees this as a good middle ground and accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $10,500 is closer to your budget, it's still more than what John is offering. It's worth trying one more round of negotiation with Alice to see if you can get her down to $9,500 or closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 10000}
```

You're making a final attempt to reach a deal with Alice. This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer but still below her latest offer.  This shows that you're willing to compromise but also have a clear limit.  Hopefully, Alice sees this as a fair price and accepts, but if she doesn't, you can always go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has been stubborn, and while her offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still higher than John's.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John.  You've saved $2,250 compared to Alice's final offer."
