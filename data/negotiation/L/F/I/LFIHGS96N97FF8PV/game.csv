"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm looking to save as much as possible, and I'm not sure if the product is worth $12,000 to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a good price, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,
