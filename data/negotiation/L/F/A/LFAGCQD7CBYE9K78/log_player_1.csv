"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  How about $120? "", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You want to get at least $80, so $120 is a good starting point.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of Bob accepting. 
* **It sets a clear expectation:** By starting high, you leave yourself room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is a decent price, it's still below the middle ground between your minimum ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($150).  There's still room to negotiate for a better price.  You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, so rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $100 is still a bit low for me.  How about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a fair price:** $110 is a reasonable counteroffer that is closer to your goal and still allows room for further negotiation.
* **Be polite and firm:**  Expressing appreciation for Bob's offer while remaining firm on your price helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Emphasize the value:**  Remind Bob of the value he places on the product to justify your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $105? That's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to your goal:** $105 is very close to your desired price range, and getting a little more than your minimum of $80 is a good outcome.
* **Good compromise:**  Bob's offer represents a compromise, and accepting it shows a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While $105 isn't your ideal price, you could still try to negotiate further if you reject this offer, but it's risky as you might lose the deal completely. 

It's generally a good strategy to accept a reasonable offer if it's close to your goal, especially since you have limited rounds and a backup option of selling to John."
