# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let you have it for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $110. This means Bob can save $10 by accepting Alice's offer.
* Buying from John would cost Bob $120, which is more expensive than Alice's offer."
