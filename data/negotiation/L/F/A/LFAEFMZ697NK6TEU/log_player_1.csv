{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer gives me a little profit while still being attractive to Bob, who values the product at $12,000.  It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $11,000 is below my minimum threshold of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $11,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11500. How about we meet in the middle at $11250? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $11,250 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold. I'd rather secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with less."
