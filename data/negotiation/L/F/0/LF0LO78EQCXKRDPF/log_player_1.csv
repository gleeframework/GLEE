Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($120 - $80 = $40) while still ensuring Bob gets a perceived deal ($120 - $100 = $20 in savings).

This strategy aims for a win-win situation, maximizing your profit while making the offer attractive to Bob."
