"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1050000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the value I believe the product brings. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1150000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to be fairly compensated, and I'm trying to work within my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1100000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1200000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $1150000.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
