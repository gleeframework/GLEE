Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob seems firm on his valuation and is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,250,000 is a significant profit above John's standing offer of $1,000,000."
