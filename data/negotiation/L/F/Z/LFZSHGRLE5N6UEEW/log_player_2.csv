Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can offer you a compromise: I'll meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still a bit away from what I can afford. How about $760,000? This offer reflects the serious interest I have in your product while staying within my budget."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $760,000 is still a bit below my target. I can offer you a slight discount, bringing the price down to $795,000. This is the closest I can get to meeting your budget without compromising my own profit margin. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $795,000.  Since John is offering the product for $800,000, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal with John and avoid further negotiation rounds with Alice.  The potential savings from Alice are minimal compared to the risk of her not going low enough."
