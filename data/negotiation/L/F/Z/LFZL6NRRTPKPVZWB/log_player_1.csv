{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. My starting price is $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let's discuss."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price of $1350000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price, especially since I have the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $1,350,000 is still a bit below what I can reasonably accept.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,375,000? This allows for a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll still find significant value in the product at this price."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. Given my budget, I would like to suggest a price of $1360000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is very close to my desired price point. While I can still try to negotiate a bit higher, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle with John for $1,500,000 is too great.  This is a good outcome, as it's a win-win for both of us."
