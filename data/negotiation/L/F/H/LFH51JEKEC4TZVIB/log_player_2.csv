"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to you, it's still higher than your target price of $8,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above your target of $8,000. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best way to try and get a lower price.  You are still very close to your target price and have room to bargain."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9750. This is the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,750 is getting very close to your maximum price of $8,000.  You have the option of continuing to negotiate, but the risk is that Alice might end up refusing to go any lower, and you would have to buy from John for $8,000 anyway.

Since there's not much room for further price reduction, it's more efficient to cut your losses and buy from John, securing the product at your target price."
