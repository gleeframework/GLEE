"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $100 for it.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $145. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a discounted rate. Let me know if you're interested!",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  While I appreciate the offer, $145 is still more than I can reasonably spend. I'm sticking to my offer of $100. If you're willing to go that low, we have a deal. If not, I'll have to look elsewhere.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $100, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,5,
