"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1100000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for 850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for 950000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and still allows us to come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's find common ground and finalize this purchase.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that 900000 is still a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for 925000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and still allows us to come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway again to find a mutually beneficial deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. While $925000 is getting closer, it's still a bit too high. I'm willing to go to $910000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. ",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that 910000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for 920000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",920000.0,Alice,7,
