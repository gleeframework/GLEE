"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer,  $8,200 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,800? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $8,800. How about we meet in the middle at $8,600? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I'm willing to make a decision if we can agree on this price.",8600.0,Bob,4,
