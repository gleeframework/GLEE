"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and open to a discussion to gauge Bob's interest and see if I can get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I think $100 would be a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's not worth selling to him at that price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a fair price for the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. Considering the market value, I would like to propose $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's not a great price, but it's better than selling to John for the same amount. Accepting this offer ensures a quick and certain sale."
