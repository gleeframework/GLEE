"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be happy to pay $14000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $14000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference and agree on $15500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
