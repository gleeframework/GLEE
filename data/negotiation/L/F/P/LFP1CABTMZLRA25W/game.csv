"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and sharing your perspective on the product's value to you. I've tried to make my price reasonable, but I can't accept $1,200,000.  How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offer is still quite a ways from what I need to make this deal work.  Frankly, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay me $1,500,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic.  To make this worthwhile for me, I need at least $1,450,000.  This is my final offer.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,450,000. I've already gone as high as $1,250,000, and I'm not willing to exceed that. I'm willing to make one more offer: $1,220,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000.",1220000.0,Bob,6,
