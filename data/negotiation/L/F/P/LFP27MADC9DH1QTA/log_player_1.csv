Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above my minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing the chance of a sale. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, so there's no pressure to go below that price."
