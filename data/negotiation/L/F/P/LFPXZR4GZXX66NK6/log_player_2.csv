"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I propose a price of $100 for it. This is a special offer considering its worth to you stands at $120. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:While Alice's offer of $100 is lower than John's $120, it's still above Alice's perceived value of $80. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I might be able to get a better price from Alice, closer to her actual valuation."
