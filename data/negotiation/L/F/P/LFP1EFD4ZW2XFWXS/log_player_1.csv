""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,500,000, Alice wants to see if she can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * **For Bob:** He gets a $400,000 discount from the product's value to him ($1,400,000 vs. $1,000,000).
    * **For Alice:** She makes an extra $100,000 profit compared to selling to John ($1,400,000 vs. $1,500,000). 

By starting with this high but justifiable price, Alice leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
