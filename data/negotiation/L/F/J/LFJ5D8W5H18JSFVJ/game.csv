"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a steal at this price, and I think you'll be thrilled with your purchase.",200.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $200 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested, but I'd be willing to pay $130.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $175. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $175 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $150. That's my final offer, and it's the absolute most I can do. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $165. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",165.0,Alice,5,
