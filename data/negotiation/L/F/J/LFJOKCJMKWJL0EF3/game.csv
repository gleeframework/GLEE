"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's valued at $1,000,000 for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm asking for $900,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $750,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident you'll find this price to be a great value. ",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'd like to propose a price of $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $750,000, and I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
