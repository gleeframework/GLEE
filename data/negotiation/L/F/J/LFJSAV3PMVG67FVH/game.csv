"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $10,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $10,250. This is still a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",10250.0,Alice,5,
