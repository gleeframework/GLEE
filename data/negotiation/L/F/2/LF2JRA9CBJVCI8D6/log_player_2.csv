"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it aligns perfectly with your needs. I'm offering it to you for $1250000. I understand this is a considerable investment, but I assure you its potential return will be substantial.  Let's discuss this further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm not convinced that the product is worth the full $1,250,000. I'd rather explore other options to save some money. I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,200,000.
