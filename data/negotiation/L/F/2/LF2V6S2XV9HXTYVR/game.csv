"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to own a unique product. I think you'll really love it, but I need to be upfront with you - it's worth at least $12000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,1,
