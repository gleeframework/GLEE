"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1500000. This is a fair price considering its unique features and benefits.

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share such a unique item. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1400000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that the product's value is worth more to you than $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my initial price. My counteroffer is $1600000. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, I must respectfully decline at $1600000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1450000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1450000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1450000 and $1600000, which is $1525000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a great deal for both of us.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
