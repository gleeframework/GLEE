"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to pay closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to $11,000. This shows flexibility and could encourage Bob to come up in his offer. I'm still confident that I can get a better price than $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Even though we're at my minimum, I'm going to try one more time to get him to budge.  I have 6 rounds left and don't want to give up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

This is my final attempt to get a price closer to my desired value. I'm dropping the price to $10,500, making it a more attractive offer for Bob. If he still refuses, I'll have to consider selling to John."
