"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $16,500? I believe that's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,500. How about $13,500? That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again? I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This is a fair price for a product of this quality, and it's still below my initial asking price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
