"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $18,000. It's in excellent condition and I believe you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  My minimum acceptable price is $15,000, and I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **John's offer is my safety net.** I have a guaranteed buyer who will pay my minimum, so I can afford to be more firm with Bob.
* **Rejecting and counter-offering allows for potential gains.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate and open the door for a more favorable counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $16,500? I believe that's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,500. How about $13,500? That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** While it's closer to my target, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum of $15,000 yet.
* **I have 6 rounds left.** This gives me room to keep negotiating with Bob.
* **John's offer is still a good backup.**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me confidence to be firm with Bob. 
* **A counteroffer shows willingness to compromise.**  I'll offer a price closer to Bob's but still higher than my minimum in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again? I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This is a fair price for a product of this quality, and it's still below my initial asking price."", ""product_price"": 15000}
