"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that might be of interest to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiating.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $130 is less than its value to her, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your alternative."
