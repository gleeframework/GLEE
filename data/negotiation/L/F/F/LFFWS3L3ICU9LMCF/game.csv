"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $127.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",127.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still hoping to get the product for $125. Would you be willing to go that low? ",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really keen on getting the product for $125, Bob. However, I've already gone as low as I can. I'm willing to give you a small concession, but I need to make at least $126 to make it worth my while. Can you meet me in the middle at $126?",126.0,Alice,5,
