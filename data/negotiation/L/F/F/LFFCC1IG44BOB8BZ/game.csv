,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my current needs. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000?  It's a reasonable price for the product and still allows some room for profit for you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1250000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1100000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1150000. This offer is a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm very close to my budget limit. $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $1125000, but that's my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
