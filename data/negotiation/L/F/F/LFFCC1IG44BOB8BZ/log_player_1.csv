"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my current needs. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  It's a reasonable price for the product and still allows some room for profit for you. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1250000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1100000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can reach a deal before selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,150,000. This offer is a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm very close to my budget limit. $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $1125000, but that's my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While I'd like to get more, Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  John's offer is a guaranteed sale, and it's time to move on."
