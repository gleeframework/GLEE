"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'd like to start with an offer of $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still within Alice's desired range. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Is there any flexibility in your price?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $10,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price:** $11,000 is a good compromise and is significantly lower than the initial $12,000 offer.
* **Time is a factor:** Bob has limited rounds to negotiate, and continuing to reject might risk Alice getting a better offer from another buyer.
* **John's price:** While John offers the product for $15,000, buying from Alice for $11,000 saves Bob $4,000. 

Accepting Alice's offer secures a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John's higher price."
