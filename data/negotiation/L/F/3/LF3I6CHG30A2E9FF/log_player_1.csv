Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still getting more than your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob's likely to counter, and this gives you space to negotiate up from this point. 
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This gives Bob an incentive to accept, as he's still getting a good deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still lower than my initial offer. I'm going to counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm countering with $1,125,000. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still holding out for a better price than Bob's last offer.  It also keeps the negotiations moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still a significant amount lower than what I think the product is worth. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob's last offer halfway. It shows a willingness to close the deal while still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging, and his offers are getting too low. I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find a price that works for both of us.  Rather than risk continuing to negotiate and getting an even lower offer, I'm going to sell to John. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal, and it's better than risking getting stuck with a much lower offer."
