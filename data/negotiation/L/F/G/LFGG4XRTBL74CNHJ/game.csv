"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, however. How about $1,300,000? This still gives you a significant saving and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,250,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my limits.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than what I need, but I'm open to finalizing this deal. How about $1,350,000? This price allows us both to meet our needs and finalize the sale. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $1,280,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're reaching your limit, but $1,280,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $1,320,000? This price reflects a significant compromise from my initial position and gives you a good deal. Let's finalize this transaction.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,320,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach a deal. How about $1,260,000? I think this is the best we can do without going over my limit.",1260000.0,Bob,8,
