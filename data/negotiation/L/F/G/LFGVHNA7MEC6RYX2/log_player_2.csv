"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer right away. You have no information on how much she values the product, so there's potential to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down from her initial $12,000 price to $11,000, which is a decent compromise. You're still saving $1,000 compared to John's price, and it's likely that further negotiation will be more time-consuming. Accepting Alice's offer is a good way to get the product while minimizing your spending."
