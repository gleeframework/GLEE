Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm asking for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning that the product is ""worth a significant amount,""  Alice subtly anchors the value in Bob's mind, potentially making him more receptive to a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but rather suggestive, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects the initial price.
* There's a risk that Bob will walk away if the price is too high. Alice needs to weigh this risk against the potential for a higher profit."
