Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly less than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This initial offer allows for negotiation space while still ensuring I get a reasonable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with counteroffers and negotiation.
* **Backup Option:**  While I'm optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob, I have John as a backup, guaranteeing a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  While Bob is interested, his offer is not acceptable. I will counteroffer to keep the negotiation going and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Backup Option:**  I still have John as a backup, providing me with a guaranteed sale at my desired price if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm counteroffering with a price of $9,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I receive a fair price.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and reiterates the value proposition of the product to Bob, making the counteroffer more appealing.
* **Backup Plan:**  I still have John as a backup, which allows me to walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500, but I don't think I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob has moved slightly closer with his offer of $8,500, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose a significant amount of money.
* **John's Guarantee:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000, which is much more profitable than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob will take time and energy.  It's more efficient and profitable to accept John's offer and finalize the sale."
