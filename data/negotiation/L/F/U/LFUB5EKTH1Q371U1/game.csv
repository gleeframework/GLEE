"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make some concessions to get us started, and I'm open to negotiating further. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $750,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $800,000, which would be $825,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's true value to me is $1,000,000.
