"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $170. I know it's valuable to you, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth. It makes more sense to buy from John at the standard price."
