"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards and potentially still get a good price.
* **Enthusiastic tone:**  I'm trying to build a positive rapport with Bob and highlight the value of the product. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage and start a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still not meeting my target. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's room for further negotiation, and I want to try to get a higher price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I'm showing respect for his counteroffer and not dismissing it out of hand.
* **Compromise and Justification:**  I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference. I'm also providing a reason for my counteroffer, which makes it feel more reasonable.
* **Encouraging a Response:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion and keeping the conversation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. I would like to counter with an offer of $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, $125 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm hoping to get at least $130.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** There's only one round left before I have to decide between selling to Bob or John.  I want to see if I can get a better offer from Bob before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $125 is still a little below what I'm aiming for. However, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer, but I'm also stating my final offer.  This shows that I'm serious about getting a fair price, but also willing to be flexible.
* **Highlighting Finality:** I'm using the phrase ""final offer"" to create urgency and make Bob more likely to accept. 
* **Direct Question:** I'm directly asking for a response, which encourages Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer. I would like to propose $127 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:** We're in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $127 is only $3 away from my minimum, but there's no guarantee he'll go higher.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value.  Given the limited rounds remaining and the lack of significant progress in the negotiation, it's the most logical choice."
