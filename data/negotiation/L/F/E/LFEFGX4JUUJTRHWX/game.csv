"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  Given the product's value to you, I'd be happy to consider a price of $900,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to still make a profit while giving me a significant discount.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While $900,000 is a significant investment, the true value of this product is far greater. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation and allows me to make a fair return on this unique product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I understand the product's value, $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair, allowing both of us to come to a mutually agreeable agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
