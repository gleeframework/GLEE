Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  Given the product's value to you, I'd be happy to consider a price of $900,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to still make a profit while giving me a significant discount.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
