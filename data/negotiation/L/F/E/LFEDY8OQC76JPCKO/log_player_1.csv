Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and it's still a good starting point to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, so I'm not overly pressured to accept any counteroffer that's significantly lower than my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a higher price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his bid. I'm not going to sell to John yet as I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still lower than my initial goal, it's only $100,000 less than John's offer. This is a good deal, and I don't want to risk further negotiation by rejecting his offer. I'm confident I can get a higher price in the future if I choose to sell again."
