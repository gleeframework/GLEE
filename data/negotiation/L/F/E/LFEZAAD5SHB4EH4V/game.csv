,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $105. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle on $90? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $98. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",98.0,Alice,5,
