"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1300000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll love it!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1300000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and save some money for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $1250000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm counteroffering at $1280000. This is a fair price considering its true value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1280000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1280000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a better price. I'm counteroffering at $1260000. I'm trying to find a balance between the product's value to me and the price I'm willing to pay.",1260000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go below $1290000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to me is $1500000. I think this is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
