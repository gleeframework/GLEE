While I'd like to get closer to my target price, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. At this point, time is becoming a factor and I'm getting closer to the point where I'd rather accept John's offer. It's a guaranteed sale for my desired price, and the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob isn't worth the potential loss."
