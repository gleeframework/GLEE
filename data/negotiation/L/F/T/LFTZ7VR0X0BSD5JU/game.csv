"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my estimated value of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to offer you $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my own. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price is still reasonable considering the value of the product and the opportunity it offers you. I believe this is a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part and is a fair price considering both our values.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but $1,300,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. To show I'm willing to be flexible, I'm offering a final counteroffer of $1,325,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. If you're serious about this deal, let's close it at this price.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
