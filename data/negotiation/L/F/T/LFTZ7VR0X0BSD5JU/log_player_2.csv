Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. This price reflects its value and allows for a healthy margin.  Let me know your thoughts.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price is still reasonable considering the value of the product and the opportunity it offers you. I believe this is a fair compromise.  What do you say?

Round 5
