Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be very interested in. My asking price is $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have several rounds to negotiate. I'm going to try to push for a higher price, but if I don't see a significant improvement soon, I may consider selling to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go below $8,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to make sure I get a fair return. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
