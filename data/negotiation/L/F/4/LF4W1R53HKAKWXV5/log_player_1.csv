Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. Starting at $20,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying significantly above your minimum.
* **Creating a sense of exclusivity:**  By mentioning you're offering it to Bob before a public listing, you create a sense of urgency and potential scarcity. This might make the offer more appealing even if the price is higher than his perceived value. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the offer is $20,000, the message implies a willingness to discuss the price. This allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a price that's beneficial for both parties, but still above your $15,000 minimum."
