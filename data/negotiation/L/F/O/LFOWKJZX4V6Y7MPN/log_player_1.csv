Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counter-offers. I'm also hoping to capitalize on his potential desire for the product.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $1,500,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm serious about making a deal.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for him to accept, but still allows me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me, and it's a significant improvement over his initial offer. I'm not willing to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate, especially since I have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John."
