Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves a reasonable profit margin for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's closer. I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
