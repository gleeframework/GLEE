Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so we need to offer a price higher than that to make it appealing.
* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 creates a significant profit margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob.  It leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a ""deal"" if he values the potential upside of the product highly.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" introduces a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a guaranteed sale to John."
