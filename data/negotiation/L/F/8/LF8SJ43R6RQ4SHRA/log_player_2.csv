# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $180 is way too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm willing to make a compromise to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While $140 is better, it's still more than I want to spend. I'll try to negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we settle at $115?"",

``` 

I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm still trying to leave some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $140, Bob. How about we meet at $130? I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is getting close, but I'm still not willing to go above my $120 limit. One more try!"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $122.50?"",
""product_price"": 122.50
}
``` 

This keeps me below my $120 limit while still offering a compromise that might be appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $122.50. How about we try to find a price that's closer to my minimum of $140? I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It seems like Alice won't budge below $130. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer of $120."
