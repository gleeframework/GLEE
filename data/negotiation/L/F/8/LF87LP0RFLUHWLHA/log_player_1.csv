Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've shown interest in.  I'm asking $90 for it, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. I'm also indicating my willingness to negotiate, which might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $70 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is more than my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired $80. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price, given the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $85 is a fair price for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider $78 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $78 is getting closer to my minimum price of $80, and it's a better price than I would get from John.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation."
