"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 simply doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,375. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",10375.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,375 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise and settle on $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'll try to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer $10,250. I really think this is the best price I can afford.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $10,250 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,375.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit while still staying within your budget.  What do you say?",10375.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, to be honest. I've been willing to meet you in the middle multiple times, but I still can't quite get to a price that works for both of us. I'll try one more time, so I'll offer $10,000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John.",10000.0,Bob,8,
