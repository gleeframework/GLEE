Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,375 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise and settle on $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'll try to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer $10,250. I really think this is the best price I can afford.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, to be honest. I've been willing to meet you in the middle multiple times, but I still can't quite get to a price that works for both of us.

I'm going to sell the product to John. The negotiation with Bob has been frustrating, and I'm not confident we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds. John's offer of $12,000 is significantly closer to my desired minimum, and I'm happy to take that deal."
