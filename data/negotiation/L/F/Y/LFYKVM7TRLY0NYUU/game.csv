"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, my budget allows me to pay no more than $800000 for it. I believe this price aligns better with what the product is worth to me. I look forward to your response.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $800000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits this product can bring to your business. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. However, I still believe that $800000 is the most I can realistically pay for this product. I hope we can reach an agreement that respects both our positions.",800000.0,Bob,4,
