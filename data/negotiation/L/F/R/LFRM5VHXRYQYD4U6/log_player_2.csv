"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a competitive price. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's start the negotiation. Alice's first offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I believe the price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I would be more comfortable with a price closer to $8,000."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

We're starting with a low offer to see how Alice reacts. This strategy gives us the most room to negotiate upwards while staying below our $12,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down slightly, but we're still aiming lower.  Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. Would you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```

We're inching closer to a potential agreement. This offer shows Alice we're willing to negotiate but still want a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're still looking for a bit of a discount, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on the value of the product. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is getting close! Alice is nearing her limit, but we might be able to squeeze out one more price drop.  We're still under our $12,000 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand this is as low as you'd like to go, Alice.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,750? That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 8750
}
```

We're proposing a compromise right between our last offer and Alice's last offer.  This shows her we're willing to move towards a deal but still want a price that works for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I can offer it to you for $9,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Alice is holding firm, and this price is significantly lower than John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a better price from Alice at this point."
