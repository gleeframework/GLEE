"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair price, considering the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not willing to pay $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $825000. Can you consider this price?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still think the product is worth more than $825000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price, considering the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your frustration, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value.

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $790000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower.
