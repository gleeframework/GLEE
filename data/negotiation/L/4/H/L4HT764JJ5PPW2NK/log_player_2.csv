"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know is worth a lot to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair to both of us. I'm asking $9,000 for it.  If you're interested, let me know and we can arrange a time to discuss it further.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $10,000.
* Alice is offering it for $9,000.
* You can get it from John for $10,000. 

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still save $1,000 by rejecting her offer and buying from John."
