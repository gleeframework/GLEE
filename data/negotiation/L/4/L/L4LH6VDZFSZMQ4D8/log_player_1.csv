Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $900,000.  This is a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is still below my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Positive message:** I'm framing it as a win-win opportunity for Bob.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate and how far he's willing to go. 
* **Plan B:** I'm keeping the option open to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.
* **Opportunity for a better counteroffer:** I can likely get a higher price from Bob. 
* **John as a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $850,000. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment. Let's find a way to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation amicable and emphasizing the value of the product to Bob.
* **Staying above my minimum:** This offer keeps me above my minimum value of $1,000,000 while still showing flexibility. 
* **Setting the stage for a potential final agreement:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $875000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000 again. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:**  He's not willing to budge further, and his offer is still $150,000 below my minimum value.
* **Time is money:**  Negotiating further with Bob risks wasting valuable time.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  John offers me a guaranteed sale at my minimum value, eliminating the risk of further negotiation.

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure the best possible price and avoid potentially losing more money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
