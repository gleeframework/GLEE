"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm also open to negotiating further if you're willing to make a more serious offer. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle on $9,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's meet at $13,000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,5,
