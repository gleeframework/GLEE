"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair price and I can close the deal right now.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'll meet you at $10,500. It's a small increase, but it's worth it for the value this product brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting a little frustrating.  $10,250 is my final offer.  If you don't accept, I'm going to have to go with John.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $10,250. I'll sell the product to you for $10,375. It's a compromise, but I think it's fair for both of us.",10375.0,Alice,7,
