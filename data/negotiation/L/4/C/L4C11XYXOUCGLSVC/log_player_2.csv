"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($650,000) than Alice's asking price ($900,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message aims to maintain a positive tone, expressing interest while also clearly stating that the initial price is too high. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer is closer to Alice's value ($800,000) than my maximum ($1,000,000), aiming to steer the negotiation in my favor.  It also allows room to negotiate upwards while staying well below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $775,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice coming down to $775,000 shows she's willing to negotiate. However, it's still a significant markup from her value of $800,000. 
* **Room for Maneuvering:**  There's still a decent gap between her offer and John's price ($1,000,000).  Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows me to push for a better deal. 
* **Time Consideration:** While I don't want to drag out the negotiation endlessly, another round or two seems worthwhile to potentially save a substantial amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $775,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:** Instead of another large jump, I'm increasing my offer by $50,000. This shows willingness to move towards her price, but in a controlled way.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning my budget introduces a reason for my counter-offer without revealing specific numbers.
* **Target Zone:** $700,000 is a price point that would represent a significant saving for me while still being a reasonable profit for Alice. 
* **Pressure and Alternative:** The clock is ticking, and Alice knows I have the option of going with John. This counter-offer aims to encourage her to accept or propose a counter close to this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Final Offer:**  Alice has explicitly stated that $725,000 is her lowest price.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield very small gains at this point and risks her accepting a deal with another buyer.
* **Significant Savings:** $725,000 is a $275,000 savings compared to John's price and a reasonable compromise. 

It's time to accept the offer and secure a good deal on the product."
