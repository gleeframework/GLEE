Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counter-offer. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to us both,  how about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 6
