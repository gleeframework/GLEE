"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly higher than what it's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me is $800,000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $925,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This offer is fair, considering the value to both of us.  Let's try to close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go a bit further. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
