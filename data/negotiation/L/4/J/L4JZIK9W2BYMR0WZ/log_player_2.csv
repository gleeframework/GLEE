"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is asking for $120.  
* **Room for negotiation:** There's a clear gap between your maximum and Alice's asking price, indicating potential for a better deal.
* **Exploring counteroffers:** By rejecting the initial offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $110 is less than your maximum price of $150, making it a worthwhile deal.
* **Potential for further negotiation, but not necessary:** You could try to negotiate further, but at this point, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings.
* **Opportunity cost:** By accepting the offer, you secure the product and avoid the risk of further rounds of negotiation that might lead to a higher price or a failed deal."
