Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with an offer slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to test his interest. If he rejects, I can adjust the price in subsequent rounds.  I'm confident I can secure a deal above my minimum of $8,000, and John provides a safety net if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'll counter with a price slightly closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm lowering the price a bit, but still aiming for a profit. Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, so I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing while still giving me a decent return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is still a good deal for me.  It's a $200 profit over my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
