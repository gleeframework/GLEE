Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower."", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
