"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
