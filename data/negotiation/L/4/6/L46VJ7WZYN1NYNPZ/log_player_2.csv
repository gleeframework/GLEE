"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget and is a better price than what John is offering. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer, and the price could increase again.  It's more advantageous to accept this offer and secure the product within his budget."
