Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and might even lead to a better outcome than expected.
* **Anchor the Price:** By starting at $150, you establish a high reference point in Bob's mind. Even if he counters lower, the starting point influences his perception of the product's value.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer will give you an idea of how eager Bob is to purchase. If he accepts immediately, you know you might have priced it too low. If he rejects it, you can adjust your approach based on his counteroffer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Be Confident:**  Believe in the value of your product and convey that confidence in your communication with Bob.
* **Be Flexible:** Be prepared to make adjustments to your asking price, but don't undervalue your product by dropping too low too quickly. Remember, John is waiting as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay that much for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to your minimum, there's still room for negotiation. You started high, and it's reasonable to assume he might be willing to go a bit higher.  You'll counter-offer to see if you can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that often feels fair to both parties. It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Maintaining Value:** You're not dropping your price drastically, which reinforces the idea that your product is worth more than Bob's initial offer.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** There's a chance Bob might counter again, and this offer leaves space for further discussion while staying above your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to pay that much for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $125, which is a reasonable compromise. While you could potentially push for a bit more in another round, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $25 over your minimum and avoids the potential of losing the sale altogether."
