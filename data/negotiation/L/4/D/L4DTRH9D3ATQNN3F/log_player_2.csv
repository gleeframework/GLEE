{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's value of $1,200,000 but wants to leave some room for negotiation. A counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a reasonable starting point, offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price while still being within Bob's budget."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has increased her offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's still potential to negotiate a lower price, making rejecting the offer and sending another counteroffer the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's willing to pay more than his initial counteroffer, but still wants to stay below Alice's latest offer. This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still seeking a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000. At this point, the potential savings by continuing to negotiate are minimal. It's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,500,000, avoiding further negotiation and ensuring a purchase within his budget."
