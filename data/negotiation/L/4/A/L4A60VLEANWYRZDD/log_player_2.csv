"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this fantastic item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum valuation. It's important to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,500. This is a fair price that still gives me a good profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $14,500 is still significantly higher than your target price and what John offers. You should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $11,000? I think that's a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,200. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is presenting this as her ""final offer"", you're still in a strong negotiating position. You have John's offer of $12,000 to fall back on.  Let's see if we can push Alice a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. I'm trying to make this work, but $13,200 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $11,800? That's a pretty significant move on my end."",
""product_price"": 11800
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,800. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,800. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth the risk of pushing her away.  John's offer of $12,000 is a sure thing and saves you money compared to Alice's latest offer."
