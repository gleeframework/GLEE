"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite high. This product fits into my budget closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider an offer in that range?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,800,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere closer to $1,300,000? I'm eager to make a deal if we can find the right price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,300,000 is still below my ideal price point, I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
