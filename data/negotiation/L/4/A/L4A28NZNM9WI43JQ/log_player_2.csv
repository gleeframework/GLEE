"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. It's highly unlikely you'd accept this price.  A counter-offer is necessary to bring the negotiation closer to a realistic price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite high. This product fits into my budget closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider an offer in that range?"",
 ""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:**  Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price creates room for negotiation.  
* **Anchoring:** Offering $1,000,000 establishes a lower anchor point, potentially influencing Alice's perception of a reasonable price. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message keeps the tone polite and emphasizes that you're willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than your ideal price and John's offer. There's room to negotiate further. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,800,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere closer to $1,300,000? I'm eager to make a deal if we can find the right price."",
 ""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer moves the negotiation closer to a mutually acceptable price, while still staying below your budget limit and John's offer.
* **Demonstrating Seriousness:** By suggesting a specific price, you show Alice you're serious about finding a compromise.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:** The message remains polite and emphasizes your desire to complete the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,300,000 is still below my ideal price point, I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,600,000 is only slightly above John's price and within your budget. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge or might even withdraw the offer altogether. Accepting this offer guarantees you get the product at a price that's reasonably close to your target."
