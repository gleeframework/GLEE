Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still go higher if Bob counters, but it gives him an incentive to accept.
* **It's a fair starting point:** The offer is below the product's value to Bob, giving him a reason to negotiate. 

Let me know how Bob responds, and we can continue the negotiation!"
