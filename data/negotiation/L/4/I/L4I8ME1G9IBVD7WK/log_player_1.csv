Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The offer of $19,000 is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This allows you to see how interested Bob is and how much he's willing to pay.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a safety net with John who will buy the product for $15,000. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price downwards, but you can't go back up once an offer is made."
