"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. I value it highly, but I'm open to discussing a price that benefits both of us. How about we start at $1,150,000? I believe this reflects its true worth.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is significantly below its value.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and generate significant returns for you. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. This is my final offer.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,120,000 is still a bit steep. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,085,000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1085000.0,Bob,4,
