"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $150, so you're willing to pay up to that amount.
* Alice's offer is $125, which is a good deal but still leaves you with some room to negotiate.
* You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating with John, or finding another seller."
