"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. How about $760,000? That would be a comfortable price point for me.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I can offer you the product for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
