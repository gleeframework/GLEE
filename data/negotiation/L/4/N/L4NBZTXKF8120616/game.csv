"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'm not quite ready to commit to $900,000.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
