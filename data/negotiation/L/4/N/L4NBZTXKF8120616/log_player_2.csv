"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000) and my maximum budget ($1,200,000). There's room for negotiation. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'm not quite ready to commit to $900,000.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer to $950,000, which is closer to my target price. While I'd prefer to get it for even less, accepting this offer saves me $250,000 compared to buying from John.  Considering I have limited rounds, accepting now seems like the most sensible option."
