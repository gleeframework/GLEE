"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm proposing a new price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a compromise between our initial offers and still reflects the value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
