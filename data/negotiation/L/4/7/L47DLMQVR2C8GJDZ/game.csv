"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $15000?  That's my maximum for this purchase.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $15000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $16500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a higher price, but $16500 is still above what I can afford. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go up to $16000.  This would allow us both to make a fair deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,
