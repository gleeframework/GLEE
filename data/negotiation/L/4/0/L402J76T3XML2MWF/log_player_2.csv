"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is pretty close to my maximum price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives us space to find a middle ground.
* **Polite and Positive:**  I maintain a friendly tone to encourage a positive negotiation. 
* **Justification:** I don't need to give a specific reason for my counter-offer, but by saying it's ""a bit steep,"" I imply I might be willing to move up a little."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating!  While $110 is better, I'm aiming to get as close to $100 as possible. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 107.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer proposes a price directly in between our last two offers, signaling a willingness to compromise. 
* **Seeking Agreement:**  By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm emphasizing the collaborative nature of the negotiation. 
* **Precision:** The use of a specific number like $107.50  makes the offer feel more concrete and considered."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $108.75? This would give you a good deal, and it would be a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller. $108.75 is a decent deal, and continuing to haggle might irritate Alice. 
* **Time Value:**  Each round takes time, and I'm already five rounds in. Accepting now secures the product at a good price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's always a risk Alice could walk away, and I'd end up having to buy from John for $120. Accepting now eliminates that risk."
