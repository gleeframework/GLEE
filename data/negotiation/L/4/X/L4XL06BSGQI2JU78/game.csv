"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $9000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $7500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy now.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $8500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $8500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $8250. This is a fair price and a good compromise.  What do you say?",8250.0,Bob,4,
