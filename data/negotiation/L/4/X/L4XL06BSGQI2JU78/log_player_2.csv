"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $9,000 is above his budget, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $7,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy now."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $8500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $8,500 is closer to his budget, he can still potentially negotiate a better price. He can try to get closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $8,250. This is a fair price and a good compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
