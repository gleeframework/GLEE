"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $150.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is a bit too low for me. How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the product."", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $135, which is still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still trying to secure a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you consider $132? It's getting close to the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $132 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $132 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $134. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 134} 
``` 

I'm offering $134, which is still above my minimum but shows a willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $134. Can you meet me at $131? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $131 is close to my minimum, I'm not going to accept it just yet.  I still have a few rounds left and I want to see if I can get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $133? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.  Let's do it."", ""product_price"": 133} 
``` 

I'm offering $133, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal with only a few rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close, but I still think I can get a better deal. Can you consider $130? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob still refusing to budge on his offer of $130, I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 from John. It's better than risking getting a lower price or ending up with no deal at all."
