"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find very appealing. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're open to discussing this."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a significant discount from the original offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above my budget, but closer. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll try a counter-offer closer to my budget in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is a bit above your latest offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is tempting, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to take a chance and see if I can negotiate further. If Alice rejects my next counteroffer, I might consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. However, $13,500 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above my budget.  I've tried several counteroffers, but it seems like we're hitting a wall. Rather than continue the negotiation and risk running out of rounds, I'm going to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer and leaving me without a deal."
