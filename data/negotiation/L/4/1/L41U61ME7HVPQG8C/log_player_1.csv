Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you get a price significantly higher than your minimum ($80).
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $100 (Bob's maximum) might seem too aggressive and could lead to an immediate rejection. 

This strategy aims to balance profit maximization with a higher chance of Bob accepting the offer."
