"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $12,000.  I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to my maximum budget but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'll reject and try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still outside my range.  How about $15,500?  That's a fair compromise and closer to what I can afford."", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm moving closer to Alice's last offer but still leaving some space for negotiation. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to go over my maximum budget."
