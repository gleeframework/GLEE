Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it holds for you."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My primary goal is to get as much money as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, I want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $950,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still exceeding my minimum price. 
* **Highlight Value:**  My message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product to Bob. While he values it at $800,000, reminding him of its benefits might justify a higher price in his mind. 

By offering the product at $950,000, I'm aiming to strike a balance between maximizing my potential earnings and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer before I move on to John."
