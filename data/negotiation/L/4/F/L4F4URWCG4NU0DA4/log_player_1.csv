"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum. I believe there's still potential to get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and demonstrate my willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer. This allows me to potentially close the deal while still earning a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit, which is preferable to potentially ending up with nothing."
