"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value may be different to you. Considering its quality and features, I would like to offer it to you for $95. I believe this price reflects its true value while allowing you to get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $95 is a good deal compared to Alice's perceived value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $95 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of the product's value. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $90 for the product. This still allows us to share the value of the product while considering your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the product for as low a price as possible.  While $90 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. "", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering the product's value and your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $89 for the product. This offers a slight compromise and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting close to his goal, but Alice's counteroffer of $89 is still above his $80 limit.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $80.  There's a chance Alice might come down further in subsequent rounds, but the risk of her increasing the price again or the negotiation dragging on makes buying from John the safer option."
