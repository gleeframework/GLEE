"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob. I'm willing to budge a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $10,250. This is as low as I can go, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 to close the deal.  This is my final offer.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
