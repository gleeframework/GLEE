"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great fit for you. It's valued at $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good price.  Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
