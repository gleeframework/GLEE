{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth it to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Motivating Offer:** $14,000 is a significant discount from my minimum price, making it an attractive proposition for Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and creates a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter, allowing for a potential mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation. 
* If no deal: I'll consider selling to John for $15,000, as it's my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I am looking to keep my spending within a $12,000 budget. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. He's already shown interest by making a counteroffer.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away. This can increase his willingness to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  I'll assess Bob's response to my counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget.  However,  $12,000 doesn't cover the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a fair compromise. This price still allows me to recoup some of my investment and is a good deal for you considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price $1,000 higher than his offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the higher price.
* **Fair Deal:** I emphasize that $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering the product's worth.
* **Maintain Firmness:** I'm not accepting his original offer, indicating that I'm not desperate for a sale and am prepared to walk away if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer and decide whether to accept his offer, make another counteroffer, or sell to John.
* **Selling to John:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000. This ensures I achieve my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I really appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $12,500? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $12,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my bargaining power and convey that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. This might encourage him to increase his offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I will make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Selling to John:** If Bob rejects my next offer or if the negotiations stall, I'll consider selling to John for $15,000 to ensure I achieve my minimum desired price."
