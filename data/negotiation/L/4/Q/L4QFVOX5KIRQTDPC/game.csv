"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $10,750. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $10,900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10900.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,900 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,800.  This feels like a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away happy.",10800.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,800.
