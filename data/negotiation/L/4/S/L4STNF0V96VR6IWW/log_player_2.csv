"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth more to you than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if he doesn't get a good deal. 

This counteroffer also leaves room for negotiation. Alice might be willing to come down a bit, and Bob might be willing to go up a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $14000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a little more. How about $16000? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price point. Bob has a limited budget and wants to save as much as possible.  

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price closer to his goal.  There is a chance that Alice might be willing to come down further, especially since Bob has already indicated his willingness to pay $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000. However, that's still a little out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing that he is serious about wanting the product, but is still committed to staying within his budget. This counteroffer is a compromise: it's higher than Bob's initial offer but still lower than Alice's current offer. This sets the stage for a potential final agreement."
