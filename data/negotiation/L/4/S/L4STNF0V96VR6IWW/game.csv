"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $14000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a little more. How about $16000? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that.",16000.0,Alice,3,
