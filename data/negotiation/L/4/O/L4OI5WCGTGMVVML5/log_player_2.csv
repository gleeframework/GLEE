"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I understand its value to you is quite high, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. Let's discuss a price of $9,500. This allows me to get a good return on my investment, while still giving you a significant value proposition.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
