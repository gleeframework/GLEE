"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,000. It's still a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,200.
