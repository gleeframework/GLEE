Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,500,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $1,650,000?  This gives you a great opportunity to acquire this valuable product at a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1650000 is still a bit high for me. How about $1600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than what I hoped for, it's closer to my minimum price and it's likely we'll just keep going back and forth if I reject his offer.  It's better to close the deal now and secure the sale."
