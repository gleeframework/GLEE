"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than the product's value to her ($800,000). There's room for negotiation to get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and leaves some room for you to still make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still higher than my ideal price.  While it's a reduction from her initial offer, there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if we can get closer to my target price of $950,000.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects its value to me and allows you to make a substantial profit. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a significant profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my target price, but it's still a bit too high. I believe there's still room for a compromise. While she claims this is her final offer, there's a chance she might be willing to negotiate further if I make another counteroffer. I want to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000 before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your final offer, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,050,000. Given the value of the product to both of us, I believe a price of $1,025,000 is a fair compromise. It allows me to stay within my budget and ensures you still make a substantial profit. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in the negotiation process. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering $1050000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I need to make a decision soon, as I have other interested buyers. I'm giving you one last chance to meet my price, or I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer of $1,050,000 is still too high for me. Even though it's a decent compromise,  it's getting close to the price John is offering, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure the product from John at a higher price than risk losing the deal and potentially having to pay even more."
