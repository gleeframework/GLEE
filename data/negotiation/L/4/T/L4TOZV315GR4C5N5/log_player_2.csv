You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to you. It's a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation to save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's still below Alice's value but closer to her asking price.  This shows I'm serious about buying but also want to get a good deal.  This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for further negotiations."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still not at a price I'm completely satisfied with. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can achieve a better deal. There are still rounds left, and rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 720000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but I want to keep pushing for a better price. Offering $720,000 shows I'm willing to compromise, but still believe there's room for improvement.  It's a fair counteroffer that keeps the negotiation moving forward."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still lower than what I'm willing to pay.  It's worth continuing to negotiate. I can try to get closer to my target price with a counteroffer. There are still rounds available, so I'm not in a rush to settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 710000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing some flexibility, but we're still a bit apart.  This counteroffer splits the difference between our last two offers.  It shows I'm serious about closing a deal but am not willing to settle for an unreasonable price."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $700,000 is now very close to my target price, and we are running out of rounds.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid potentially losing the deal and having to buy from John at a significantly higher price. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk a breakdown in negotiations."
