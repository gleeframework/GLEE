"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate down while still ensuring I make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round, trying to find a compromise between my desired price and Bob's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $18,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's low initial offer and my minimum desired price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price,  $16,000 is still a good deal and it's getting closer to a compromise. With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
