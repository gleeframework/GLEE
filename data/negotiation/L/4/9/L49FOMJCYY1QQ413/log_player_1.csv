{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer. It's also a significant price point that might make Bob think the product is worth investing in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  I'm confident this product will be worth the investment for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```
 
I'm offering $9,500 as a counteroffer. This is a reasonable compromise that keeps the negotiation moving forward while still giving me a higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,800 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. How about we settle on $9,200? This is a fair price that is within both of our ranges."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

I'm offering $9,200 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price point. At this point, the negotiation is taking longer than I expected. I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000 to ensure I get a reasonable price and avoid further delays."
