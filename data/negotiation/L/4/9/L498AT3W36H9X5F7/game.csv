"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This would give us both a reasonable profit, and we can finalize the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $925,000 is closer, but I still need to make a decent profit. How about we split the difference and settle on $937,500? This would be a fair outcome for both of us.",937500.0,Alice,5,
