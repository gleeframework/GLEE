Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A starting price of $150 offers a 25% profit margin if Bob accepts. This isn't so high that it's likely to scare him off immediately. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests you're open to discussing the price further if Bob has concerns. 

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while still keeping the sale secure with John as a backup."
