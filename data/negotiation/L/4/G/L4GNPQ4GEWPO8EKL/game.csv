"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $725,000? I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is the best I can do without losing too much profit, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
