{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13250}

I'm still not comfortable with $12,750. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to drop too much lower. I want to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price in the next few rounds."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm getting close to my minimum price, but it's still too low for me.  I don't want to risk going lower and getting stuck with a price that is significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's more appealing, so I'll sell to him."
