"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and the fact that it's worth $15000 to you, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. To start, I propose a price of $12000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $8,000.  This means there's room for negotiation to find a price that benefits both parties.
* **Potential Savings:** By rejecting the initial offer, Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price.

It's always a good strategy to start with rejection when there's a significant gap between your maximum and the seller's initial price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I propose a price of $11500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer.  Even though Alice has lowered the price, there's still room for negotiation. 

* **Bob's goal:** Bob wants to save as much money as possible. He still has a significant buffer between the current offer ($11,500) and his maximum budget ($15,000).
* **Negotiation room:** Alice is now willing to sell for $11,500, which is still above her minimum value of $8,000. This indicates she has some room to compromise further. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially get the product for an even lower price in future rounds."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I've considered your proposal and would like to offer a price of $11000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is a good price, Bob should still reject it. He has made progress, but he can likely get the product for even less.  

* **Savings Potential:** Bob is still willing to pay up to $15,000. There's still a significant gap between Alice's offer and his maximum budget, making further negotiation worthwhile.
* **Alice's Flexibility:**  Alice has shown she's willing to compromise. This means she likely has more room to lower her price.

By rejecting the offer, Bob maintains the leverage he's built and increases the likelihood of a more favorable deal in the next round."
