"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, I'm not able to go that high. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? It's still a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my minimum target. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,750 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $11,125. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",11125.0,Alice,5,
