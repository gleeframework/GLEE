Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're down to the wire. I'm going to need to see $1,262,500 to make this work. It's a small increase from your last offer, but it's my final offer. If you're serious about this deal, let's close it now.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very stubbornly sticking close to her price. While she might come down a little in the final round, it's very unlikely she'll drop below $1,250,000. At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best way to maximize my savings."
