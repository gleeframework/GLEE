"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth $1,200,000 to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desire to make a deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product for $825,000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
