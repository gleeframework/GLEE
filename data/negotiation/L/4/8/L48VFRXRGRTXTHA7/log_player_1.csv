Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $18,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $12,000 for it. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is my initial asking price.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I still believe that $12,000 is a fair price for the product based on its value to me. Would it be possible for us to negotiate further towards that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to budge from his $12,000 offer.  Since I have a guaranteed offer for the same amount from John, it makes more sense to sell to John and avoid further (likely fruitless) negotiation.
