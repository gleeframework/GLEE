# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

The product is far too expensive for Bob's budget. He should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. If you're still interested, please let me know.

Bob should reject the offer.  While $1,500,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the same product from John for $1,000,000.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get the price lower, but if she won't go lower than $1,500,000 he should buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're still interested, please let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, he's already had multiple rounds of negotiation and it's clear she's not going to go as low as he wants. John is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is the maximum Bob is willing to spend.  It's better to get the product now at that price than to risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially end up paying more."
