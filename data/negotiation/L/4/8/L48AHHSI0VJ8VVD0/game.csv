"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm keen on the product, but the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm surprised you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'm going to take a risk and try to get a better deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you don't accept it.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
