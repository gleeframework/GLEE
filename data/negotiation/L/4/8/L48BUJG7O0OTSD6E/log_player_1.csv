"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value! Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant portion of the product's worth to me. It also sets a positive tone and emphasizes the value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about we aim for $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can negotiate a more favorable price. I still have 8 rounds to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can realistically accept. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer to my budget. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, how about we settle on $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. It's time to close this deal!"
