Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is just slightly above John's offer. At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are small, and the risk of a stalemate is high. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum budget, minimizing any further risk and saving valuable time."
