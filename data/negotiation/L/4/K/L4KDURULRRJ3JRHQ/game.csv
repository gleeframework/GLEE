"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,600,000?  This reflects its true worth while still offering you a competitive price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but I'm also confident you recognize the exceptional value of this product.  Walking away would mean missing out for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $1,400,000? This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
