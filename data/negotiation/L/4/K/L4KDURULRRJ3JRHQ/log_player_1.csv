**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has been firm on his $1,200,000 offer and has even threatened to walk away. While it's less than our initial target, we're still making a $200,000 profit. 

Continuing to negotiate risks:

* **Bob walking away:** We lose out on the $200,000 profit.
* **Further price drops:** We might have to go even lower than $1,200,000 to secure the deal. 

It's better to accept the current offer and secure a decent profit than risk losing the sale altogether."
