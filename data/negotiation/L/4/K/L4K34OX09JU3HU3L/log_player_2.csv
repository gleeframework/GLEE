Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?

Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. But $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5.
