{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $100, but leaves room for negotiation.  Bob might accept, or he might counteroffer. If he does, you can adjust your price based on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $105, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum price, and I'm happy to accept it. This is a good deal for me, as I've successfully negotiated a price above my minimum."
