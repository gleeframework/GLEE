Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to Bob to emphasize the potential benefit he'll get. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  The initial offer leaves room for Bob to counter without me feeling pressured to accept a price too low for me.

**Next steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (if any) or his decision to accept or reject my initial offer.  I'll be prepared to counter-offer if necessary, but I'll also be ready to walk away if Bob won't meet my minimum price and go with John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than John's offer of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my desired price range. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob.  I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $12,000, but be willing to negotiate a bit further.  I want to get the best possible price without risking losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I need. How about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, given the value of the product, and it would allow me to get a fair price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my desired price but still lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to emphasize the potential benefit.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, aiming for a win-win scenario. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and be prepared to further negotiate if necessary.  If he rejects this offer, I might consider lowering the price slightly, but I won't go below my minimum of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $9,750. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,750 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to secure a price closer to $10,000 to make this deal worthwhile. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $10,000.  I'll remind him of the product's value and my willingness to negotiate, but I'll also emphasize that I'm not willing to go too much lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a little hesitant about $9,750.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $10,000.  How about $10,250? It's a compromise on both our parts, and it will allow us to reach a mutually agreeable price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Negotiation:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down from my previous offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Focusing on Mutual Agreement:**  I emphasize that $10,250 is a compromise that benefits both of us, highlighting the win-win potential of the deal.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I continue to remind Bob of the product's value to him, making it clear that this price is still a good deal for him.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to lower my price further or stick to my minimum and sell to John.  However, I'm confident that this offer is appealing enough to encourage Bob to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $9,875. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,875 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I've reached a point where the potential gain from further negotiation is not worth the risk of losing the sale altogether.  

John's offer of $8,000 guarantees a sale and allows me to meet my minimum financial goal.  Although it's not ideal, it's a safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with no sale at all."
