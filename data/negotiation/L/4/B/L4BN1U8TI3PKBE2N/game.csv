"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than $1800000. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $1500000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1200000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1600000, but I still think that's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1300000. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1500000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  I believe the product's value justifies this price.  Let me know if you're willing to reconsider.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
