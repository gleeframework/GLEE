"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $135 is a better price than Alice's initial value, Bob can still do better.  He should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product as close to his maximum price ($120) as possible.  Offering $125 is a reasonable starting point for the counteroffer, giving Alice some room to negotiate while still staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $140 is higher than Bob's maximum price of $120.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John, who is offering the product at his desired price. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a better price for Bob."
