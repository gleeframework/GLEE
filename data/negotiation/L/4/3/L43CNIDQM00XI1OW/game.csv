"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, recognizing the value you see in the product. This would still be a significant profit for you, and it's the lowest I can go at this time. Please consider this offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $700,000 is still far too low for me.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would still be a significant profit for you, and it's the lowest I can go without compromising my own interests. Please let me know if you're willing to consider this final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to offer $750,000 as my final offer.  I believe this represents a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,6,
