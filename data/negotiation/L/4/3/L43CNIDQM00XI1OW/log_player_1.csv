"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's estimated value, but still within a range where it might be considered.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm including a message that attempts to justify the price, highlighting its value to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's room for negotiation in this initial offer, allowing for potential counteroffers and a back-and-forth. 
* **Protecting My Interest:** This offer is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, giving me a buffer if negotiations don't go as planned.

**Note:** This is just the first offer. I will adapt my strategy based on Bob's response in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far too low, well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate, I have a solid backup option with John.  There's no point in risking a much lower sale when I can secure a much better deal elsewhere."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, recognizing the value you see in the product. This would still be a significant profit for you, and it's the lowest I can go at this time. Please consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm making a counteroffer that's significantly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing the potential profit he could still make.
* **Setting a Limit:** I'm stating this is the lowest I can go, setting a clear boundary for further negotiation.

**Note:** This counteroffer still allows for further negotiation if necessary, but it also puts pressure on Bob to either accept or make a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While he's shown some willingness to negotiate, the gap is still too large.  There's no point in wasting more time with him when I have a guaranteed sale with John at a much more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $700,000 is still far too low for me.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would still be a significant profit for you, and it's the lowest I can go without compromising my own interests. Please let me know if you're willing to consider this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is presented as a ""final"" offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I reiterate the value of the product to Bob to justify my price.
* **Compromise & Limit:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise but also emphasizing that this is my absolute lowest offer.
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, I'm creating a sense of urgency.

**Note:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's a significant reduction.  I'm aiming to push Bob to either accept or make a more substantial counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to offer $750,000 as my final offer.  I believe this represents a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  With only a few rounds remaining, and the risk of getting a lower price, I'm choosing to take the guaranteed sale with John.  He's offering a price that meets my minimum requirement, and I don't want to risk further negotiations with Bob, which could potentially lead to a lower price or a stalemate.  I'm prioritizing a guaranteed and favorable outcome over potentially more time-consuming and uncertain negotiations."
