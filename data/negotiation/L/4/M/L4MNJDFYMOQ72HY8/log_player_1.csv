Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm suggesting a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than her minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Strong but Fair Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as mutually beneficial."
