"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  I'm willing to negotiate, however. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While $1,275,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel it's a bit high. Could we possibly aim for $1,250,000? This would better align with my budget constraints while still acknowledging the value of your product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
