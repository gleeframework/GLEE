"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm confident it's worth more than what others are willing to pay. However, I understand the importance of finding the right price for both parties. Therefore, I propose a special introductory offer of $120 for you. This price reflects the product's true worth while also ensuring a fair return for me. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.
