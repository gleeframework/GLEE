Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it's worth $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $140, which is slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room for negotiation while still making a decent profit. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion to hopefully avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob with some further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great price for a product that's worth so much. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm offering $125, which is still above my minimum acceptable price but also a bit closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows flexibility while also ensuring I still make a profit. I'm keeping the tone friendly and emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $120?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle for the $120 from John. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure the sale and get my desired minimum price."
