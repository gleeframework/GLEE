Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 10000} 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, knowing that John is willing to pay that. If Bob rejects, I'll need to reassess the situation and see if I want to continue negotiating or just sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because while it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price before settling with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering a price of $9,500. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm worried that I might not get a better offer in the next round. Additionally, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Selling to John is always an option, but I prefer to make a deal with Bob if possible."
