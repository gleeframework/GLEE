Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin to play with.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's appealing to Bob (meaning it's less than his perceived value) but still nets you a significant profit.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair price.""
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 leaves you with a $150,000 profit, significantly more than your fallback option.  This price also gives Bob a $50,000 benefit compared to his perceived value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  A higher offer is less risky (more likely to be accepted), while a lower offer maximizes potential profit but increases the risk of rejection."
