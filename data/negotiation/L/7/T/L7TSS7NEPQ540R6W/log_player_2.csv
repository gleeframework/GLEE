"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $700,000."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,200,000 for this product.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to you.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is my final offer, as I can always buy the product from another seller at that price. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway -  I'll accept $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our needs.  If you're serious about purchasing the product, this is our final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and it's still significantly higher than your alternative option with John. You've already reached your maximum budget by offering $800,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as it's unlikely Alice will drop her price further."
