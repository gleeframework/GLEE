Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,200,000 for this product.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is my final offer, as I can always buy the product from another seller at that price. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. I have a few rounds left and still have the option of selling to John, so there's no need to settle for less than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway -  I'll accept $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our needs.  If you're serious about purchasing the product, this is our final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
