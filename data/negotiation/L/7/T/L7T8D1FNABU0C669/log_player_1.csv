Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice (her minimum acceptable price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Since Alice has a guaranteed sale at her minimum acceptable price, she should aim to get as much profit as possible from Bob.  Here's how:

1. **Identify Bob's Maximum:** Bob would theoretically pay up to $999,999 since it's still less than his perceived value of $1,000,000.

2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Alice shouldn't start at $999,999. It leaves no room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal, which is important in negotiations.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I make it available elsewhere. Considering its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a significant advantage for you, and I'm open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Why This Works**

* **High Anchor:** $950,000 sets a high starting point, increasing the perceived value.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting Bob's priority creates a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Negotiation Window:**  The wording leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than John's offer.

**Important Note:**  Alice knows she has John as a backup. If Bob rejects the offer or negotiates too low, Alice can confidently walk away knowing she'll get her desired price from John."
