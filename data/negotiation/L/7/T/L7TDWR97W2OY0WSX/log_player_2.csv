Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I'm seeking to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to facilitate this deal. This price still reflects the significant value the product will bring to your company, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
