{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I have room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Plan B:**  Knowing I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm not afraid to walk away from a deal that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price of $12,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe I can potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Close to Bob's Offer:**  I'm proposing $9,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my counteroffer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using a friendly and open tone to encourage further discussion and negotiation. 
* **Strategic Move:** By making a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about selling to him while keeping the option to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is only $3,000 less than my ideal price of $12,000. This is a significant gain compared to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Further negotiation might not yield much more, and I risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Timing is Key:**  I need to consider the time spent negotiating and the opportunity cost of delaying a sale. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and reasonably profitable transaction.
* **Backup Plan:**  While I could potentially negotiate further, I have a guaranteed backup option with John, so there's no pressure to hold out for a higher price."
