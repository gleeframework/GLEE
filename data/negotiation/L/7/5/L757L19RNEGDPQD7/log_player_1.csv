Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price higher than what Bob might initially have in mind.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price without explicitly stating Bob's perceived value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, making Bob feel more comfortable countering if he finds the initial price too high.

While I have John as a backup, maximizing profit with Bob is the priority. This approach balances ambition with a reasonable chance of acceptance."
