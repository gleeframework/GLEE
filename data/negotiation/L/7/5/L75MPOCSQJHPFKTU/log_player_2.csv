"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it would be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.**  $11,500 is still more than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **There are 10 rounds, giving Bob room to negotiate.**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is a good start, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is still to save money.**  $11,000 is still over Bob's budget, and he can likely get it for less.
* **There are still 7 rounds left to negotiate.** Bob can continue to make counteroffers and try to drive the price down.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.**  Bob can always choose to buy from John if he can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,000 is closer, but still a bit high.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $10,750.  If we can settle here, I'm ready to make the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,750 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,875?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is still aiming for a lower price.** While $10,875 is closer to his budget than previous offers, there's still room for negotiation.
* **He has 5 rounds remaining.** This gives Bob ample opportunity to continue counteroffering and try to drive the price down further.
* **Buying from John is still a backup plan.** If negotiations with Alice fall through, Bob can still purchase from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $10,875 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's stick with my previous offer of $10,750.  I'm really hoping we can close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 10750}
