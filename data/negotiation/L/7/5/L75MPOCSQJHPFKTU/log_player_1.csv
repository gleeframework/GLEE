Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it would be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While I'd be happy to sell for $10,500, I think I can still get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is a good start, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,000 is closer, but still a bit high.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $10,750.  If we can settle here, I'm ready to make the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $10,750 is a better price than what he initially offered, I'm still hoping to get closer to my $11,000 target.  We've both made compromises, so I think there's still room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,750 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,875?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $10,875 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's stick with my previous offer of $10,750.  I'm really hoping we can close this deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's clear that Bob and I are not going to come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.  While I'd prefer to sell the product for more than $10,000, at this point, I'm happy with the guarantee of a sale from John."
