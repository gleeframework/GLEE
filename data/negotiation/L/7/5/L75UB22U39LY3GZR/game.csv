"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me, while also being more reasonable for you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
