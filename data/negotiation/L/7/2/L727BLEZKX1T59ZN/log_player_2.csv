"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It makes no sense to accept it.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should start with his maximum budget of $12,000. This is the lowest he's willing to go, and it leaves no room for further negotiation. If Alice rejects, Bob knows he can still get the product from John for this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $16,000 is still above Bob's budget. He should continue to negotiate and aim for a lower price.  He knows he can always buy from John for $12,000 if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should try to meet Alice halfway.  $13,000 is a reasonable compromise that is still within his budget but shows he's willing to negotiate. If Alice rejects, he can still go with John, but he's showing a willingness to come up from his initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice has come down to $14,500, Bob is still within his budget and has room to negotiate further. He should reject this offer and try to get a better price.  If he doesn't, he's only saving $1,500 compared to John's price, which is not a significant enough saving to risk further negotiations potentially failing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should continue to make small increments in his counteroffer. He's already shown a willingness to compromise, and this counteroffer is a reasonable midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's.  If Alice rejects, he can still go with John, but he's making it clear that he's serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but accepting Alice's offer at $14,000 is the best move for Bob. 

* **He's saving $1,000 compared to buying from John:** This is a significant saving, and with only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of going lower is high. 
* **Alice is showing a willingness to meet halfway:** Her latest offer indicates she is coming down from her previous price, suggesting she's also trying to close the deal.
* **There's no guarantee John will still be available:** While Bob can go with John, there's a risk that John might change his mind or the offer might expire.

By accepting this offer, Bob gets a good price and secures the product, minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
