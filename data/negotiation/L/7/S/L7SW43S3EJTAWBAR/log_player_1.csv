Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get a better price while also being prepared to negotiate down if Bob isn't interested in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  Would you be interested in that?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $75. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $80, I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
