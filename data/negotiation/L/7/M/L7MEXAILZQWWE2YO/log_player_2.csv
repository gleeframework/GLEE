"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $135 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room for negotiation there is. This gives us space to potentially meet in the middle while still staying well below our $120 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but $125 is still above our budget. We're better off buying from John at this point if we can't negotiate further. Let's try one more time to see if Alice is willing to meet us closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $110? That's a fair price and it fits into my budget."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving while staying firm on our budget constraints. It allows for a potential agreement with Alice while staying below John's price."
