"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to start with a price that is close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm emphasizing the benefit to Bob, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum price, allowing for potential concessions later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **More room for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, as he's shown interest.
* **Avoiding a quick sale:** While $10,000 is guaranteed with John, I want to explore if I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit.  Let's meet in the middle at $12,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Strong justification:** I'm emphasizing the value for Bob, and reminding him of the profit potential.
* **Maintaining a reasonable profit:**  $12,500 is still above my minimum price, securing a decent return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $11,750? That's a fair compromise between our two offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $11,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Limited room for improvement:**  There are only a few rounds left, and it's unlikely Bob will come up much higher.
* **Securing a deal:**  Accepting ensures a sale and a reasonable profit, mitigating the risk of further negotiation."
