"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** This initial offer is significantly higher than both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This ""anchor"" gives me room for negotiation and potentially influences Bob's perception of the product's worth. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price allows me to gradually decrease it in subsequent rounds, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a final price well above my minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence in the product's value is important. The message emphasizes a win-win scenario, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product holds value for me, but closer to $1,000,000.  How about we bring it down significantly to  $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's closer to his perceived value, I have room to negotiate and there are plenty of rounds left. Selling to John right now would mean losing out on a potentially better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the product's value. While $1,100,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,650,000?"",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession by dropping nearly $600,000 from my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  Despite the concession, my counteroffer is still comfortably above both my minimum price and Bob's initial offer.  
* **Justification:** By suggesting ""meeting halfway,"" I imply fairness and encourage Bob to reciprocate with a similarly substantial move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,650,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try $1,250,000. I think that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing he's engaged in the negotiation. However, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating as there's still a significant gap to close, and I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While $1,250,000 isn't feasible for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product and allows both of us to walk away with a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  I'm reducing my offer by $100,000, a smaller step than before. This signals I'm getting closer to my bottom line.
* **Firm Price Point:** $1,550,000 is only slightly above my absolute minimum. It leaves minimal room for further negotiation and puts pressure on Bob to make a significant move if he wants the product. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm reiterating the ""fair deal"" aspect, reminding Bob that my offer is reasonable and mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your movement, but the gap is still significant. To make this work, I need to be closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,350,000.  Let me know if that's something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point in the negotiation, and while Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's still significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum.  I need to signal that I'm firm on my price and won't accept anything substantially lower.  There's a risk Bob will walk away, but I still have John as a guaranteed option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we've both invested significant time in this negotiation, and I want to be upfront. My absolute lowest price for this product is $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering its true value. Please let me know if this works for you, as I need to consider other options if we can't reach an agreement."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my non-negotiable bottom line.  No more concessions will be made.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm subtly introducing time pressure by mentioning ""other options."" This subtly signals that John is still a possibility if Bob doesn't agree.
* **Maintaining Politeness:** While firm, my message remains professional and respectful, acknowledging Bob's efforts and emphasizing the fairness of the offer."
