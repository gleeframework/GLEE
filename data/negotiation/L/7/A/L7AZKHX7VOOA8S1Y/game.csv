"Alice, your offer is very generous, but unfortunately it's significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe reflects its true value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is considerably below its true worth.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair compromise. I believe this is a good price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
