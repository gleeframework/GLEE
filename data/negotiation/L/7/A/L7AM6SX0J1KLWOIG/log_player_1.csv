{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $11,999. I think it will be very valuable for you, and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 11999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible without going below her minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting with $11,999 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Guaranteed backup:**  Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's minimal risk in aiming high with Bob."
