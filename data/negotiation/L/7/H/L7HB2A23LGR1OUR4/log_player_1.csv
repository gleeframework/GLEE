{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is more beneficial to me than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It also leaves room for negotiation, potentially leading to a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to go 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price than John's offer, it's still below my ideal value. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, I'm aiming for a price closer to $925,000. Let's meet halfway to finalize this deal.  "", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $920,000. That's the best I can do 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price of $925,000,  $920,000 is a good compromise and still significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000. It's important to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial."
