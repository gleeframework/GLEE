Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value while still being fair for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to the product's value to Bob, but still allows for negotiation.  I'm also leaving room to make counteroffers if needed.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer if necessary or switch to selling to John if Bob proves unwilling to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired range with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000? That way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $11,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly better than selling to John, and it's likely that further negotiation wouldn't result in a significantly higher offer from Bob."
