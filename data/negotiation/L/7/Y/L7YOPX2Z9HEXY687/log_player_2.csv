Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price.  I'm willing to let this go to you for $1,550,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,550,000.  While she claims to have another buyer, this could be a negotiation tactic.  Even if true, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John offers a sure deal at $1,200,000, which is a significant saving compared to Alice's best offer."
