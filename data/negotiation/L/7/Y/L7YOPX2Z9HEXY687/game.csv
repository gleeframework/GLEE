,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,750,000 is still too high for my budget. I could potentially stretch to $1,100,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price.  I'm willing to let this go to you for $1,550,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
