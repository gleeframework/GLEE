"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1800000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth to me.  Let me know what you think!",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm open to negotiating,  $1400000 is still below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $1600000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $1500000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To show I'm willing to work with you, I'm willing to drop my price to $1550000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000 one last time. If you're not able to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
