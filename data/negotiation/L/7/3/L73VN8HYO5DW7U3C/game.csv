,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $75?  I'm really interested in this product.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $82? I'm still confident that this product is worth it to you.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $80.  That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $80 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $85 out of this deal. How about we meet in the middle again and try $82.5?",82.5,Alice,5,
