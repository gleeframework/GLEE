# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for you, as you've mentioned it's worth $8,000 to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you first. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
