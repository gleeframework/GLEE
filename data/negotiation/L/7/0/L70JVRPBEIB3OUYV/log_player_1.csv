Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly imply that the product is worth more than Bob might think, justifying the higher price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, you don't want to reveal this to Bob.  Keeping the existence of other interested parties hidden strengthens your position.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and invites discussion. You're not giving an ultimatum,  leaving room for Bob to counter-offer."
