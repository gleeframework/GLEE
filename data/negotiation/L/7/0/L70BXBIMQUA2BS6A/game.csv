"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget. However, $10,000 is still a bit too far from what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it's still a good deal for you.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  I'm willing to increase my offer a little, how about $8,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $8,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's the best I can do.",11000.0,Alice,7,
