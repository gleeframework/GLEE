Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe its value is significant and would be a great asset to you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know the product's value to Bob ($10,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), I want to start high to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A high initial offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate, which can be beneficial in understanding his perspective and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Backup plan:** Even if Bob rejects this high offer, I am  guaranteed to sell the product to John for my minimum price. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible outcome while minimizing risk."
