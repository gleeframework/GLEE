"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **Counteroffers can get you a better price.** By rejecting, you can try to get a lower price, potentially saving yourself some money. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.** This provides a safety net if negotiations with Alice fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in your product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and she's come down to $11,000.
* **The price is fair.** It's a good compromise, allowing you to save money while giving Alice a reasonable profit.
* **Further negotiation is risky.** There's no guarantee you can get a lower price, and you risk losing the deal altogether. 

At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible option. It secures the product for you at a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
