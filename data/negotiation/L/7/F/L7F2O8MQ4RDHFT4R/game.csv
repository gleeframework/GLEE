"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,800,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $1,600,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,350,000. Would that work for you?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I can do $1,700,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but we're still a bit apart. I can do $1,400,000 to make this deal happen today. This is a fair offer, considering I could always go with John.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,700,000, which is $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a compromise to close the deal. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,7,
