"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really only comfortable going up to $14,000.  I think this is a fair compromise considering I value the product at $10,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
