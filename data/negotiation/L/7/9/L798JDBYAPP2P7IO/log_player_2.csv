"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. If I buy the product from Alice, I'll be paying $750,000, but if I reject her offer and buy it from John, I can get it for $1,000,000, which is $250,000 more. That's a significant difference, so I'll reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
