"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering its potential return on investment.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the price is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However,  $1,150,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,187,500  - this is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",1187500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,125,000.
