Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, $1,200,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum value for the product. To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still provides you with significant value, and allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.
