"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product at a price of $9,500 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $9,500 is less than your $12,000 maximum, you know John will sell it for $12,000. There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one."
