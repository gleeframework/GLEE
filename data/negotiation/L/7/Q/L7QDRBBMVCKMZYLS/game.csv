,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of $1350000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1310000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. Can you consider that?",1310000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1310000 is a bit short of that. I'm willing to meet you at $1320000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the bottom line, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $1300000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is the absolute final offer, and I expect you to consider it seriously. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1280000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. However, if you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1200000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1280000.0,Bob,10,
