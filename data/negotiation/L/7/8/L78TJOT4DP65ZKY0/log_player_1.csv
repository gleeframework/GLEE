Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $180 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While you know Bob values it at $150, pushing too far above that (e.g., $200+) is likely to make him walk away without even considering a counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $180. He might counter-offer, or reject it outright. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
