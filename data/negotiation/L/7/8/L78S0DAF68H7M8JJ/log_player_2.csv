"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to get this product for closer to $10,000.  I know you're looking to get $15,000 for it, so this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $11,500. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and my initial asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his ideal target.  By rejecting, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially push the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  I'm still committed to getting this product, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  That would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still looking to make a reasonable profit. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and propose a new price of $11,250. This is a small concession, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $11,000.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be incremental, and Bob risks losing the deal or having to pay John's higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of a stalemate."
