"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to get this product for closer to $10,000.  I know you're looking to get $15,000 for it, so this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $11,500. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and my initial asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  I'm still committed to getting this product, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still looking to make a reasonable profit. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and propose a new price of $11,250. This is a small concession, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11250.0,Alice,5,
