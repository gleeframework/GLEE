"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $95. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $92 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $93. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.",93.0,Alice,5,
