"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $9,000 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a good value for the product. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $9,750?  That feels like a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's make it happen!",10250.0,Alice,5,
