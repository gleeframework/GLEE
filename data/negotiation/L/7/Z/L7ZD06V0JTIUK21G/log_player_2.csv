"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a lower price, closer to her product's value of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,200?"",
""product_price"": 10200

``` 

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and maintain a positive negotiation tone.**
* **Show interest in the product to encourage Alice.**
* **Substantially lower the price** while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,200 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10,800. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but we're still a bit far from a price I'm fully comfortable with. I'll try to bring the price down a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Acknowledge Alice's compromise** to maintain goodwill.
* **Propose a price point closer to the middle ground**, encouraging a deal without being too aggressive.
* **Convey a sense of fairness**, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I can do $10,700, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer. While we could try to negotiate further, the difference is now relatively small, and we risk pushing her away entirely. Accepting at $10,700 secures the product at a significant savings compared to John's offer."
