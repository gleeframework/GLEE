This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $902,500, a saving of $197,500 from John's price and $297,500 from Alice's initial offer.
* **Alice is Firm:** She's stated this is her final concession, signaling she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at the higher price. 

While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are unlikely to outweigh the risk of losing the deal at this point."
