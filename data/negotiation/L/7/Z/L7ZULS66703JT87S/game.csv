"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a very competitive price considering its worth to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the price down, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $11,250. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more of a discount.  How about we settle on $10,750? This would give us both a fair deal.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, Bob, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,7,
