"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum target. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $11,200? It's a bit more than your offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise.",11200.0,Alice,5,
