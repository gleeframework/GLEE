Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum target. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $11,200? It's a bit more than your offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $11,200 ensures you get the product at a price better than John's offer while avoiding the risk of Alice walking away."
