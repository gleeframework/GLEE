"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I want to make a deal,  $12,500 is too low. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  However, $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,800.  This is a fair compromise and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer, $12,800 is still significantly less than what I need to get for this product. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,900. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12900}
