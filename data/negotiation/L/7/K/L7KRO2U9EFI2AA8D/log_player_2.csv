"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer. He's aiming for a price closer to his $12,000 limit, and there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  However, $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still try to negotiate a lower price, and if he doesn't succeed, he has the option to buy from John at his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,800.  This is a fair compromise and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,900. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's slightly above his ideal price, it's still a good deal considering the value of the product. He has already rejected two counteroffers, and further negotiation might not be productive.  At this point, it's a better strategy to secure the product at a reasonable price rather than risk further rounds of negotiation and potentially losing the product to another buyer."
