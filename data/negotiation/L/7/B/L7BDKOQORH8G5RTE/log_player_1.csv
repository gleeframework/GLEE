Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is higher than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $120 is below the $150 value Bob places on the product, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's a friendly opening:** The message is friendly and inviting, which can help establish a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about $100? I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $100 is better than $80, it is still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. I can go down to $110.  That's still a fair price for the product, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105, and I think that's a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$105 is a good price. It's above my minimum of $80 and close to my desired price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
