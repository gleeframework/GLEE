"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a product worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm keen on the product but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to come down to $750,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $750,000 is closer, it's still a touch high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to come down to $700,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value to you and is a fair deal.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can do $650,000, but that's really pushing it for me. Let me know if that works.",650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a tough sell for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm willing to come down to $675,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price is still fair and reflects the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,7,
