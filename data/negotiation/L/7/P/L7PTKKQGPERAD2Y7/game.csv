"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure I can go that high. I was thinking more along the lines of $105 again. Can you reconsider?,105.0,Bob,6,

"I've already met you at $105 in a previous offer, Bob. I'm not willing to go back to that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $110, but that's my final offer. Take it or leave it.",110.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to come to an agreement at this price, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a deal for $115, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",115.0,Alice,9,
