Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** The $1,900,000 offer tests Bob's willingness to pay a premium. It allows room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""benefits"" to justify the high price, framing it as an investment rather than a cost.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk appetite and Bob's perceived negotiating style, you could start with a different price point."
