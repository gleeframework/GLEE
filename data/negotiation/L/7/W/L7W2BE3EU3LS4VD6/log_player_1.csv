"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $140. It's a steal!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** A positive and friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm highlighting the ""steal"" aspect to emphasize the potential value Bob could get. 
* **Room for Compromise:** This price allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, while still ensuring a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to keep my spending under $120. Would you be willing to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even lower than what I'd get from John.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** I have rounds left and can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoid Selling to John:**  While selling to John is safe, I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I can't go as low as $120, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $130? That's still a great price for this product!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize value again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth by saying it's still a ""great price.""
* **Maintain positive tone:** Keeping the message friendly can encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $120. Would you consider bringing the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No room for compromise:** Bob is insistent on his $120 price, which is below my minimum. 
* **Time is running out:**  We're already on round 4, and I have limited time to negotiate. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is significantly better than accepting Bob's offer. 

While I would prefer to get a higher price, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob outweighs the potential for a slightly higher offer in the remaining rounds."
