Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum price:**  $100 is higher than your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It states the price and provides a friendly opening message.

This strategy allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, which could lead to a higher final price.  If Bob rejects the offer, you can continue negotiating or sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $90? I think that's fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is still above your minimum price of $80, and it's likely he'll be unwilling to go much higher. Accepting his offer is a good choice since it secures a sale and a decent profit."
