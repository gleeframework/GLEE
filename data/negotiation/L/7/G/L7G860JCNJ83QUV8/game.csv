"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we meet at $92? That's the closest we can get to the original price of $110 while still being a good deal for me.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, but $92 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. How about we meet in the middle again at $96? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'd still be getting a good deal.",96.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $96. How about we try to get even closer to my target price of $90? Can you meet me at $94?,94.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $95. This is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it.",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $90. I'm willing to go up to $93, but no more. Can you meet me there?",93.0,Bob,8,
