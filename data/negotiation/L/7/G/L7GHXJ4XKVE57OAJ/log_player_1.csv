Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $10,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, we have room to negotiate. Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation downwards while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims to project value and subtly create a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to accept the offer without excessive bargaining.
* **Alternative Option:** By not revealing the guaranteed offer from John, we maintain leverage in the negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation.  In a real-world scenario, gauging Bob's reactions and adjusting the price accordingly would be crucial for maximizing profit."
