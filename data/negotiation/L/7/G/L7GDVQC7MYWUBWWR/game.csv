"Alice,  $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go higher than $850,000.  This is my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a great deal. While $850,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm very interested in your product, and I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a significant offer, and I truly believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
