```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a great deal. While $850,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you're still a long way off from your ideal price. There's a good chance you can bring the price down closer to your budget by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm determined to get the product for as close to $800,000 as possible.  One more counteroffer might be enough to close the deal."
