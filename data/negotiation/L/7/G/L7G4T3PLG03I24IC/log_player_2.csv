Round 3

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make a final concession and meet you at $1,110,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. I hope you'll accept it, as this is my last offer before I have to consider other options.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly lowering her price, she's unlikely to go below $1,100,000.  It's becoming too risky to continue negotiating. You can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John, saving you at least $310,000. It's time to cut your losses and secure the deal with John."
