"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below the product's worth.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value you'll gain from owning the product. Let's try to find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a touch higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I have 6 rounds remaining to negotiate. There's a good chance I can secure a higher price, particularly since Bob seems to be willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $725,000 is still quite a bit lower than what this product is worth.  I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value you'll gain. This is my final offer before I need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
