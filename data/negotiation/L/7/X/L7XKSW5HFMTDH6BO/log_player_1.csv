Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, $100 is still too low. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $100 is just not going to work for me. I'm willing to drop the price to $155. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $120 for it. Let's see if we can close the deal.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While I'd prefer to make more, Bob's offers are getting frustratingly close to my minimum price. I'm running out of time and John is a guaranteed sale."
