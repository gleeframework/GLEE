Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great value at $150. Would you like to take it off my hands?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $110? That's the highest I can go at the moment.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about $125?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $127.50? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",127.5,Alice,5,
