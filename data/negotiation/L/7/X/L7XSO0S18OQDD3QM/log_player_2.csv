"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth $80 to Alice and $100 to Bob, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer of $90 keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $80. Offering $85 is a reasonable starting point for the counteroffer. It shows Bob is serious about buying but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $87.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price:** $87.50 is a significant improvement from $90 and is relatively close to Alice's value of $80.
* **Time is a factor:** There are only 7 rounds remaining. Accepting now secures the product at a decent price without risking losing the deal to John or further negotiation delays. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Bob might be able to get a slightly better price, but the potential gains are small compared to the risk of further negotiation.

In this scenario, the potential benefit of saving a few dollars doesn't outweigh the risks associated with continuing to negotiate."
