"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and enthusiastic tone sets the stage for a collaborative negotiation.
* **Open to Discussion:** By asking Bob for his thoughts, I encourage him to engage in the negotiation and potentially offer a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While I could sell to John for $15,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I might be able to achieve a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **More rounds left:** I have 9 more rounds, which gives me ample time to try and find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. How about $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Benefit for Bob:**  The price is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and it's within Bob's perceived value range.
* **Clear Reason:** I'm providing a clear reason for the counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product and the need for a price that's fair for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Would $9,000 be acceptable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity to improve:** I have several rounds left, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **John's offer:** While I could sell to John for $15,000, I want to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I'd need to come closer to my desired price. How about $10,000? It's a fair compromise and a great deal for you considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate further by lowering my counteroffer again.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that my price is still a good deal for him.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  I'm trying to find a middle ground that is closer to my desired price while remaining within Bob's budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I think we're getting closer. Would $9,500 be a fair offer for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not enough:** While Bob's offer is moving closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I have several rounds left, and I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **John's offer is still attractive:**  While selling to John would be a quick and easy solution, I still want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $9,500 is a good offer, but I'm still a little below my target. Would $10,000 work for you? That would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I think it would be a great deal for you considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:** While Bob's offer is getting very close to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Only two rounds left:**  I have two rounds remaining, which is enough time to try and get a slightly better price.
* **John's offer is still on the table:** If I can't get a better deal with Bob, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $9,750 is tempting, I'm really hoping to get closer to $10,000. To make this work, I'm willing to drop my price just a little bit to $9,900. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I think you'd be happy with the value you're getting."", ""product_price"": 9900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  This is my final counteroffer before I'm forced to decide between Bob and John.
* **Slight Concession:**  I'm making a small concession to show flexibility, but still staying above Bob's last offer.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm framing this as a fair deal for both parties to encourage acceptance. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to reinforce that my price is still a good deal."

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I truly appreciate it. One last offer from me: $9,800. I hope this brings us to a satisfactory agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiations.
* **Close but not enough:** While Bob's offer is higher than my previous counteroffer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's offer is better:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a higher profit than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Risk of No Deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer risks ending the negotiation without a deal, leaving me with no sale. It's better to secure the guaranteed profit from John."
