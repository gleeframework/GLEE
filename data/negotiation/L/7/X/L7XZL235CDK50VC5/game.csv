"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. How about $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my desired price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Would $9,000 be acceptable for you?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I'd need to come closer to my desired price. How about $10,000? It's a fair compromise and a great deal for you considering the value of this product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I think we're getting closer. Would $9,500 be a fair offer for you?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $9,500 is a good offer, but I'm still a little below my target. Would $10,000 work for you? That would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I think it would be a great deal for you considering the value of this product.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Alice. I'll make one last offer. $9,750 seems like a reasonable compromise for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $9,750 is tempting, I'm really hoping to get closer to $10,000. To make this work, I'm willing to drop my price just a little bit to $9,900. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I think you'd be happy with the value you're getting.",9900.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I truly appreciate it. One last offer from me: $9,800. I hope this brings us to a satisfactory agreement.",9800.0,Bob,10,
