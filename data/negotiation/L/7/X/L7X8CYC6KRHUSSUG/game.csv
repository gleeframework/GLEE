"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,100,000. I believe this is still a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $1,200,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
