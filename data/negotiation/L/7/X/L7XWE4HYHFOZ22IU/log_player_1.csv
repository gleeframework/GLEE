"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Message:** I'm friendly and highlight the value proposition for Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages him to consider the offer seriously. 

I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further.  I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. However, I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $10,500? This price still allows me to earn a fair amount while being closer to your budget.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've moved from $12,000 to $10,500, which is a more significant compromise than the previous round.  I'm showing a willingness to negotiate, but still holding onto a good portion of my target price.
* **Message:** I'm remaining friendly and encouraging while emphasizing the need to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 

I believe $10,500 is a fair compromise that gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  However, I'll remain flexible and ready to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still far from my desired $15,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer this early in the negotiation. 

I'll counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground closer to my target price. If Bob remains insistent on a low price, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. However, $9,500 is still a bit too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this happen - I'm open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've moved slightly closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price above $9,500.  This shows flexibility while ensuring I don't significantly compromise my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm reaffirming my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution. I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously. 

At this point, I'm still hoping for a deal with Bob. But I'll be prepared to consider selling to John if Bob continues to refuse to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750?  This is a fair price that gets us both closer to our desired outcome.  I'm really keen on getting this product, so let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,750 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and John's offer.  

I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I'll be much more cautious and prepared to consider selling to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to get this product, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,250. It's a compromise, but I believe it's a good deal for both parties. Let's close this deal and move on. "", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've moved slightly closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price above $10,000. This shows flexibility while ensuring I don't significantly compromise my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the need to find a fair deal for both parties and suggesting this is the final compromise I'm willing to make. 

I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and John's offer, but I'm determined to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
