"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $10,500? This price still allows me to earn a fair amount while being closer to your budget.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let's close the deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. However, $9,500 is still a bit too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this happen - I'm open to discussing this further.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750?  This is a fair price that gets us both closer to our desired outcome.  I'm really keen on getting this product, so let's make this happen.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're eager to get this product, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,250. It's a compromise, but I believe it's a good deal for both parties. Let's close this deal and move on. ",10250.0,Alice,7,
