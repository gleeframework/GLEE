"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is more than he's willing to pay, and he has a fallback option with John.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $10,500? This price still allows me to earn a fair amount while being closer to your budget.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his desired price.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. However, $9,500 is still a bit too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this happen - I'm open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal, but keep John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750?  This is a fair price that gets us both closer to our desired outcome.  I'm really keen on getting this product, so let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're eager to get this product, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,250. It's a compromise, but I believe it's a good deal for both parties. Let's close this deal and move on.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has come down slightly, but she's still not willing to meet Bob's desired price.  With only 3 rounds remaining, Bob risks running out of time before he can get a lower offer from Alice.  Buying from John is the safest option to ensure he gets the product at a price he's comfortable with."
