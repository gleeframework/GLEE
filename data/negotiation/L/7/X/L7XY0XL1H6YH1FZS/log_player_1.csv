{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, considering the product is worth $150 to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $115. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point. I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  It's a fair price considering the value to you. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
