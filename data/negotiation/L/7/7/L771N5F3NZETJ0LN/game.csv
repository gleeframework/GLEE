"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I appreciate your offer, $10,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm asking for $12,500. This price reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $11,250. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your point about needing to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's meet at $11,750. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also making it affordable for you.  What do you say?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope we can meet at this price.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more. I'm proposing a final price of $11,625. This is a reasonable compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen.",11625.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $11,625 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,250, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet at this price, but if not, I'll have to consider other options.",11250.0,Bob,8,
