Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'd like to counter with an offer of $105 for the product. This still gives you a good savings compared to the original price while allowing us to maintain a fair margin. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $105 is within your budget and a good deal compared to John's price of $120.  While you might be able to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and you risk losing the deal.  Accepting the offer allows you to secure the product at a good price and move on."
