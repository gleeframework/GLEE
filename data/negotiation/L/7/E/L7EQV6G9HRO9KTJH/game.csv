"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  That's a fair compromise, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,3,
