"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than John's offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $11,000. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  That's a fair compromise, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
