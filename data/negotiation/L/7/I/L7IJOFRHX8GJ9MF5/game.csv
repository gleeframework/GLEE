"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not comfortable selling it to you for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $11,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to do $10,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",10750.0,Alice,5,
