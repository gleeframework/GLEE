"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. If Bob rejects, we can start lowering the price in subsequent rounds while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

I'm countering with $1,550,000. This is only $50,000 above my minimum value, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize that this is a fair price considering we are down to the last few rounds. If he rejects this, I will have to seriously consider selling to John to avoid losing out on a decent profit."
