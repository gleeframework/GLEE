"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you first.  I think you'll find it's worth a good deal more than my asking price of $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price ($120).**  You're aiming to save money, so accepting this offer is not ideal. 
* **Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer.** This gives you control over the negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $105.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting with a lower price:**  This sets a clear signal that you're serious about negotiating and gives Alice a clear starting point for a potential compromise.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $105 is within your budget and a decent compromise considering Alice's asking price. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the desire to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet halfway and settle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum price ($120).** While it's closer to your target, it's still not a good deal for you.
* **Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating.** You have more rounds left and can potentially drive the price down further. 
* **Buying from John is always an option:**  While John's price is higher, it's still within your budget. However, there's no reason to rush into that decision when you can still bargain with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference again and go with $107.50?  I'm hoping we can find a way to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** You're showing Alice you're serious about getting the product but also staying firm on your budget.
* **Splitting the difference:** This tactic is common in negotiations and signals a willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and emphasizes the goal of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $109 is my final offer. It's a great price for a product you'll really enjoy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  $109 is less than your maximum price of $120, making it a viable option.
* **It's a good compromise.** While you would prefer a lower price, Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and you've made progress from her initial offer.
* **Limited rounds remaining.** You have only 5 rounds left. It's unlikely you'll be able to push the price down much further, and there's a chance Alice will walk away.

**It's better to secure a deal within your budget than risk losing the opportunity and having to buy from John at a higher price.**"
