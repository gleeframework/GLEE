"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $130 is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $130 is below your minimum of $150, giving you some wiggle room for potential counteroffers. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This price is not too aggressive, allowing for a smooth and potentially mutually beneficial negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum of $150 and also lower than your initial offer of $130.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above your desired minimum. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $110 is exactly halfway between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling a desire for a fair resolution.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to see the value in accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $110 is closer, I'm still a bit high. Let's meet at $100. This is a fair price, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum of $150. You've already shown a willingness to compromise and are still in early rounds of negotiation. There's potential to reach a higher price with further negotiations.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to potentially get closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continued Compromise:**  This offer shows you're still willing to compromise, but are also pushing for a higher price. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  $105 is exactly in the middle of your previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows you're being reasonable and fair.
* **Urgency:** The message implies that you're willing to negotiate, but also suggests that a deal needs to be reached soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your compromise.  However, I'm still sticking to my budget of $100. I think it's a fair price for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where Bob has firmly stuck to his offer of $100 for several rounds.  There's a high chance that he won't budge further, and continuing the negotiation could lead to a stalemate. 

* **Time is running out:** We're in Round 6 of 10, and the longer we negotiate, the more likely it is that we'll reach a point where the deal falls apart.
* **John's offer:** We know we can sell the product to John for $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer. 

Selling to John guarantees a much better price and avoids the risk of continued negotiation with Bob.  While we might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars from Bob, the certainty of $150 outweighs the risk of further negotiation."
