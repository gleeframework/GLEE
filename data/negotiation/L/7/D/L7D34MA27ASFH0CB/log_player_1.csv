Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $10,000 is higher than the $8,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $10,000 is still above your minimum price of $12,000, leaving you with some room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's a good starting point:**  This price allows for a back and forth negotiation, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price. 

It's important to keep in mind that you have the option to walk away and sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $12,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's room to negotiate with Bob. He's expressed interest, and I'm confident that I can get a better price than his initial offer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I'm not desperate for a deal, knowing that I can sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations fail.

**Next steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum but still lower than my original offer.  This will show that I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrate that his initial offer is unacceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While I value the product at more than $8,500, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This gives you a good price while also allowing me to get closer to my target.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still protecting my financial interests.
* **Middle ground:** $9,500 is a midpoint between Bob's offer and my initial offer, suggesting a potential for agreement.
* **Motivating factor:** This offer could incentivize Bob to make a final move towards a deal.

By offering $9,500, I'm signaling that I'm serious about selling to Bob but also that I won't accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. This approach maximizes the chance of reaching a mutually beneficial deal while keeping John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000. If you're not able to meet me there, I'll have to go with another option.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum price of $12,000.
* **Potential for a deal:**  The difference between his offer and my desired price is now smaller, making a deal more likely.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away and I'll be left with selling to John for $12,000, which is less ideal.

**Conclusion:**  While $9,000 is still below my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether.  It's also possible that I might be able to negotiate for a slightly higher price in the future if we build a relationship."
