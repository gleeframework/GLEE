"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While I value the product at more than $8,500, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This gives you a good price while also allowing me to get closer to my target.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000. If you're not able to meet me there, I'll have to go with another option. ",9000.0,Bob,4,
