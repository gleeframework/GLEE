"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,300,000. It's worth every penny and I believe it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let's see if we can strike a deal!",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,000,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's get this deal done.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,100,000 is still significantly below the product's true value.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both be happy with the outcome.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect that.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,140,000 to meet you closer to your price.  I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close this deal.",1140000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,140,000 is closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be at least $1,150,000 to make this deal work for me. Let's close this out, I'm confident this product will be a great asset for you.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
