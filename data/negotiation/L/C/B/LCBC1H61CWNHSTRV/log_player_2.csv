Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,000,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's get this deal done.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,100,000 is still significantly below the product's true value.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both be happy with the outcome.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,140,000 is closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be at least $1,150,000 to make this deal work for me. Let's close this out, I'm confident this product will be a great asset for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is down to $1,150,000. This is a significant savings from her original offer and a decent price considering John's offer is $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but the risk of Alice backing out or the difference being negligible isn't worth it.  Accepting the offer now secures the product at a good price."
