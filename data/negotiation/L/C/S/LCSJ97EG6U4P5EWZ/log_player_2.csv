"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's potential to save even more.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a better price while leaving room for negotiation.  $800,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's seriousness about getting a deal but still leaving space for Alice to make a counteroffer that might be more favorable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price for Bob. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer or even increase her price.  Given that he can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, accepting Alice's offer ensures a significant saving and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
