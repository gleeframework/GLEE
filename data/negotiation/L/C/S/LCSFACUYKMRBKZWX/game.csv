"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I believe this product has potential, your initial offer seems a little high. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the initial price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher. Considering your offer of $700,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $850,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's still a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could meet you at $750,000. I believe this is a fair offer reflecting a good deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting close, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Considering your offer of $750,000, I'm willing to make a small concession and counteroffer at $825,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, that price is still a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to go as high as $775,000.  If that doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any higher than $825,000. Your latest offer of $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make a small concession and meet you in the middle at $800,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.
