"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $13,000. I believe this price reflects its value and presents a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly more than your own valuation of the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This price acknowledges the value you see in the product while still providing me with a fair return.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This price would still give you a significant profit while allowing me to save some money. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
