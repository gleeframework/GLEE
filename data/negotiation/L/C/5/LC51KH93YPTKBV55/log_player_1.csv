Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  Keeping the message friendly and positive is important to build rapport.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By saying ""Let me know what you think,"" I'm acknowledging that I'm open to negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:**  I know I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I'm not desperate to sell, so rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and get a better price through further negotiation. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being interested in the product.  While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $10,000, which is still above his initial offer but closer to his perceived value. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Open-ended Question:**  By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm signaling that I'm open to further negotiation.
* **Maintaining my Minimum:** $10,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing out on a significant amount of money."
