"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $12,000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your offer. I understand your budget constraints, however, I know the true value of this product is considerably higher. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my original offer of $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to walk away if it doesn't work for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $12,000 is his absolute limit and he's ready to walk away.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome. Since John is offering the same amount, it makes sense to cut losses and sell to John."
