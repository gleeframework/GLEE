"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while still allowing you a healthy profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000. I believe this price is fair given the value of the product and allows for a healthy profit for you. Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to be upfront. I've got another potential buyer who's offering $1,100,000. To be fair to you, I'm willing to let this product go for $1,150,000.  This is my final offer. It represents a significant discount on its true value and allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. ",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another potential buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement before I explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
