"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $10500. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still out of my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8500.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is still a bit steep for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $9800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you is $8000.",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $9800 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $9000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10000 and my budget is $8000. Let's close this deal!",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $9200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you is $8000.",9200.0,Alice,7,
