"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $130, which is more than your maximum budget of $100.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $130 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $118. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate further. There's a chance she might be willing to go lower, and even if she doesn't, you can always buy from John for a guaranteed $100."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. However, $118 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $110? I'm really interested in this product, and this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $115. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.
