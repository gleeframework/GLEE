"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in this product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential for you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher tests his willingness to pay a premium.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (even if general) for the price makes it seem less arbitrary and more grounded.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is substantially lower than both your minimum ($1,200,000) and your initial asking price. Accepting it would mean a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still plenty of room for negotiation. Bob's low offer might be a tactic to see how low you're willing to go. 
* **John as Backup:**  We have the security of John's offer ($1,200,000), so we can afford to be more assertive in negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me with a counteroffer.  However, $900,000 is significantly below the market value of this product and my initial asking price was significantly higher. To be fair to both of us, I could consider $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Reject:**  We politely acknowledge Bob's offer while making it clear that it's unacceptable.
* **High but Moving:** We're reducing our price from $1,500,000 to $1,350,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate but keeps us firmly above both Bob's offer and our minimum.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's market value to anchor the negotiation around a higher price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $1,350,000, we aim to steer future counteroffers closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the price needs to work for both of us.  While I'm serious about purchasing this product, I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Could you do $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to our minimum price, but it's still not enough.
* **Negotiating Position:** We're only $100,000 away from our minimum, and Bob has moved significantly from his initial offer. This suggests we have leverage. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We have a limited number of rounds, so it's time to start nudging Bob closer to our desired outcome while we still have the option to walk away."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This is my final offer, and I believe it is a fair reflection of the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're coming down to our absolute minimum price, making it clear that this is our final offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" we appeal to a sense of fairness and compromise. 
* **Time Constraint:** With fewer rounds remaining, we need to apply pressure to reach a decision quickly.
* **John as Backup:**  We're still willing to walk away from the deal with Bob if he doesn't accept, as we have the security of John's offer."
