"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to profit.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. To be honest, $1,200,000 is the highest I can go.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
