Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it can be a great addition to your operations. My initial offer is $1,450,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product could be valuable for me, I need the price to be more in line with my budget. How about we start the conversation at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low, and it's worth taking a few more rounds to see if we can find a more mutually beneficial price. Selling to John guarantees my minimum value, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. To be honest, $1,200,000 is the highest I can go.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price,  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity. I'll accept his offer and move forward with the sale."
