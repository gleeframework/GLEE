Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still too low, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations.  I'm not yet at a point where I need to sell to John, as I want to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our initial offers.  How about $900,000?  This would allow both of us to come away with a fair outcome."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
  
I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer, even though he's moved closer to my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I believe I can potentially get closer to my target price. Selling to John at this point would be a loss for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your latest offer, it's still a bit below my target.  Let's split the difference between our last offers. How about $887,500? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this deal will be beneficial for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 887500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $880,000 is getting very close to my minimum price of $800,000.  While I would ideally like to get a bit more, I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for a lower price.  I think this is a reasonable compromise and a fair deal for both of us."
