Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? It's a fair offer considering the quality and potential of this product."",
""product_price"": 18000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still considerably less than both our minimum and John's offer. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $15,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $16,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while still being a good deal for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now offering $14,000, which is very close to John's guaranteed $15,000 offer. While we could try to push for the full $15,000, there's a risk Bob might lower his offer or walk away in the next round. Accepting $14,000 now secures a good deal and avoids the potential loss of selling to John."
