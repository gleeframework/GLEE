"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $75. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $85 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  I really want to get this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",82.5,Bob,4,
