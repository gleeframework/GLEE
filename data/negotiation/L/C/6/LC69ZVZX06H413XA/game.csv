"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1000000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make the deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1200000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is still a good price for you, considering your own valuation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
