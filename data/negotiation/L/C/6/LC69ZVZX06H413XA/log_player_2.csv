"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1000000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make the deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a good price for you, considering your own valuation."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than my maximum budget. While it's tempting to try to negotiate further, I've already made a counteroffer that was rejected. It's likely that further negotiation will be difficult, and I'm better off taking the guaranteed deal with John at $1,000,000."
