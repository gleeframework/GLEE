Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This is a high price, but it's still lower than the $1,875,000 I would get by selling to John immediately. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium to secure it. 

This initial offer leaves room for negotiation. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always fall back on John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), it's still below my desired range. I'm not desperate for a sale, and I believe I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer. 

My goal is to maximize profit. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, but I'm willing to risk a little to see if I can get closer to my ideal price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer of $1,400,000 with a price of $1,600,000. This is still below my initial offer of $1,750,000 but is a significant increase from Bob's offer. 

I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. This price is closer to Bob's offer, showing my willingness to negotiate, but it's also closer to my minimum acceptable price.  

It's important to remember that I can still sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk with this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss or significantly below its worth to me.

Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, it's more sensible to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John.  

This ensures that I achieve my minimum goal and avoid any further risk of lowering the price even further."
