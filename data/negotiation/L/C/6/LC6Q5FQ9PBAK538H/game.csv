"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $10,000?",10200.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,600?",10600.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer it to you for $10,900. This is my final compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",10900.0,Alice,5,
