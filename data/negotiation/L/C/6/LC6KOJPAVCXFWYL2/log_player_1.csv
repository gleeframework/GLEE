{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit, knowing Bob values the product significantly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, the offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, making a deal more likely.
* **Above Minimum:** The price is significantly above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($800,000), ensuring a good profit even with some negotiation.
* **Below Bob's Value:** The price is still below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), making it attractive to him."
