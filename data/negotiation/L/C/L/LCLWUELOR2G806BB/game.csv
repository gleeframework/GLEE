"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $1,025,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's right in the middle of our current positions.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can make a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a minimum price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'll make one more concession and meet you at $1,030,000. This is my last offer, so I hope we can finalize the deal.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
