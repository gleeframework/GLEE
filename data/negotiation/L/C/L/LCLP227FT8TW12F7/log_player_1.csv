Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This offer starts with a price that is significantly higher than your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate. It's important to understand that Bob may find this price unreasonable, and this is just the first step in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum,  rejecting it allows for a counteroffer. It's worth exploring whether Bob is willing to pay more than his initial offer, which would be more profitable for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

This counteroffer is halfway between your minimum acceptable price and Bob's initial offer. This shows you are willing to negotiate but also that you value the product higher than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is slightly higher than John's offer, so it's more beneficial to accept it. While it's not the ideal price, it's still above your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a rejection by Bob."
