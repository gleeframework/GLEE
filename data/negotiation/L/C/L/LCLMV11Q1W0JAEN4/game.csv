"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great value, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $150?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $165. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we meet at $162? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",162.0,Alice,5,
