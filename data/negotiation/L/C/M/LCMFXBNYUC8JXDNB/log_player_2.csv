Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too far below my desired value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we compromise at $1,200,000?  It's a fair price that acknowledges the value you'll gain from the product, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is getting down to the wire.  I want to make this deal happen, but $1,185,000 isn't quite working for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,195,000?  This price is a fair compromise for both of us, and ensures we both walk away happy with the deal.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,195,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is right:**  $1,195,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation progress:** Alice has consistently moved closer to your desired price range, showing she's willing to compromise.
* **Limited rounds:**  You have fewer rounds left, and continuing to push hard could make Alice less flexible or even lead to an impasse. 

This deal secures you a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
