"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,700,000, which reflects the value I see and leaves room for negotiation. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $2,100,000. This adjustment reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true value of this product and its potential benefits for your business.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,100,000 is still beyond my comfort zone. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,900,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still a bit higher than my ideal price, but I'm willing to meet in the middle at $1,950,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our perspectives and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal now.",1950000.0,Bob,6,
