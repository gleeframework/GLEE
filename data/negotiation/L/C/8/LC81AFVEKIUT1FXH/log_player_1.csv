{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $9,500 is a good starting point. It's close to my minimum value ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  The message focuses on the value to Bob and avoids putting pressure on him. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially adjust my price if needed. 

**Next steps:** 

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own. 
* **If negotiations stall or become unproductive:** I'll move on to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $9,500 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This still leaves some room for me to make a profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm reducing my price from $9,500 to $9,000, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain profit:** $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get and reiterating my confidence in the product's worth.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll have to consider his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or continue negotiating.
* **If negotiations stall:**  I'll move on to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price of $10,000, it's still below what I consider acceptable.
