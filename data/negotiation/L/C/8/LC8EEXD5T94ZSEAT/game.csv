"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. It's a steal considering its value, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $150?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $150 is a bit out of my budget, I would like to propose $130 as a compromise. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle at $140.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. Considering your last offer and my budget constraints, I would like to suggest $135 as a fair compromise. I believe this is a reasonable price for both parties.",135.0,Bob,6,
