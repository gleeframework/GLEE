"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you for $120. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is your maximum budget. There's no room for negotiation upwards. By rejecting and counter offering, you have the potential to get a better price from Alice and still have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $100?"",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($100), we aim to see how flexible Alice is and potentially secure a great deal.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is framed politely to maintain a good negotiating atmosphere while clearly stating our desired price. 
* **John as Backup:** We always have the option of going with John at $120, so there's room to negotiate without the risk of losing the product entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has met us in the middle. $110 is a good price, saving us $10 from our maximum budget and a decent compromise from our initial offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significantly better results, and we risk pushing Alice away."
