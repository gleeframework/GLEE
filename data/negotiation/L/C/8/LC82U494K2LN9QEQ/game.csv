"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I truly believe this product is worth every penny. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000, which is closer to my budget. This represents a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
