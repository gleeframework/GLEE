Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This offer is above your minimum price of $8,000, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  This allows for a potential win-win scenario where you get a good price and Bob still gets a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's worth trying to get closer to the $10,000 mark.  Rejecting his offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer is still lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is only $500 less than my initial counteroffer, and it's more than John is willing to pay. It's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure the sale."
