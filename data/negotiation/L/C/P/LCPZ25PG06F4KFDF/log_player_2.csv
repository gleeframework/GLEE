"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get the product for cheaper than $90. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay.  Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$85 is still higher than I'm willing to pay, and I have several rounds left to negotiate. I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm going to offer $80.  This is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to meet her halfway, but it's still below her last offer.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to her."
