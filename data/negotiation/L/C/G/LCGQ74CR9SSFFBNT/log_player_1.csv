Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation of $8,000 but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. 
* The message is friendly and open to negotiation, inviting Bob to engage in a conversation. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll either:

* **Accept his counteroffer:** If he offers a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Counter with a lower price:** If his counteroffer is too low, I'll try to meet him halfway.
* **Stop negotiation and sell to John:** If I feel the negotiation is going nowhere or Bob is being unreasonable, I'll switch to John for my guaranteed $15,000."
