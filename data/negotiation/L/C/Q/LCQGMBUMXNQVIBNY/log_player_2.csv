"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is quite close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than their asking price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message maintains a positive tone, expressing interest in the product while clearly stating your price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $10,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concession:** Alice only came down $500 from her initial offer. This suggests she might be willing to negotiate further.
* **Still Above Value:**  $10,500 is still closer to your maximum budget than your desired price. Continuing to negotiate keeps the pressure on Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that price point work for you?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're increasing our offer slightly from $9,000 to $9,500, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Still Below Their Offer:** Our counteroffer is strategically positioned below Alice's latest offer, keeping the negotiation moving in our favor. 
* **Clear Target:** By stating a specific price point, we're signaling our ideal outcome and prompting Alice to respond more definitively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to your target, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,250. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pattern of Small Concessions:** Alice is sticking to a pattern of small concessions ($250 each round). This suggests we might be able to squeeze out a bit more. 
* **Nearing the End:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds.  It's a good time to start applying more pressure.
* **Alternative Option:**  It's good to keep the option of buying from John ($12,000) in mind as a fallback if Alice doesn't budge enough."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We're proposing a price exactly halfway between our last offer ($9,500) and her current offer ($10,250). This is often seen as a fair compromise.
* **Stronger Language:**  ""A fair deal for both of us"" emphasizes that we're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Putting the Ball in Her Court:** By making a firm offer, we're signaling that this is likely our final compromise, encouraging Alice to make a decision."
