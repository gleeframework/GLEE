"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better deal than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $11,500? That's still a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $11,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $12,250? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $12,250 is a better deal than John's offer, there's still potential to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and try for a price closer to his ideal."
