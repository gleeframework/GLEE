Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because it is:

* **Slightly lower than your minimum value:** You are still willing to make a profit.
* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is below Bob's perceived value of the product.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially adjust the price if Bob counters with a lower offer.

By starting the negotiation at this price, you are maximizing your chances of getting a good deal while still leaving room for flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is still more than what Bob is willing to pay, it is closer to your minimum value.  Therefore, it's worth pushing for a higher price. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer and attempt to secure a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest!  I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $13,500?  I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you are getting closer to your minimum value.  Accepting Bob's offer of $13,250 would still be a decent profit, considering his initial offer was only $13,000. It's not ideal, but it is a good compromise and avoids the risk of further negotiation or the potential loss of a sale to John."
