"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it, considering my budget and the fact that I can get a similar product from John for $100.  Let me know if that works for you.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering your willingness to pay $95, I am willing to accept that amount for our premium product. This allows us both to reach an agreeable solution.",95.0,Alice,3,
