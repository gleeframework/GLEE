"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement on that price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price.  Let's split the difference and settle on $950,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $925,000 is my absolute maximum. Can we meet at that price?",925000.0,Bob,4,
