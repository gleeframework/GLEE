Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth $15,000.  Are you interested?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Starting High:** A common negotiation tactic is to start with a higher price than you expect to get. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the higher price in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, given the product's worth to him ($10,000), starting with a price closer to that value might encourage him to negotiate rather than walk away outright."
