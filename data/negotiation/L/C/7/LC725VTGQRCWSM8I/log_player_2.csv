"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:

The product is worth $15,000 to Bob. Alice's offer is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I value your offer, $16,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $18,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

``` 

Alice's offer of $18,000 is still above my limit, but closer.  I'll counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $17,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 17000}
