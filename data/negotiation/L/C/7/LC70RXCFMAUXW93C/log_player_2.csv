It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. $1,400,000 is still above my target, but there's room to bargain."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not quite ready to pay $1,400,000.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

While $1,300,000 is closer to my target, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, which is $1,250,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.

I'm still willing to try to negotiate a lower price. I'm close to my target price and I have a few more rounds left."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm committed to reaching a deal.  However, $1,250,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1,225,000. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1225000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I need a bit more. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000, but I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. Let's discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice seems stuck at $1,250,000 and I'm only willing to go as low as $1,225,000.  With only a few rounds left, the risk of not getting a deal is high. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."
