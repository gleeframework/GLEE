"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,400,000 for the product.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not quite ready to pay $1,400,000.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that should work for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a realistic compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, which is $1,250,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm committed to reaching a deal.  However, $1,250,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1,225,000. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I need a bit more. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000, but I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. Let's discuss the details.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
