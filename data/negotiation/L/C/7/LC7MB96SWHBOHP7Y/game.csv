"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $120 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $125. This is my final offer, as I can always just buy from John for $120.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go down to $125 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession - how about we meet at $130? It's a great compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",130.0,Alice,5,
