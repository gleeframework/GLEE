Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but also leaves room for negotiation.
* This price is below the product's value to Bob ($15,000), so there's incentive for him to accept.
* This strategy allows for potential back-and-forth negotiation, giving me a chance to increase the price further if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* However, if Bob rejects this offer, I have a backup in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out on a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my desired price:** While $10,000 is better than my minimum of $8,000, it's still less than what I'm aiming for. 
* **Potential for a better price:** I believe I can secure a higher price by continuing negotiations with Bob. He's already shown interest and is willing to pay more than John.
* **Minimizing risk:** Rejecting his offer and counteroffering allows me to keep the negotiations going without losing the sale entirely. I have a backup plan with John if the negotiations fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is willing to go higher.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to hold out for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **No guarantee of a higher offer:**  There's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's $8,000 offer.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit close to my minimum goal. 
* **Time factor:**  The back-and-forth negotiation might be taking too long, and accepting this offer avoids further delay."
