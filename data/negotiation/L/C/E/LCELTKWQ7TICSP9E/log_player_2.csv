# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm not comfortable going below $900,000. This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be able to get a fair price for my product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.
