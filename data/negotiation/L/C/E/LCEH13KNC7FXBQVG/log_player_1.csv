Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I think this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 allows some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price above your minimum. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message focuses on the product's benefits to Bob, reinforcing why he's willing to pay a premium over John's offer.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he is for the product. If you had more insights into Bob, the offer could be adjusted accordingly."
