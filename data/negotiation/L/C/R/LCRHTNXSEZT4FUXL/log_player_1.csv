Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,150,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for him to counter-offer and reach a price you're both happy with.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** By offering a price closer to his perceived value, it shows you're serious about selling to him, and encourages him to negotiate.

**Remember:** This is just a starting point. You can adjust the price based on your understanding of Bob's negotiation style and your own risk tolerance."
