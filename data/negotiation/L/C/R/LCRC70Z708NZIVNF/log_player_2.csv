**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above her value of $1,200,000, but it's still higher than my ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, we're still not quite there yet. We're willing to meet you at $990000, which is the highest we're willing to go. We believe this is a fair price considering the value we place on the product and the value you've expressed it has for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $990,000 is still above her value of $1,200,000, which means there's still some room for her to make a profit.  However, it's also below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, and  I'm  reasonably confident I can't get a lower price from Alice without risking losing the deal."
