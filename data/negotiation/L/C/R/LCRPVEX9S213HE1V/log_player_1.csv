Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $115 tempts Bob with a small discount (he values it at $100) while still securing a profit above your minimum ($120).
* **Clear Communication:** The message is concise and highlights the ""special price"" to entice Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
