**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on price, she is unlikely to reach our target of $80 or lower.  At this point, it's more strategic to cut our losses and buy from John for a guaranteed $80. This avoids the risk of Alice not coming down enough in the remaining rounds and ensures we stay within our budget."
