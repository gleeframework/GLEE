"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,150,000 is a significant step down from my initial proposal.  This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet halfway at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $1,225,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle between $1,150,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm also confident in the value this product brings. Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle between $1,175,000 and $1,200,000, which would be $1,187,500. However, I'm willing to go slightly higher to $1,180,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
