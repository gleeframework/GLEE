"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product to me. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the potential upside for me and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $950,000.  This price reflects a significant discount for you and allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.  I'm confident that this deal will be profitable for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
