"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering my valuation and your desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, however,  I believe the value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This offer reflects my effort to find a compromise while still respecting the inherent value of what I'm offering.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise considering our valuations, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
