"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about $150?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to sell the product without needing to go to another buyer. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you want to make a fair deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $150. How about $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, $130 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $140?  That's a fair compromise, and it would get us both closer to our desired price.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $140. How about $135? I think that's a fair price, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go.",135.0,Bob,6,
