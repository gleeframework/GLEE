{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation while still leaving room for me to potentially earn more than my minimum of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than my minimum, I think I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}

I'm offering $16,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is close to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and could potentially get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering $14,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still lower than my previous counteroffer, showing flexibility. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob and we can finalize a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $13,000 is still a decent amount and more than my minimum.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal if I continue negotiating, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
