"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I think it's a fair starting point for something that could benefit you greatly.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $950,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is a little too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a lower price point. However, I believe you'll receive significantly more value from this product, making a higher price worthwhile for you. My final offer is $887,500.  ",887500.0,Alice,5,
