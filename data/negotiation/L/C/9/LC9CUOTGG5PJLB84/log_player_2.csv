Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $700,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also signals I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but if not, we can continue to negotiate in subsequent rounds."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 740000}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds left, I need to increase my offer significantly to demonstrate my seriousness. I'm aiming for a compromise that's fair to both of us. This offer is a considerable jump from my previous offer but still leaves room for Alice to negotiate. I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough to convince Alice to accept.  If not, I'll have to weigh the risk of going to John with only two rounds remaining."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, the risk of not getting a deal with Alice is too high.  While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still more than I want to pay.  The time constraint and the risk of a complete breakdown in negotiations make buying from John the more sensible option at this point."
