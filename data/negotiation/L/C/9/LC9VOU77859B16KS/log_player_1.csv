Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives me a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to offer you $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows you to make a decent profit while still being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my ideal price.  I'm not yet ready to settle for this amount, and I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob or John in subsequent rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,150,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This would still allow you to make a substantial profit and help us close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,075,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I've already dropped my price significantly from my initial offer, and there's still room for Bob to budge. I'm not ready to settle yet and believe I can negotiate a higher price in the next round. I'll also continue to consider selling to John as a backup option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This price is fair, considering the value of the product to me and your profit margin. Let's reach an agreement and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have a few rounds left to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price, potentially closer to my ideal price of $1,250,000.  I'm not ready to settle for this amount yet and will continue to negotiate with Bob. However, I will keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob breaks down."
