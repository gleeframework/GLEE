Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
