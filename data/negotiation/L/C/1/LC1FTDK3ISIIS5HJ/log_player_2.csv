# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its exceptional quality and value, I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. Considering its worth to us, I propose a price of $140 for this item. This price reflects the product's high value and ensures a fair transaction for both parties. I look forward to your response and hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is lower than her perceived value ($150), it's still more expensive than your maximum budget of $120. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $120, making it the most financially sound decision."
