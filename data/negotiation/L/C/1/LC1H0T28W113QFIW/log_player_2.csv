# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,500, which is a great deal considering its worth to me. Let me know if you're interested! If not, I'll be selling it to someone else for a higher price.

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of a better deal from Alice or can always fall back on your option with John."
