"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm really hoping to make this deal work.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $97.50 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $102.50 to make this work.  Let's try to close this deal.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is the price I was initially interested in when I considered buying it from John. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100?",100.0,Bob,6,
