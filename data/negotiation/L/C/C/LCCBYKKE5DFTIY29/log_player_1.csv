Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $1,100,000 creates a sense of value while leaving space to potentially settle closer to his $800,000 perceived value. 
* **Alternative Option:** Highlighting that this is an exclusive offer before I move on to another buyer (John) might encourage Bob to act quickly.

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming to secure the best possible deal with Bob before resorting to the guaranteed sale with John."
