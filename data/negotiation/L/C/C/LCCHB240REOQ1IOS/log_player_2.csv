You have three options:

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $120.  You can get the same product from John for $80.  You'll make a counteroffer to Alice and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

You're going to try to get Alice to sell the product for your maximum price of $80.  This is a bold offer, but you're hoping Alice might be motivated to sell rather than risk losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $100 is still too high. You're happy to buy from John for $80 and avoid further negotiation."
