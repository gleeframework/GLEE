"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money and the product is worth no more than $15,000 to him.  Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is far too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer that is still within his maximum budget. This counteroffer is aggressive but might be enough to get Alice to negotiate seriously. It also leaves some room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still too high. He has already shown Alice that he's willing to walk away, so it's worth pushing for a lower price. There are still several rounds left, so there's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown a willingness to come down in price. Now, Bob is making his final stand at his maximum price. This is a serious offer, and it's likely that Alice will either accept or make a counteroffer close to this amount. If Alice rejects, Bob has the option to go with John, so there's no risk in this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high.  Bob is willing to walk away and buy from John, and  there are still more rounds to negotiate. It's worth pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to come down, but still not at Bob's maximum.  This counteroffer is a compromise that is still within Bob's budget and shows that Bob is serious about getting a deal done. It's a final offer, and if Alice rejects it, Bob will go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and while $16,500 is more than Bob's ideal price, it is still within his budget. There are only a few rounds left, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better price. Accepting this offer ensures that Bob gets the product within his budget, and it avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
