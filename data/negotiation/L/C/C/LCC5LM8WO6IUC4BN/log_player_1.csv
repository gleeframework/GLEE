Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Value Proposition:**  I mention that I believe the product is of great value. This subtly hints at its worth without disclosing specifics.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I invite Bob to respond, showing I'm open to negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on:

* **His counteroffer:** If his counteroffer is reasonable, I might accept.
* **His hesitance:** If he seems hesitant, I may lower my price slightly in subsequent counteroffers.
* **His unresponsiveness:** If he doesn't respond, I may move on to John to ensure I get at least $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, there's still room to negotiate upwards. Selling for $12,000 would leave less profit than I'd like.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John as a Backup:** John's offer of $10,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price between $12,000 and $15,000. I'll aim for a price that balances the potential for a deal with Bob while still maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,500? That's still a fair price given the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $15,000 to $13,500.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm still open to further negotiation, suggesting I'm willing to meet somewhere in the middle.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I want to counteroffer again or move on to John.
* **Consider John's Offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob stall.
* **Adjust Strategy:**  I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $13000? That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer is only $500 away from my previous counteroffer and is getting closer to my desired price point. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $10,000.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though I'm not getting my top price, accepting this offer could potentially lead to future business with Bob if he's satisfied with the product.

**Next Steps:**

* **Confirm the Sale:**  I'll confirm the details of the sale with Bob and proceed with the transaction.
* **Evaluate Future Strategies:** I'll learn from this negotiation and consider how to better assess potential buyer value in future dealings."
