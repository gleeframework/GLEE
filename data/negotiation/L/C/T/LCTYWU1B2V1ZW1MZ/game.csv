"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is my final offer. Let's finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but $825,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This is a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefit in this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $780,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value this product brings you, I believe $800,000 is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,7,
