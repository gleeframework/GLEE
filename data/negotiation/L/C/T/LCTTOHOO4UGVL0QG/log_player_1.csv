Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a good starting point.** It's a fair price that leaves room for negotiation and still gives me a good profit. 
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will get.** This makes the offer more appealing and sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

I'm confident that this offer will get the negotiation going.  We'll see if Bob accepts, makes a counteroffer, or if I need to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to stay within my budget of $12000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer but not too low:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get a good price. 
* **Message emphasizes the value for Bob:**  I'm reiterating that he still gets a good deal even at $9,500.  
* **Keeps the negotiation open:**  I'm not closing the door completely and hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'd like to try to get closer to my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,800 is still a bit lower than my ideal price of $10,000, it's a significant improvement over selling to John for $8,000.  Given that Bob has already rejected my counteroffer twice, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a higher price, accepting his offer is the best choice.  I'm still earning more than my minimum desired price of $8,000 and securing the sale."
