"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 was a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,250. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,250 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package that's worth $500. So, the total value you'll get is $9,500. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer and the additional service package. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,000 for the product itself. I'm willing to pay $8,800, and keep the service package. This way, we can both get a fair deal without having to overvalue the package. What do you think?",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'm not willing to go lower. However, I'll reconsider the service package and remove it from the deal. I'll sell the product to you for $9,000, and we can discuss the service package separately. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product.  This is a fair price considering we're both close to our desired price.  Let's make a deal and move on.",8900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,900. I'll meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,900, which is $8,950. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8950.0,Alice,9,
