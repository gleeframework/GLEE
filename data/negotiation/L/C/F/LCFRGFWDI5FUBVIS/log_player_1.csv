Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a bit above my minimum, but I'm hoping to get a good deal. If Bob rejects, I'll see how much he's willing to offer and adjust my counter-offer accordingly.  I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, but I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counter-offering with $125. It's a bit of a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear he's not willing to budge from his $100 offer. Since I'm guaranteed $100 from John, I'll take the safe option and sell to John."
