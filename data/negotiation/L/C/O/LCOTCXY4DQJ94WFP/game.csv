"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to offer $700000, reflecting the value I see in the product and its potential benefits.  What are your thoughts?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm still not convinced it's enough to cover the value I believe this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. My revised offer is $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $775000, which reflects a fair compromise and a price I believe is reasonable given the product's potential.  I'm confident this price is a win-win for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to meet you at $795000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
