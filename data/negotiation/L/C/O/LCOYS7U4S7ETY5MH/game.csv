"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $1,100,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value this product brings.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000? This would be a good compromise and allows us both to get a fair deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
