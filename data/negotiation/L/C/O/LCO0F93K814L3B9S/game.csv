"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in this product but $950000 is higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750000. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850000 is closer, I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go to $800000, which is my absolute maximum.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825000 is still slightly above my budget. To make this work, I'd need to come in at $800000. It's my absolute maximum, and I'm ready to make a deal at that price.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really close to your budget, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering you a price of $825000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free maintenance package and a 1-year warranty. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a fair price. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $825000.",825000.0,Alice,7,
