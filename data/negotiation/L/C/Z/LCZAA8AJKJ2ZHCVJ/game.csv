"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering it's the most I'm willing to spend.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That's a fair compromise.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,250 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This is a good price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate you working with me.  However, I have a hard limit at $9,500.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
