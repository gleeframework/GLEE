{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I believe $1,125,000 is a fair reflection of that. It represents a small concession on my part, while still acknowledging the value you'll gain from this."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,125,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,075,000, which is $1,050,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is anchoring hard on his valuations and seems unwilling to move much. While $1,050,000 is a good profit, we still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to $1,100,000.  We're not in a desperate situation yet where we need to take John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I believe your final offer undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to agree on $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're drawing a line in the sand at $1,100,000. This keeps us above our minimum but also shows Bob we're willing to negotiate seriously.  By framing it as our final offer, we increase the pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle between $1,050,000 and $1,100,000, which is $1,075,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has split the difference again, and while it's not our ideal price, it's a strong offer.  We're now past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk Bob will become more firm in his position or walk away altogether. Accepting $1,075,000 guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of continuing the negotiation."
