"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $110? That's a fair price.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $110, which would be $125. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
