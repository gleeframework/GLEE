Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for the maximum value.  Since I can always sell to John for $120, there's no downside to starting at this price. Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired $120.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $115. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal without having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my desired $120 than John's offer. It's also more likely that Bob will agree to a price closer to $120 in future negotiations, as he's already shown a willingness to pay more than his initial offer."
