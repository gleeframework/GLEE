"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,750?  I'm really serious about buying this product, and this is the absolute highest I can go.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really serious about buying this product, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,750 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $13,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,5,
