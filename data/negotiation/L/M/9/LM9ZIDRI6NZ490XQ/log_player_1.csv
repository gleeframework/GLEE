Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it at $150 and know John will buy it, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more than his perceived value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $145 is slightly below my ""guaranteed"" price and positions the offer as potentially time-sensitive, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a single offer, starting slightly high leaves a small buffer if Bob tries to negotiate down."
