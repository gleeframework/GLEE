"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $14,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. I'm willing to go up to $17,000, which is a bit closer to my target price. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
