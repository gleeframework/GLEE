Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This gives him a decent discount while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still above my minimum price of $100 and very close to my initial offer. It's in my best interest to accept his offer to secure the sale and avoid further negotiation."
