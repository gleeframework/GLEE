Round 2

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counteroffer at $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

The product is worth $12,000 to me, and Bob's offer is too low. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me. How about $10,500?  This would still be a great value for you, and gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4

# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $10,200 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200

While Bob is getting closer, $10,200 is still too low for me. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  I'm still not quite comfortable with $10,200.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,350. That way we both can be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 10350}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice. Thank you for your efforts. I would like to counteroffer at $10,300 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're already halfway through the rounds.  It's getting risky to keep negotiating, especially with John standing by to offer me my desired price.  I'm going to sell to John."
