"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $650,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $650,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a fair deal while ensuring you get a great return on your investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market. I'm open to further discussion and hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
