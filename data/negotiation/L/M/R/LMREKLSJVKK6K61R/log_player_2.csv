"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $1,200,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, and there's room for improvement."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. Let me know if that works for you.

Bob should still try to negotiate a lower price. $1,150,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his target.  He can likely get it lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,125,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At this point, it's clear that Alice won't go lower than $1,125,000. While this is higher than his ideal price, it's still significantly lower than buying from John for $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer is the most financially advantageous option."
