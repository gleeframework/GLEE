"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I think it would be perfect for your needs. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This accounts for both of our interests.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose $9,750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be closer to $10,500 to make this work. How about $10,625? This is a very fair offer.",10625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,625. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll propose $10,312.50. Can you consider that?",10312.5,Bob,6,
