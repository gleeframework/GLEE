"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know its value to you is high, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, but I'm open to discussing this further. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There's no need to buy from John yet, as Bob has more negotiating power in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer below Alice's price:** Bob's counteroffer is below Alice's initial price, showing his willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning for the price:** The offer of $1,300,000 is still above Alice's minimum value of $1,200,000, leaving room for potential agreement.
* **Message:**  Bob's message is polite and reaffirms the value of the product while justifying his counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal.  I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  This is a compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above what I can afford right now.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,325,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer below Alice's price:** Bob's counteroffer is again below Alice's offer, showing his commitment to negotiation.
* **Reasoning for the price:**  The offer of $1,325,000 is a compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer. This indicates a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Message:**  Bob's message is polite, acknowledging Alice's previous offer, and emphasizes the fairness of the compromise."
