"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get us started. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product and would like to make an offer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it allows us both to make a good deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,280,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit, but also acknowledges your interest in the product. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,3,
