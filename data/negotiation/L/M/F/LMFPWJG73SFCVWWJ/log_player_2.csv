"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1000000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $800000 for the product. This is a 20% discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.
